# [[Linking Content](../../..//templates/temp/linking%20content.md)

# Description

1. Within Obsidian, links are the means by which data is structured and relationships are drawn.
2. Obsidian allows the linking of content to a note at **3** levels ^0266aa

---

| Result | Command | Example |  
| ----------------------------------------[[Linking Content#Details]]Linking Content#Details]]------------- |  
| Link to an entire note | `[[name of the note][[Linking Content#^0266aa]]ent](../../../../../..//Templates/Template%20Hub/Templates/Obsidian-Vault-Structure/03%20-%20Content/Linking%20Content.md) |  
| Link to a n[[Linking Content#^0834a4]] |`[[name of the note#heading]]`| [[Linking Content#Details]] |
| Link to a block within a specified heading | `[[name [[Linking Content#^0266aa]]Linking Content#^0266aa]] |

1. At each stage of linking, the relevant content can instead be embedded by adding the *!* prefix ^0834a4
 1. Examp[[Linking Content#^0834a4]]Linking Content#^0834a4]]
 2. As you can see above, a reference *ID* is added to the target block of text
 3. As you're linking, Obsidian will parse and present all possible headings/blocks for selection

## How To Link?

1. Within the TrustedSec Obsidian vault, *links* are used as a replacement for what would more traditionally be considered *tags*.
2. Example:
 1. Over time a vault grows and several links are created to a recurring category that is not yet created. Links with no associated note can be readily identified:
  1. from a note's preview pane as they'll be displayed with a faded text
  
![[Pasted image 20210907120756.png](Template%20Hub/Templates/Obsidian-Vault-Structure/03%20-%20Content/files/Pasted%20image%2020210907120756.png)  
  3. from the graph's view, where unlinked notes/nodes will appear in a different color

```ad-important
If you're using included CSS snippets nonexistant nodes become a bit more visable as they're colored dark red.
```

### Before

### After

1. "Unlinked Mentions" as these unlinked notes are refered to, can then be created simply by clicking the identified unlinked *link* or *node*
2. If you're using templates when creating new notes, the hierarchical folder structure above your new note is automatically applied to the note a series of links. Unlike [[Tagging Content|Tags]], several *links* should be added to new notes with the idea that more meaningful links creates more relationships/opportunity for relationships between notes. This process should ultimately lead to a natural distillation of categorical knowledge and thus a new category and MOC.
