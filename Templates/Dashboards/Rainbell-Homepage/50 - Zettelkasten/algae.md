# algae

alga /ˈalgə/ noun. Pl. algae /ˈaldʒi:, ˈalgi:/. M16.  
Latin = seaweed.

description :: 水藻

*Algae* is actually the plural form of the word *alga*, which in Latin means, you guessed it: "seaweed." Algae isn't just something gross looking floating on the water. It's actually important in aquatic ecology because the tiny organisms that live suspended in algae are the food base for most marine food chains.
