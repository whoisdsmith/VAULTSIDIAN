```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
    ("![](" + photo + ")") as Photo,
    file.link as Name,
    "Birthday: " + dateformat(birthday, "yyyy-MM-dd") AS Birthday,
    "Age: " + split(string((date(today) - birthday).year), "\.", 1) + " years" AS Age,
    "Anniversary: " + dateformat(choice(BD < date(today), BD + dur(1 year), BD), "yyyy-MM-dd") AS Anniversary,
    "Countdowns: " + (choice(BD < date(today), BD + dur(1 year), BD) - date(today)).days + "天" AS Countdowns
FROM #parrot
WHERE photo
FLATTEN date(date(today).year + "-" + dateformat(birthday, "MM-dd")) AS BD
SORT choice(BD < date(today), BD + dur(1 year), BD) ASC
