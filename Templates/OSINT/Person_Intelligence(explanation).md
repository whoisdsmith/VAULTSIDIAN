# Intelligence Template for a Person 🔍
Make sure that when you download the [`person_intelligence.md`](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/Obsidian/blob/master/person_intelligence.md) file, that you keep the format as it is. If you don't keep the same format you won't get the tabs like on the screenshot below.
You just need to download it and to drag it into Obsidian.
