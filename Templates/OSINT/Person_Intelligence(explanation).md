# Intelligence Template for a Person üîç
Make sure that when you download the [`person_intelligence.md`](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/Obsidian/blob/master/person_intelligence.md) file, that you keep the format as it is. If you don't keep the same format you won't get the tabs like on the screenshot below.
