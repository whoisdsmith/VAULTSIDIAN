 ## Mapping Ancestors
 - Once you have completed the family tree, you can click on open local graph to get a graph view, but the Mind Map is much better for viewing the Tree.
 <br>

 ## How to get the Mind Map plugin in Obsidian
 - Go to **Settings** (bottom-left)--> **Community Plugins** --> **Turn off Safe Mode** --> **Browse Community Plugins** --> **Type Mind Map** --> **Install**
 - The code to this plugin is open source and can be found here: [Obsidian Mind Map by James Lynch](https://github.com/lynchjames/obsidian-mind-map)

 ## Activating Mind Map
 - Do not forget to toggle the button in **Community Plugins** --> **Installed Plugins** to activate Mind Map
 <br>

 ## Viewing your Ancestry Intelligence with the Mind Map Plugin
 - Once that you have finished writing down your notes/Intelligence and would like to view your data as a Mind Map:
 - Go to --> **Open Command Palette** --> Type **Mind Map** --> **Preview the current note as a Mind Map**

 <br>

 ## Template 
 - You will notice that each person has 2 sets of brackets around them, example: [[Father]], this lets you do a right click on each person and --> create file.


 - You can have a file on each person and you can input much more detailed information such as full name, date of birth, place of Birth, date of death, text/many notes and any amount of text, import screenshots, photos, .txt files etc.. 


 - [Download the Ancestry Template](https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/Obsidian/blob/master/Ancestry_template.md) in .md format, then, in Obsidian click **create new Vault** --> **create new file** --> and simply **drag the Ancestry_template.md file into the newly created file.** 

- I also made an Intelligence Template for people searches, based on Surveillance and Law Enforcement files, you can download it here: https://github.com/C3n7ral051nt4g3ncy/Obsidian/blob/master/person_intelligence.md
