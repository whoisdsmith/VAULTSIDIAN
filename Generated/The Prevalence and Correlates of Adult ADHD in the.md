Blinded clini­ Cal Follow-up Interviews of Adult ADHD

# J. Although it Has Long Been Known That Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Often Persists into adult­ Hood (1, 2), Adult ADHD Has Only Recently Become the fo­ Cus of Widespread Clinical Attention (3-5). As an Indication of This Neglect, Adult ADHD Was Not Included in Either ma­ Jor U.S. Psychiatric Epidemiological Survey of the Past Two Decades, the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study (6) or the National Comorbidity Survey (7). Attempts to Estimate the Prevalence of Adult ADHD by Extrapolating From child­ Hood Prevalence Estimates Linked with Estimates of adult­ Hood Persistence (8-11) and Direct Estimation in Small Subject Groups (12,13) Have Yielded Estimates in the Range of l%-6%. In Order to Obtain More Accurate Estimates of Prevalence and Correlates, an Adult ADHD Screen Was in­ Cluded in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (14), and Clinical Reappraisal Interviews Were Carried Out with People Who Had Positive Results on the Screen. These Data Are Used Here to Estimate the Prevalence, comorbid­ Ity, and Impairment of Adult ADHD in the United States.

## Were Carried Out with 154 Respondents, Oversampling Those with Positive Screen Results. Multiple Imputation Was Used to Estimate Prevalence and Correlates of cli­ Nician-assessed Adult ADHD. **Results:** The Estimated Prevalence of cur­ Rent Adult ADHD Was 4.4%. Significant cor­ Relates Included Being Male, Previously Married, Unemployed, and non-Hispanic White. Adult ADHD Was Highly Comorbid with Many Other DSM-IV Disorders as­ Sessed in the Survey and Was Associated with Substantial Role Impairment. The ma­ Jority of Cases Were Untreated, Although Many Individuals Had Obtained Treatment for Other Comorbid Mental and sub­ Stance-related Disorders. **Conclusions:** Efforts Are Needed to in­ Crease the Detection and Treatment of Adult ADHD. Research is Needed to deter­ Mine Whether Effective Treatment Would Reduce the Onset, Persistence, and Severity of Disorders That Co-occur with Adult ADHD.

### **Method** **Sample** As Detailed Elsewhere (15), the National Comorbidity Survey

# Replication is a Nationally Representative Survey of 9,282 Englishspeaking Household Residents Age 18 or Older That Was Carried Out by the Professional Survey Staff of the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. The Response Rate Was 70.9%. Re­ Cruitment Featured an Advance Letter and Study Fact Brochure fol­ Lowed by a Visit From an In-person Interviewer to Answer ques­ Tions Before Obtaining Verbal Informed Consent. Consent Was Verbal Rather Than Written to Parallel the Procedures of the base­ Line National Comorbidity Survey (7) for Trend Comparison. The Human Subjects Committees of Harvard Medical School and the University of Michigan Both Approved These Procedures. The Interview Was in Two Parts. Part 1 Included a Diagnostic as­ Sessment Administered to All 9,282 Respondents. Part 2 Included Additional Questions Administered to 5,692 Respondents in Part 1 Who Either Met the Criteria for at Least One Part 1 Disorder or Were Part of a Probability Subsample of Others. Because of Concern About Recall Failure Among Older Adults, ADHD Was Assessed in Part 2 Only Among the 3,199 Respondents Ages 18-44. This Sample Was Weighted to Be Nationally Representative. More Details About Weighting Are Reported Elsewhere (15).

The respondents were divided into four strata to select the ones who would receive clinical reappraisal interviews to determine

adult ADHD: respondents who denied ever having symptoms of

childhood ADHD, those who reported symptoms but did not meet the full criteria for childhood ADHD, those with childhood

cases who denied adult symptoms, and those with childhood

cases who reported adult symptoms. An attempt was made to

contact by telephone 30 respondents in each of the first three

strata and 60 in the fourth and to administer a  semistructured

clinical interview for adult ADHD to them. The final quota sample included 154 respondents (slightly more than the target because more predesignated respondents kept their appointments to be interviewed than expected). The sample was weighted to be rep­ resentative of the U.S. population in the age range of the sample. Details on the design of the ADHD clinical reappraisal are re­ ported elsewhere (16).

**Adult ADHD**

# The Retrospective Assessment of Childhood ADHD in the Na­ Tional Comorbidity Survey Replication Was Based on the Diagnos­ Tic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (17). Respondents Classified Retrospectively as Having Had ADHD Symptoms in Childhood Were Then Asked a Single Question About Whether They Continued to Have Any Current Problems with Attention or hyperactivity/impulsivity. The Clinical Reappraisal Interview Used the Adult ADHD

Clinical Diagnostic Scale version 1.2 (18,19), a  semistructured in­ terview that includes the ADHD Rating Scale (20) for childhood ADHD and an adaptation of the ADHD Rating Scale to assess cur­ rent adult ADHD. The Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale has been used in clinical trials with adult ADHD patients (21, 22).

Four experienced clinical interviewers (all doctoral-level clini­

cal psychologists) carried out the clinical reappraisal interviews. Each interviewer received 40 hours of training from two board-

certified psychiatrist specialists in adult ADHD (L.A., T.S.) and

successfully completed five practice interviews. All clinical inter­ views were tape recorded and reviewed by a  supervisor (M.J.H.). Weekly calibration meetings were used to prevent drift. A  clinical

diagnosis of adult ADHD required six symptoms of either inatten­ tion or hyperactivity-impulsivity during the 6  months before the interview (DSM-IV criterion A), at least two criterion A  symptoms before age 7  (criterion B), some impairment in at least two areas

of living during the past 6  months (criterion C), and clinically sig­ nificant impairment in at least one of these areas (criterion D). No

attempt was made to operationalize the DSM-IV diagnostic hier­

archy rules (criterion E).

**Comorbid DSM-IV Disorders**

# Other DSM-IV Disorders Were Assessed in the Survey by Using the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) Version 3.0 (23), a Fully Structured Lay-

administered diagnostic interview. The disorders include anxiety

disorders, mood disorders, substance use disorders, and inter­ mittent explosive disorder. Rules involving exclusion of patients with organic causes and diagnostic hierarchy rules were used in making diagnoses. As detailed elsewhere (15), blinded clinical re­

appraisal interviews using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) (24) with a  probability subsample of survey re­

spondents showed generally good concordance of DSM-IV diag­ noses based on the CIDI and SCID, with an area under the re­

ceiver operator characteristic curve of 0.65-0.81 for anxiety

disorders, 0.75 for major depression, and 0.62-0.88 for substance use disorders. The diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder was not validated, as there is no gold standard clinical assessment for this disorder.

**Other Correlates of Adult ADHD**

# We Examined Associations of Adult ADHD with Sociodemo-

graphic characteristics and functional disability as assessed with

the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule (25). This measure as­

sesses the frequency and intensity of difficulties experienced over

the past 30 days in each of three areas of basic functioning—mo­

bility (e.g., walking a  mile), self-care (e.g., getting dressed), and

cognition (e.g., remembering to do important things)—and three

areas of instrumental functioning—time out of role (i.e., number

of days totally unable to carry out normal daily activities and

number of days of cutting back on amount done or time spent on

daily activities), productive role performance (e.g., cutting back

on quality ofwork), and social role performance (e.g., controlling

emotions when around other people). Dichotomous measures of

disability were defined for each domain by giving equal weights to

frequency and intensity of impairments and classifying people

with composite scores in the 90th percentile as being disabled.

Treatment was assessed in each diagnostic section and in a  sepa­

rate treatment section where we asked about treatment for any

emotional or substance use problem. Comparison of responses

to the more and less inclusive questions pinpointed people in

treatment for comorbid mental or substance-related problems

# Multiple Imputation (26) Was Used to Assign Predicted diag­

noses of clinician-assessed adult ADHD to respondents who did

not participate in the reappraisal interviews. As will be detailed, a

strong monotonic relationship was found between sampling

strata and blinded clinical diagnoses of adult ADHD, justifying

this use of multiple imputation. We began by selecting 10 pseu-

dosamples of size 154 with replacement from the 154 respon­

dents in the clinical calibration sample, estimating predicted

probabilities of adult ADHD in each sampling stratum of each

pseudosample and transforming probabilities to case classifica­

tions separately for each case by random selection from the bino­

mial distribution for the predicted probability. These imputations

were then used to create 10 separate “data sets” in which substan­

tive analyses were replicated. The parameter estimates in these

replications were averaged to obtain multiple-imputation param­

eter estimates, while parameter variance was estimated by com­

bining the mean within-replication variance with the variance of

the parameter estimates across the replications by means of stan­

dard multiple-imputation averaging (26). The increase in vari­

ance due to between-replication variance adjusted for the vari­

ance introduced by using imputation rather than direct clinical

Sociodemographic correlates were estimated by using logistic

regression analysis, again separately in the 10 multiple-imputa­

tion replications. Comorbidity was assessed by obtaining multi­

ple-imputation estimates of odds ratios for the relationship of

adult ADHD to other DSM-IV disorders in logistic regression

equations that controlled for age in 5-year age groups. Functional

disabilities were also estimated by using multiple-imputation lo­

gistic regression. Twelve-month treatment was estimated by us­

ing multiple-imputation cross-tabulations. Because the sample

design used weighting and clustering, all parameters were esti­

mated by using the Taylor series linearization method (27), a  de­

sign-based method implemented in the SUDAAN software sys­

tem (28). Significance tests of sets of coefficients used Wald chi-

square tests based on design-corrected multiple-imputation co­

efficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance

was evaluated by using two-sided design-based tests with an al­

## Three Additional Limitations Are Also Noteworthy. First, Adult ADHD Was Assessed Comprehensively Only in the Clinical Reappraisal Subsample.

conservative, although the only study we know of that compared self and informant assessments of adult ADHD in nonclinical subjects showed fairly strong associations between the two reports (41). Third, even though the semistructured interview used in the clinical reappraisal interviews, the Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale, had been used in clinical studies of adult ADHD, there is no standard method for clinical validation of adult ADHD with the same level of accep­ tance as the SCID has for anxiety, mood, or substance use disorders, limiting the interpretability of results. Within the context of these limitations, the results re­ ported document that adult ADHD is common and often produces serious impairment. The 4.4% estimated preva­ lence is in the middle of previous estimates. This estimate is likely to be conservative for the reasons we have just de­ scribed. The findings that adult ADHD is associated with unemployment and with being previously married are broadly consistent with results from studies that have doc­ umented adverse effects of adult ADHD (8, 42). The analy­ ses of responses to the WHO Disability Assessment Sched­ ule are also consistent with this broad pattern. However, the disability results might underrepresent ADHD impair­ ments because some dimensions of the scale tap areas in which ADHD does not produce great impairment (e.g.,

## People with ADHD Are Often Very Mobile and overwork)

## And Because the Scale Does Not Assess Many Dimensions in Which People with ADHD Are Thought to Function Least ad­

## Equately (e.g., Poor Sleep and Nutrition, Accidents, and

## Smoking Are common). In Addition, as Already Noted, peo­ Ple with ADHD Might Have Poor Insight into Their impair­ Ments, Leading to Underestimation of Scores on the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule.

## The Finding of Low Prevalences Among Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks Was Unexpected. As the DSM-IV ADHD Field Trials Indicated No Effects of race/ethnicity

## (43), These Findings in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication Could Reflect a race/ethnic Difference in Adult Persistence, in Accuracy of Adult Self-report, in Cultural Perceptions of the Acceptability of ADHD Symptoms, or

## Some Combination. The Finding That Adult ADHD is signif­ Icantly More Prevalent Among Men Than Women, in com­ Parison, is Consistent with Much Previous Research (44). The 1.6 Male-female Odds Ratio is Comparable to the Odds Ratios Found in Studies of Children and Adolescents, sug­ Gesting That Childhood or Adolescent ADHD is No More Likely to Persist Int O Adulthood Among Girls Than Boys (45). This Indirectly Suggests That the High Proportion of Women in Adult ADHD Patient Groups is Due to Help seek­ Ing or Recognition Bias (46). The Finding That Adult ADHD

is highly comorbid is consistent with clinical evidence

## (42). Methodological Analysis Has Shown That These co­ Morbidities Are Not Due to Overlap of Symptoms, impreci­

## Sion of Diagnostic Criteria, or Other Methodological con­ Founds (47).

## The Average Magnitude of the Odds Ratios Reflecting the Relationship Between Adult ADHD and Other Comorbid

## Disorders is Comparable to Those for Most of the DSM-IV

## Anxiety and Mood Disorders Assessed in the Survey (48). The Absence of Strong Variation in Comorbidity Odds Ratios Was Surprising, as Family Studies Would Lead Us to Predict High Comorbidities with Major Depression (49), Bipolar

## Disorder (50, 51), and Conduct Disorder (52, 53) and Lower

## Comorbidity with Anxiety Disorders (54). One Striking im­ Plication of the High Overall Comorbidity is That M Any P eo­ Ple with Adult ADHD Are in Treatment for Other Mental or

## Substance Use Disorders but Not for ADHD. The 10% of Re ­

## Spondents Diagnosed with ADH D Who Had Received treat­ Ment for Adult ADHD is Much Lower Than the Rates for anx­==== Iety, Mood, or Substance Use Disorders (55). Direct-to-

## Consumer Outreach and Physician Education Are Needed to Address This Problem.

## The Comorbidity Findings Raise the Question of Whether

## Early Successful Treatment of Childhood ADHD Would in­ Fluence Secondary Adult Disorders. The Fact That a diagno­

## Sis of Adult ADHD Requires at Least Some Symptoms to be­ Gin Before Age 7 Means That the Vast Majority of Comorbid

## Conditions Are Temporally Secondary to Adult ADHD. We Know From the Multimodal Treatment Study of ADHD That

## Successful Treatment of Childhood ADHD Also Reduces

## Childhood Symptoms of Comorbid Disorders (56). Indirect

## Evidence Suggests That Stimulant Treatment of Childhood ADHD Might Reduce Subsequent Risk of Substance Use dis­

## Orders (57), Although This is Not Definitive Because of pos­

## Sible Sample Selection Bias. Long-term Prospective re­

## Search Using Quasi-experimental Methods is Needed to Resolve This Uncertainty.

## A Related Question is Whether Adult Treatment of ADHD Would Have Any Effects on the Severity or Persistence of co­ Morbid Disorders. A Question Could Also Be Raised as to Whether ADHD Explains Part of the Adverse Effects Found in Studies of Comorbid DSM Disorders. A Number of stud­ Ies, for Example, Have Documented High Societal Costs of

## Anxiety Disorders (58, 59), Mood Disorders (60, 61), and

## Substance Use Disorders (62, 63), but These All Ignored the Role of Comorbid ADHD Reanalysis Might Find That comor­ Bid ADHD Accounts for P Art, Possibly a Substa Ntial Part, of the Effects Previously Attributed to These Other Disorders. **Acknowledgments**
