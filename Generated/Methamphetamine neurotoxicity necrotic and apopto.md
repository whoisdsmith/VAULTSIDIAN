# Methamphetamine Neurotoxicity: Necrotic and Apoptotic Mechanisms

# Colin Davidson3, Andrew J. Gowc, Tong H. Lee3, Everett H. Ellinwood3’b *

## Research into Methamphetamine-induced Neurotoxicity Has Experienced a Resurgence in Recent Years. This is Due to (1) Greater Understanding of the Mechanisms Underlying Methamphetamine Neurotoxicity, (2) Its Usefulness as a Model for Parkinson’s Disease and (3) an Increased Abuse of the Substance, Especially in the American Mid-West and Japan. It is Suggested That the Commonly Used Experimental One-day Methamphetamine Dosing Regimen Better Models the Acute Overdose Pathologies Seen in Humans, Whereas Chronic Models Are Needed to Accurately Model Human Long-term Abuse. Further, We Suggest That These Two Dosing Regimens Will Result in Quite Different Neurochemical, Neuropathological and Behavioral Outcomes. The Relative Importance of the Dopamine Transporter and Vesicular Monoamine Transporter Knockout is Discussed and Insights into Oxidative Mechanisms Are Described From Observations of nNOS Knockout and SOD Overexpression. This Review Not Only Describes the Neuropathologies Associated with Methamphetamine in Rodents, Non-human Primates and Human Abusers, but Also Focuses on the More Recent Literature Associated with Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species and Their Contribution to Neuronal Death via Necrosis and/or Apoptosis. The Effect of Methamphetamine on the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential and Electron Transport Chain and Subsequent Apoptotic Cascades Are Also Emphasized. Finally, We Describe Potential Treatments for Methamphetamine Abusers with Reference to the Time After Withdrawal. We Suggest That Potential Treatments Can Be Divided into Three Categories; (1) the Prevention of Neurotoxicity if Recidivism Occurs, (2) Amelioration of Apoptotic Cascades That May Occur Even in the Withdrawal Period and (3) Treatment of the Atypical Depression Associated with Withdrawal. © 2001 Elsevier Science BV.

**1. Introduction**

# Methamphetamine (MA; /V-methyl-O-phenyl iso­ propylamine) is a Cationic Lipophilic Molecule with Potent Action on the Sympathetic and Central Nervous Systems. Repetitious High-dose Abuse of Amphetamines (e.g., Damphetamine (AMPH) or MA binges) Result in Near Steady-state Plasma Levels and Can Lead to a Prolonged (6-12 months) Withdrawal Period. This Raises the Question of Whether Neurotoxicity, or at Least Some Long-term Functional Changes Have Led to the Extended Withdrawal Rather Than the Usual, More Moderate, Anergia and psycho­ Asthenia Associated with Stimulant Withdrawal. PET imag­ Ing and Post-mortem Studies in Humans Have Shown Decreases in Indices of Dopamine (DA) Function, However, More Detail of MA Neurotoxicity Has Been Gleaned From Animal Studies. Such Studies, Currently Are Using pre­ Dominantly One-day Acute Toxic Dose (ATD) MA, Have Shown Loss of DA and Serotonin (5-HT) Terminals and Related Pathology. The Early Prevailing View Was That These Neurotoxic Effects Were the Result of a Direct Chemical Insult. MA Enters the terminals/neuron via the DA or 5-HT Transporter (DAT and SERT, respectively) and Displaces Both Vesicular and Intracellular DA/5-HT. These Displaced Amines Are Oxidized (by MAO and auto-oxida­ tion) to Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS; [44,186]), with

# Further Production of ROS via H2O2 and NO [20] Resulting

# In Necrotic Cell Death. However, Over Time Other mecha­

# Nisms Have Been Added Including Glutamate- [131,228] and

# Peroxynitrite- [14] Mediated Neurotoxicity. Thus Both

# Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species (RONS) May Be

# Involved. It Has Also Been Shown That MA, Due to Its

# Lipophilicity, Can Diffuse Through Cell Membranes Including

# Intracellular Organelles, for Example, Mitochondria, Where

# It Disrupts the Electrochemical Gradient. It is Thus Possible

# That MA Not Only Kills Neurons by the Direct Production of

# Free Radicals but Also by Triggering a mitochondrial-depen­

# Dent Induction of Apoptotic Cascades [188]. It Appears,

# Therefore, That MA Can Kill Neurons by Multiple mecha­

# Nisms Over an Extended Time Scale (Fig. 1). Therapeutic

# Intervention Should Thus Be Directed at These Mechanisms

# With Due Regard to the Time After Withdrawal.

# MA Neurotoxicity Has Been Reviewed Previously

# [9,19,110,155,175,186,187]. The Current Review Mainly

# Focuses on Recent Progress with Specific Regard To: (1)

# Laboratory Models That Reflect the Distinction Between

# Chronic Binging Versus ATD; (2) the Different Types and

# Time Course of Neurodegenerative Processes; (3) Possible

# MA-induced Mechanisms of Neurotoxicity; (4) Necrotic

# Versus Apoptotic Mechanisms; (5) Discussion of Short and

# Long-term Tolerance Versus Neurotoxic Structural Changes;

(6) potential for preventing later apoptotic cascades and

facilitating remodeling and long-term recovery and (7) issues relating to the appropriate time after withdrawal for the initiation of potential treatments.

# **2. Clinical data**

# 2.1. Abuse Patterns

# Stimulant Binging is Characterized by Frequent (every 2 h) Large Doses Over Many Days and Compulsive Repetitive MA Abuse Has B Een Described Many Times. P Reviously, and Even Now in Japan and in the U.S. Mid-West, ‘speed freaks’ Inject Compulsively (8-10 Times per day) at High Doses (0.3-1.0 g) Daily for Three to 10 Days [113,118]. The

# Shortest t1/2 of MA is 5-6 H Ranging up to 34 H [6] Dependent on Urine pH. Yet Compulsive MA Abusers Are Administering it at Short Inter-dose Durations (e.g., 2 h), Thus Near Steady-state Plasma Levels Are Quickly Reached with Modest Fluctuations. Massive Tolerance to the Lethal Effects Can Develop Since These Doses Are Five to Six Times the LD5o in a Naive User. Thus Laboratory Models That Administer MA Two or More Times a Day for a Number of Days or Continuously May Best Reflect This Clinical con­ Dition.

# There Are Two Common Scenarios for MA Overdose and Death. Often, After an Extended Abstinence, an MA Abuser Will Relapse and Take a Very High Dose, Which Had Previously Been Taken, When in a Tolerant State. Having Lost His Tolerance (hyperthermia, Hypertension, seizures) to MA During Withdrawal, This High Dose Will Be Lethal. Similarly a New Abuser Will Often Take the Same High Dose of MA That an Experienced (tolerant) Associate is Capable of Taking, Which Will Be Lethal to the Non-tolerant Individual. Death is Preceded by Uncontrollable Hyperthermia, sei­ Zures, Hypoxic Stress, and May Be Compounded by hy­ Pertensive Crises and Associated Cardiovascular complica­ Tions. This Condition is Reflected in the Common Laboratory Model of Administering ATD MA (e.g., 10 mg/kgX4 Q. 2 h).

# 2.2. Psychopathology of Withdrawal

# The Anergia Including Dysphoria and Lack of Mental Energy Associated with Withdrawal From High-dose MA Abuse is Much More Severe T Han That Seen with Cocaine and May Wax and Wane for Months After Withdrawal [57]. Psychosis is Also Common in MA Abuse and a predisposi­ Tion to Paranoia Can Last for Years, However, Psychosis May Not Have a Connection to Neurotoxicity Since Cocaine Can Induce Psychosis While Having Little, if Any, Neurotoxicity. Thus Some Long-term Functional Change, or Neurotoxicity, May Be Superimposed on the Usual Stimulant Withdrawal Characterized by a 1-3 Week Period of Anergia and Psychoasthenia.

tolerance to MA. The ‘permanent’ nature of these mono­ amine losses was shown by Woolverton et al. [225], who found a  similar dosing regimen to have reduced DA and 5-HT concentrations in the caudate 4  years after MA withdrawal. Thus early studies with non-human primates emphasized the importance of chronic MA regimens in relation to neurotoxicity. Common findings include loss of markers for DA and 5-HT function with a  relative sparing of the NE system (see [186] for a review).

# Recently, Melega Et Al. [140], Using 6-[18F]fluoro-LDOPA PET, Showed That 10 Days of an Escalating AMPH Dose (4-18 mg/kg, i.m.) Decreased DA Synthesis Capacity in Vervet Monkeys 6 Months After Treatment. More Recently the Same Group [141] Have Extended These Studies and Found a Slow Recovery (both Neurochemical and be­ havioral) From the Profound Initial Changes with Almost Complete Recovery After 2 Years. Villemagne Et Al. [211], Reported in Baboons a Dose-dependent (0.5,1 and 2 mg/kg, i.m., X4) Decrease in [uC]WIN-35,428 Binding by PET

# Scanning, a Finding Confirmed by Post-mortem Decreases in

# [ 3H]WIN-35428 And [3H]DTBZ Binding and Decreased DA and DOPAC Levels in Both the Caudate and Putamen. This

# Study Also Showed a Decrease in 5-HT and Its Primary Metabolite 5-HIAA in the Caudate and Putamen. Important­ Ly, and in Contrast to a Loss of DAT Sites (which Should Actually Inhibit Further MA Action (tolerance) and neuro­ toxicity) the Loss of vMAT, in the Terminals Allows for Increased Oxidation of Cytosolic DA and Increased Levels of Oxidative Species with Enhanced Susceptibility to Oxidative Damage [171,205,71]. More Recently Melega Et Al. [143] Has Shown Glial Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) to Be Neuroprotective Against MA-induced Loss in DAT Sites in the Vervet Monkey.

# In Summary, the Human and Non-human Primate Studies

# Show Long-term Losses in DA and 5-HT Function After Chronic MA Dosing. Future Studies May Use the vMAT, Ligand [nC]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ [111]), Which, When Compared to [18f]F-DOPA and DAT Ligands Such as Nomifensine and WIN-35,428, May Be a More Sensitive and Selective Indicator of Neurotoxic Changes and/or long­ Term Tolerance by MA. Regardless, Elucidation of the Nature of Chronically Altered Mechanisms Will Facilitate Predicting Which Potentially Therapeutic Drugs Will Be Most Effective and the Duration of Treatment Needed.

# 4.1. Early Preclinical Background

# The Early Observations by Escalante and Ellinwood [63] That Chronically Treated AMPH Cats Had Neuronal Chromatolysis and by Seiden Et Al. [185] That Rhesus Monkeys Administered Chronic High Doses of MA Had a Depletion of Caudate DA for at Least 6 Months Afterwards,

# More Sustained Dosing Models Are Needed to Reflect the

# ATD of MA (e.g., 4X10 mg/kg Q. 2 H, s.c.) in Naive

# Animals is Currently the Most Frequently Used Model in Rats

# And is Associated with Hyperthermia and Occasional sei­

# Zures and Also High Mortality. This Regimen Provides: (1)

efflux and a  reduction in rate of re-uptake as measured by voltammetry 1  week and 1  month after MA. These functional losses were much reduced by 6  months and have disappeared by 1  year after MA. The authors note that ‘the time course for recovery, 6  months to 1  year, is

# Substantially Longer Than Would Be Expected if down­ Regulation Was Entirely responsible’ and Suggest That Degenerating Axons and Terminals Are Responsible for Their Findings. A Summary of Chronic Versus ATD, Including DA Depletion and Structural Changes, is Found in Table 1.

# 4.4. Serotonergic Neurotoxicity

# The First Studies to Examine MA-induced 5-HT neuro­ Toxicity Found MA-treated (25 and 100 mg/kg/day, s.c.,

# X4 days) Rats to Have a Large Depletion of 5-HT, with Associated Loss of SERT, 3 Weeks After Treatment [172] and a Reduction in Striatal and Hippocampal Tryptophan hy­ Droxylase Activity 30 Days After ATD MA [94]. Originally it Was Thought That the Regional Specificity Seen with DA Terminals is Not Evident in the 5-HT System, with Losses Found in Many Disparate Brain Regions [172]. However Brown and Molliver [24] Have Recently Shown Selective Damage in the Caudate and Accumbens Core While, as with the DA System, 5-HT Terminals Appear to Be Spared in the Medial Shell 14 Days After MA. This Selective Toxicity May Be Related to SERT Density [24] and/or Midbrain Origin

# (DRN Or MRN [116]). ATD of MA Has Been Shown to Decrease Striatal Synaptosomal 5-HT Uptake by 50% 1 H After Treatment [68] Whereas Cocaine, Methylphenidate and Fenfluramine Were without Effect Suggesting That, as in the DA System, it is the Intracellular Actions of MA That Appear to Mediate Its Toxic Effects. Cass [35] Found ATD of MA to Reduce Evoked Efflux of 5-HT in the Striatum at 1 Week and

# 1 Month but to Be Normalized 6 Months After Treatment

# Showing That Restoration of the 5-HT System is Possible. The SERT Blockers (citalopram, Clomipramine and fluox­ etine) Have Been Shown to Be Neuroprotective [94,183] as Have DAT Inhibitors in MA-induced DA Neurotoxicity.

DAT may only partially contribute to 5-HT neurotoxicity. These data suggest, therefore, that MA-induced DA neuro­ toxicity is partially mediated by efflux of DA to the extracellular space via the DAT. An alternative model

# Suggests That Intraneuronal Oxidation is the Primary Cause of DA Terminal Neurotoxicity [45]. This View is Consistent with Cappon Et Al. [32] Who Showed That 20-day-old Rats Were Refractory to MA and Had Fewer DAT Sites and Lower Tissue DA Content. Interestingly DAT KO Showed No Increase in Temperature After ATD of MA Whereas Both Heterozygotes and Wt Showed a 2°C Elevation [70].

# To Further Examine the Question of Whether MA-induced DA Neurotoxicity is Mediated via Extraor Intracellular DA, Fumagalli Et Al. [71], Examined Heterozygous vMAT, KO (homozygotes Are Not Viable After ~1 week). It Was Again Found That ATD of MA Resulted in Decreased DA and Metabolite Levels in the Striatum of Wt, However, Heterozygotes Displayed Greater Toxicity. Interestingly it Had Previously Been Shown That Synaptosomal Uptake of DA Was the Same in Both Wt and Heterozygote Mice [72]

# Supporting the Hypothesis That Differences Found in MA Neurotoxicity in vMAT, Heterozygotes Are Linked to the vMAT2 Not the DAT. Thus Vesicular Functional Capacity is Important in the Defense Against DA Oxidation and Related Neurotoxicity.

# 5.2. nNOS Knockout is Neuroprotective

# It Has Been Shown That NMDA Receptor Activation Allows Ca2+ into the Cell, Binding of Ca2+ with Calmodulin Activates nNOS Which Produces NO and Hence perox­ Ynitrite [12]. Furthermore, Inhibition of nNOS by 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) Prevents MA-induced DA Toxicity [54,99]. Given These Findings Itzhak Et Al. [100], Examined the Effect of MA on nNOS KO Mice. After ATD of MA it Was Found That KO nNOS Mice Showed No Loss in Mazindol Binding or Decreases in DA, DOPAC and HVA, Further, These Mice Did Not Exhibit an MA-induced Hyperthermia. Interestingly, at Baseline, nNOS KO Mice Had Reduced Levels of DA That Could Be Related to the Lack of MA Neurotoxicity. Regardless, nNOS Activation Appears Crucial to MA Neurotoxicity.

# 5.3. SOD Over-expression is Neuroprotective

# A Role for ROS in MA-induced Neurotoxicity Has Been Proposed. For Example, Inhibition of SOD by Diethyldithiocarbamate Increases Neurotoxicity [50]. Subsequent­ Ly, Cadet Et Al., [29], Using Mice That Overexpress SOD Found Chronic MA to Induce No Loss of DA or DOPAC in the Striatum or Cortex of SOD Overexpressing Tg Mice When Compared to Wt. Similarly, Hirata Et Al. [90] Found These Transgenic (Tg) Mice Displayed a Six-fold Increase in

# SOD Activity and Showed Only a Small Reduction in DAT

# Binding After ATD of MA When Compared to Wt. Because

# Increased SOD is Neuroprotective Against MA it Was

# Hypothesized That the Superoxide Ion Was More Important

# Than the H2O2 or Hydroxyl Radical in MA-induced neuro­

# Toxicity (see Section on ‘MA and Oxidative stress’).

# Because MA-induced Toxicity is Attenuated in SOD-

# Overexpressing Tg Mice, Jayanthi Et Al. [102] Examined

# Whether MA Had a Differential Effect on Antioxidant

# Enzymes in These Mice. ATD of MA Caused a Decrease in

# SOD, Catalase and Glutathione Peroxidase in Both Cortical

# And Striatal Regions in Wt but an Increase in SOD and

# Catalase in Tg Mice; Furthermore Lipid Peroxidation Was

# Increased in Both Cortices and Striata in Wt but Not in Tg

# Mice. Interestingly ATD of MA Still Causes an Elevation of

# Striatal and Cortical C-fos and Zif268 in Both Groups of Mice

# [92]. This Effect Could Be by Mediated by Indirect activa­

# Tion of DA D, Receptors [147] or Glutamate Receptors [219]

# Although Manipulations That Cause Oxidative Stress in

# General Also Increase These Immediate Early Genes (IEGs

# [46,84]). The Elevations in C-fos and Zif268 Were, how­

# Ever, Attenuated in SOD Tg Mice. Nevertheless These Data

# Suggest That MA Can Activate IEGs in a superoxide-in­

# Dependent Pathway.

# 5.4. cFos Knockout Exacerbates Methamphetamine

# Although MA Has Been Shown to Induce C-fos [92] it

# Remains Unclear Whether the C-fos Induction Confers a

# Neurotoxic or Neuroprotective Effect. It Has Also Been

# Shown That Tg Mice That Overexpress SOD Showed a

# Marked Attenuation of IEG Responses [92] and AP-1

# Binding Activity [189,190]. Mice Lacking C-fos [105,218]

# Were Given ATD of MA and Killed 1 Week After Treatment.

5.5. Summary of knockout and transgenic data

# An Important Caveat with Regard to KO and Tg Mice is That They Are Not Just Different From Wt with Respect to Loss of a Particular Protein; There Are Also Numerous Unknown Compensatory Developmental Mechanisms Working. In Particular C-fos is Involved in the Regulation of Numerous Genes And, as Such, C-fos KO Mice Are Very Different From Wt in Many Ways. Regardless, DAT KO Mice Were Found to Be Refractory to MA Which Suggests That the DATmediated Neurotoxic Pathways Are Important, While the vMAT2 KO Data Suggest That Intracellular DA (oxidation) is More Important in Toxicity. However, nNOS KO Are Also Refractory to MA, Which Highlights the Importance of NMDA Receptor Activation in Neurotoxic Pathways. The SOD Overexpressing Tg Mice Highlight Oxidative mecha­ Nisms, Specifically the Superoxide and Peroxynitrite radi­ Cals. Finally, the Induction of IEGs by MA is Probably the First Stage in a Number of Neuroprotective Mechanisms.

# **6. Mechanisms of Methamphetamine neurotoxicity**

# As the Previous Section Has Shown There is an Increasing Body of Evidence That MA-induced Neurotoxicity is depen­ Dent Upon the Production of Reactive Species, Irrespective of MA’s Mode of Entry into the Neuron. There Are Three Basic Mechanisms by Which MA Administration Could Result in the Production of Such Species; (1) DA Release and Subsequent Enzymatic Oxidation, (2) DA auto-oxida­ Tion and (3) Mitochondrial Disruption. Aberrant Release of DA Can Also Induce Oxidative Stress by Excitatory Amino Acid (EAA) Excitotoxicity Through Increased Glutamate Release (Fig. 2).

# 6.1. Dopamine Oxidation

# As Already Mentioned DA and/or Its Metabolites Can Generate ROS. DA is Metabolized by MAO to DOPAC and H2O2 [198]. In Addition, DA Can Be Non-enzymatically Oxidized by Molecular O, to Form Radical Semi-ubiquinones and Superoxide Radicals [82] . C Heng [3 9] Has D emon­ Strated That Anti-oxidants Provide Neuroprotection Against DA-induced Cell Death in Cell Models. Treatment with Antioxidants, Ascorbic Acid, or Glutathione Reduces the Formation of Protein-bound Cysteinyl Cathechols, a Further Indication That DA Oxidation Products May Contribute to Toxicity [85].

# 6.2. Methamphetamine and Excitotoxicity

# Cadet and Brannock [30] Recently Reviewed the Evidence That Oxidative Stress is Involved in MA-induced Toxicity. In Addition to the Already Mentioned DA Oxidation and ROS Production, MA Administration Can Lead to Increased Extracellular Glutamate Concentration [153,154,199,228].

# The Consequent NMDA Receptor Activation Will Lead to

# Increased Production of Reactive Species [131], in Particular Through the Production of Arachidonic Acid and NO via the

# Coordinated Action of nNOS. Glutamate Receptor antago­ Nists Attenuate MA Toxicity, Inhibiting the Fall in DA

# Content and TH Activity [194,195] and Inhibiting Gliosis

# [144]. These Neuroprotective Effects May Be Related to

# Glutamate Receptor Antagonist-induced Hypothermia

# [3,4,145], Although MA Has Been Shown to Produce Hyperthermia at Low Doses [89,124,148,162,170]. In con­ Trast, Diethyldithiocarbamate Inhibition of SOD Increased Neurotoxicity [50]. There Continues to Be Compelling

# Evidence That Superoxide Radicals Are Involved in neuro­ Toxic Effects of MA.

# It is Entirely Probable That MA-induced Toxicity Occurs Through the Combined Action of Nitrosative and Oxidative

# Stresses. Perhaps Most Convincingly Both nNOS KO and

# SOD Overexpression Are Neuroprotective in Response to MA (vide supra), Implying That RONS Are Involved. In This

# Context it is Worth Noting That Selenium is a Potent Inhibitor

# Of MA-induced Neurotoxicity [96,109]. Selenium is Most

# Effective as a Scavenger of Two Electron Oxidants, Such as Peroxynitrite, and is Not Particularly Reactive Towards

# Single Electron Oxidants, Such as NO and Superoxide. Therefore, it Would Appear That MA-induced Toxicity is a Result of the Combination of These Reactive Species. Im­ Portantly, However, Reactive Species Generation is Not Merely Toxic in This Process.

# Wink and Mitchell [224] Have Described the Biology of NO as Divided into Two Categories: Direct and Indirect

# Effects. The Direct Effects, in Which NO Interacts with Biological Targets, Are Generally Rapid and Require Very Low

# Concentrations of NO, i.e. the Physiological Effects of NO. The Indirect Effects Derive From the Reaction Between NO

# And Other Oxidants to Form RONS.

# Thus at Low Flux These Reactive Molecules Can Have a Number of Physiologically Significant Roles Including tran­

# Scription Factor Regulation and Cellular Signaling [227]. At Higher Rates O F Production These Species Are Suscept Ible to a

# Variety of Cellular Defense Mechanisms Such as SOD and

# Glutathione. However, the Interaction of NO and ROS

# Generation Can Result in the Formation of Higher Oxides of Nitrogen, Which Are Potent Pathological Mediators. Most Prevalent Among Such Oxides is the Product of NO and 07, Peroxynitrite. NO and O^ Are Both Free Radicals, However, They Are Only Mild One Electron Oxidants. Due to Their Radical Nature They Recombine Rapidly, Indeed Production

# Of Peroxynitrite is Close to Diffusion Limited (the Reaction is Three-fold Faster Than the Reaction of 07 with SOD [13]). Peroxynitrite is a Potent Two-electron Oxidant as Well as Being Capable of Nitrating Biomolecules. The Balance Between Oxidation and Nitration of Target Molecules is

# Dependent Upon the Presence of CO2. Peroxynitrite Will Readily Combine with CO, to Form a Nitryl Carbonate,

which is capable of nitration but not oxidation [78]. Thus the production of peroxynitrite can result in a number of

This Reacts with Nitric Oxide (NO) to Form Peroxynitrite (ONOO ) a Highly Reactive Molecule Which Can Cause Necrotic Cell Death. There is Considerable Calcium Release Both by NMDA Receptors and Alterations in the Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore (PTP) Which Also Results in Cell Death. Thus Cell Death Can Occur by Both DAand Glutamate-mediated Pathways.

reactions including DNA strand breaks, nucleic acid modification, lipid oxidation, protein oxidation and nitra­ tion [47,108,114], which, in general, lead to necrotic cell death [79,81]. These reactions have been previously re­ viewed [80].

# When Considering the Role of Reactive Species in MAinduced Injury it is Worth Considering the Role of Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4). Within the SN BH4 Plays a Critical Role as a Cofactor to Two Major Enzymes: TH and NOS. Low Levels Lead to an Inactivity of TH, However, Within NOS There is Some Indication That a Lack of BH4 Leads Not to Inactivity but to an Alteration in Product [136,192]. NOS is Capable of Generating Both NO and ROS, Such as

# Superoxide, and the Balance Between These Products is Critically Dependent Upon the Supply of Substrate, L-arginine, and the Presence of BH4. When the Intracellular Concentration of BH4 is Low, TH Activity Will Be Inhibited, Leading to an Increase in the Concentration of Reducing Equivalents. This Increase, Combined with Low BH4 Levels, Will Result in NOS Leaking Electrons to Molecular Oxygen and Increasing the Flux of Superoxide Ions as Well as NO, That Is, a Cytotoxic State. These Proposals Are Supported by the Observation That Increased BH4 Levels Are Neuroprotec Tive to DA Neurons [115]. This Issue is Discussed Further in a Later Section on Tetrahydrobiopterin.

# 6.3. Effect of Methamphetamine on Mitochondria

# Mitochondria Have Been Implicated in Both the Necrotic and Apoptotic Cell Death Pathways with Respect to Neurodegenerative Diseases [37]. Necrosis and Apoptosis Can Occur:

# (1) Either as Distinct Conditions Alone, (2) in Combination and (3) as Sequential Events. The Necrotic Pathway is Usually Induced by More Severe Toxic Insults That Result in ATP Reserves Being Reduced Beyond a Critical Level. For Example, Excitotoxins Induce a Prolonged Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Depolarization. Often When the Insult is Sufficient There is a Depletion of Energy Reserves re­

# Sulting in Necrosis. When Glutamate-induced Excitotoxicity Occurs the Mitochondria Accumulate Ca2+ [203]. There is a Greater NOS Production of NO Following the Increase in Ca2+ After Stimulation of NMDA Receptors Versus stimula­ Tion of non-NMDA Glutamate Receptors [163].

# MA Administration Can Result in Disruption of mito­ Chondria via Both Direct and Indirect Mechanisms (Fig. 3). MA is a Cationic Lipophilic Molecule That Can Diffuse into the Mitochondria and Be Retained There. However, the Accumulation of Positively Charged Molecules in the Cristae of the Mitochondria Will Ultimately Result in Dissipation of the Electrochemical Gradient Established by the Electron Transport Chain (ETC). The Gradient is Essential to main­ Tain ATP Synthase (an Acid pH enzyme) and Also to Sustain the Integrity of the Mitochondrial Membrane [38]. Both of These Functions Are Essential for Cell Survival and a Failure in Either Result in the Initiation of Apoptotic Processes

# [125]. The Mitochondria Possess Calcium ATPase, Which

# Pumps Ca2+ into the Inner Mitochondrial Space for Storage

# Purposes. The Release of These Stores, Through the per­

# Meability Transition Pore (PTP) Will Result in Activation of

# The Cell Death Cysteine Proteases, Caspases, in Particular

# Caspase-3, Which is Normally Associated in Its Inactive Stat E

# With the Mitochondrial Envelope [150]. Another Proapop-

# Totic Factor, Which Can Be Released From Dysfunctional

# Mitochondria, is Cytochrome-c Which is an Essential cofac­

# Tor of Complex IV Within the ETC, and is Released From the

# Complex Upon Damage. Once These Factors Have Been

# Released and the Apoptotic Cascades Have Been Initiated

# They Are Essentially Irreversible (Fig. 3).

# As Previously Mentioned There Are a Number of Ways in

# Which MA Can Result in the Production of Reactive Species.

# The Mitochondrion is Itself a Source of ROS Through

# Leakage From the ETC and is Particularly Susceptible to

# Such Molecules. The Main Sites for Oxidative Attack Are the

# PTP and the Four Complexes of the ETC. The PTP is

# Readily Oxidized Which Results in Pore Opening and Ca2+

# Release. This May Be One of the Main Sites of Action of DA

# Semiquinones as the PTP is Structurally Very Close to the

# MAO Enzyme. The ETC, While Susceptible to Oxidative

# Attack, is Much More Sensitive to Nitrogen Oxides [87].

# Cytochrome C Oxidase of Complex IV is a Heme Protein

# And as Such Rapidly Combines with NO to Produce a

# Ferrous Nitrosyl Complex. Although This Combination is

# Reversible, the Iron NO Bond is Very Strong and Thus Low

# Levels of NO Can Effectively Inhibit Complex IV Function

# [42]. Indeed, Such Inhibition Has Been Proposed as a

# Mechanism for NO Control of Oxygen Consumption [120].

# Complexes I—HI Are Insensitive to NO, However, They Are

# Irreversibly Modified by Peroxynitrite Both Through oxida­

# Tion and Nitration [15]. Inhibition in This Manner is Likely to

# Be Catastrophic and Result in Mitochondrial Explosion and

# Cellular Necrosis. It is Worth Remembering That DA Neurons

# Have a Very High-energy Demand and Are Thus Particularly

# Sensitive to Mitochondrial Damage. Indeed, They Are ex­

# Tremely Sensitive to the Mitochondrial Poison, Rotenone

# [152],

# 6.4. A Putative Model of Methamphetamine-mediated

# Injury

# There Are Thus a Wide Variety of Mechanisms Whereby

# MA Administration Can Result in Neuronal Injury. However,

# Examination of These Mechanisms Leads One to a time­

# Dependent or Sequential Architectural Model of the Injury

# Pattern. Initial Insult with MA Will Result in a Necrotic

# Injury, Most Likely Mediated by Peroxynitrite, in Those

# Areas Where MA Accumulates, i.e. in Those Cells with the

# Most Abundant Capacity (DAT) to Take up MA. As a Result

# Of This Necrotic Cell Death a Number of Species Will Be

# Released into the Surrounding Interstitial Space, Including

# DA, Glutamate, Ca2+, NO, and ROS. This Will Then Induce

# A More Controlled Sequential Apoptotic Cascade in the

surrounding cells, and resistive adaptation in those cells

Fig. 3. Methamphetamine effects on mitochondria. MA enters mitochondria raising the pH of the inner membrane matrix; thus reducing the activity of the acid enzyme ATP-synthase. The capacity to maintain the mitochondrial membrane potential is thus reduced. Similarly (Fig. 2) MA inactivation of the vesicle proton (H+) pump releases DA and increases formation of DA-quinones which open the permeability transition pore (PTP). Glutamate release by MA activates NMDA receptors, which increase production of nitric oxide (NO) which inhibits complex IV activating the caspase cascade. The formation of peroxynitrite (ONOO-) from NO and superoxide (O~) inhibits complex I  and II.

that survive (most likely glial cells). Following the apoptotic phase there will be a  period of regrowth where those

# Surviving Cells Will Attempt to Repair the Injured Process; a Reactive Gliosis. In This Way it May Be That MA-induced Injury Can Be Modeled After Stroke Models of Brain Injury, Where an Initial Necrotic Site is Surrounded by an Apoptotic Penumbra and the Growth of Existing Cells into the Damaged Region [56].

# 6.5. Summary of Oxidative Mechanisms

# MA Enters the Neuron, Most Likely in a Predominantly DAT-dependent Manner and Increases Flux of RONS

# (derived From nNOS). This Increased Flux May Result From Either the Direct Effect of MA or Through Released DA. Furthermore, NMDA Receptor Activation Can Produce ROS. The Combined Stresses of Both Oxidative and Nitrosative

# Stress Result in Necrotic, Delayed, and Apoptotic Neuronal Cell Death. One Likely Molecular Mediator of This Injury Process is Peroxynitrite Formed From the Diffusion-limited Reaction of NO with Superoxide. The Production of perox­ Ynitrite Can Result in a Wide Range of Pathological modi­ Fications of Proteins, Sugars, and Lipids and Has Been Implicated in Neurological Diseases as Wide Ranging as

# Stroke and ALS.

# By Increasing the Flux of Reactive Species, MA Inhibits the Mitochondrial Electron Transport Chain Resulting in Massive Release of Ca2+ Through the PTP and the Induction of Apoptosis via the Cytochrome C, Caspase Cascade. These Cascades Are Most Likely Directly Induced by MA incorpo­ Ration into Mitochondria and Disruption of the Electron Gradient. It is Possible That Different cascades/pathologies Arise From Different MA Dosing Regimens. The Initial Necrotic Injury From MA Results in a Release of neuro­ Transmitters and Reactive Species into the Milieu, Which Will Result in Disruption of the Control of Ca2+ and Oxidative Stress in the Surrounding Area via a Variety of Processes. These Processes May Result in a Region of Apoptotic Cell Death Occurring During the Intermediate Phase and Further Long-term Effects Such as Cellular reor­ Ganization.

# **7. Methamphetamine and hyperthermia**

# 7.1. Effect of Methamphetamine on Body Temperature

# It Has Been Known for Some Time That Amphetamineinduced Hyperthermia Contributes to Lethality in Man, However, Hypertensive Cerebrovascular Hemorrhage and Cardiovascular Collapse May Also Contribute to Deaths

# [106,229]. In Rats Temperatures May Reach >40°C After Each Injection (e.g., [27,28,112,122,181]) Where hyperther­ Mia-induced Death Can Occur. Chronic MA (20 mg/kg/ dayX7 days) by Osmotic Minipumps is Also Hyperthermic for the First 2 to 3 Days, and Can Also Result in Death

# (Davidson Et Al., Unpublished observations). Indeed Most

# Researchers Now Attempt to Control Their Experimental

# animal’s Temperature by Means of Ice-baths, Cold Rooms

# Etc. in Order to (1) Reduce Hyperthermic Deaths and (2) Rule

# Out Hyperthermia as a Contributing Factor to Neurochemical

# And Other Changes. It Has Been Shown That Enhanced

# Temperatures Can Increase Oxidative Stress in Other Systems

# [130,158,193] And, in Addition to Neurodegeneration From

# Cerebrovascular Damage, May Be a Mechanism Whereby

# Hyperthermia Mediates Neurodegeneration.

# 7.2. Effect of Temperature on Indices of Dopamine

# Function and Neurotoxicity

# Bowyer and Colleagues Were the First to Specifically

# Examine the Effects of Temperature on MA-induced neuro­

# adaptations/toxicity And Their Interrelationships [16-18].

# For Example, is Has Been Reported That While 4X10 mg/kg

# MA at 4°C Evokes Greater Extracellular DA Efflux Than

# 4X5 mg/kg At 23°C, it Produces Neither Hyperthermia nor

# Loss of Caudate DA Content 3 Days After MA. Conversely,

# The Rats Treated with the Lower MA Dose at Room tempera­

# Ture Showed a 35% Loss in Caudate DA Content [17].

# Furthermore, MA-induced Hyperthermia is Associated with

# Striatal Terminal Degeneration (as Shown by Silver staining)

# Whereas Hyperthermia Alone Does Not Produce Degeneration

# [18]. There is Considerable Evidence to Suggest That the

# Degree of Changes in the DA System, or the Degree of

# Neurodegeneration, Are Correlated to the Degree of hy­

# Perthermia. For Example a Correlation Between Core Body

# Temperature and Loss of DA Uptake [181] and Between

# MA-induced Decreases in Striatal DA Concentration and

# Maximum Body Temperature [18] Have Been Shown. Inter­

# Estingly, the Temperature in the Caudate Itself Has Been

# Measured via a Thermistor in a Microdialysis Probe and Has

# Been Shown to Parallel Core Body Temperature After MA

# [41]. These Findings Suggest That Extreme MA hyperther­

# Mia is Associated with Neurodegeneration but Mild MA

# Hyperthermia May Result in Loss of DA without neurode­

# Generation.

# 7.3. Hyperthermia and NMDA Receptor Antagonists

# Antagonists of the NMDA Receptor Have Been Shown to

# Be Neuroprotective Against MA in the DA System

# [149,169,194,195,197] And May Be Related to Attenuation of

# Increased DA Efflux [156,221] Although This is Not Always

# Shown [10,66]. Glycine Receptor Antagonists Are, However,

# Ineffective [123]. Thus an Inhibition of NMDA-induced

# Increases in Extracellular DA Concentrations and NOS

# Activation (see Fig. 2) May Represent One Neuroprotective

# Mechanism. Indeed Hyperthermia Has Been Shown to

# Increase Calcium Entry into the Cell [54,201,202] Thus

# Inhibition of Calcium Entry (through the NMDA receptor)

# May Be Important. The NMDA Receptor Antagonist MK-

# 801 (dizocilpine) May Also Have Direct Hypothermic Effects,

# For Example, MK-801 Was Shown to Reduce Hypoxic

damage by lowering body temperature [25,43]. In fact,

many drugs which were originally thought to block various mechanisms associated with the action of MA have been

# Shown to Merely Induce Hypothermia [2,4,18,65]. Interest­ Ingly, the NMDA Antagonist Ketamine is Found to Be Hypothermic, Not When Given Alone, but When Given with MDMA [132]. MK-801 Also Protects Against MA-induced 5-HT Functional Loss [64,75,104,157,169] Again Consistent with NMDA-mediated Calcium and/or Temperature regula­ Tion Mechanisms of Neuroprotection.

# 7.4. Hyperthermia, NMDA Receptors and Neurotoxicity: Exceptions to the Rule?

# Hyperthermia is Certainly Involved in MA-induced Neurotoxicity and There Are a Number of Mechanisms Whereby These Effects Can Be Mediated (e.g., cerebrovascu­ Lar Damage, Increased Oxidative Stress, Increased Calcium entry). In Stark Contrast to Most Rodent Studies, However, Melega Et Al. [142] Found That MK-801 and the Resultant Hypothermia Did Not Reduce MA-induced ‘neurotoxicity’

# (decreased WIN35428 binding) in the Vervet Monkey. It

# Should Be Remembered Therefore, That Findings in One

# Species (e.g., rat) May Not Correlate Well with What is Found in Others (e.g., Mouse, monkey) and May Be Dependent Upon Differences in MA Pharmacokinetics [40]. However it Would Appear That Glutamate-mediated Actions and hy­ Perthermia Are Not Necessary for Neuroadaptations to Take Place, at Least in the Vervet Monkey. Conversely Others Have Found No Neurotoxicity in the Post-natal Day 20 Rat After 4X10 mg/kg MA Even Though Hyperthermia Was Evident [32]. More Recently it Has Been Shown That Intra-

# Striatal Injection of AMPH Can Produce Hydroxyl Radicals without Hyperthermia, and MK-801 Can Inhibit Production of These Free Radicals [217]. The Amphetamines Can, Therefore, Cause NMDA-mediated Oxidative Damage with­ Out Hyperthermia.

# **8. Analogy to Parkinson’s and other** **neurodegenerative Disease Models and putative** **treatments**

# 8.1. Similarity to Parkinson’s Disease

# MA Toxicity Like That of MPTP is Frequently Cited (e.g.,

# [196]) As a Potential Model of Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Conversely, it May Be Possible to Gain Insight into MA Pathology From PD Models. Once the First Sign of PD Has Developed, Retardation of the Progression of the Disease

# Should Be a Major Goal of Treatment Research. The Same Issue in a Different Form Applies to MA Toxicity. Should MA Bingers Be Prophylactically Treated During the Early Withdrawal and Afterwards in Order to Prevent Further Pathology? The Question of the Mechanism Responsible for the Disease Progression Falls into Two Camps: (1) DA Neuron Areas Have Marginalized Numbers of Neurons That

# Fail with the Most Severely Affected Areas Being First, and

# The Rest Following in a More Extended Sequence [138] or

# (2) Once an Insult T O One Area of DA Neurons Has Occurred,

# A Secondary Phenomenon, Such as Increased Production of

# NO in Glial Cells Continues to Cause Damage or Apoptosis,

# Not Only to the Original Cells, but Adjacent Areas. A Similar

# Extended Secondary Damage is Found in Models of Middle

# Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Which There Are Subsequent

# Penumbral Changes Surrounding the Infarct Area [56]. We

# Will Primarily Review the Hypotheses Based on the Latter

# Mechanisms.

# If Glial Cells Are Involved in the Progression Over Time

# After a Neuronal Insult, Then an in Vivo or Ex Vivo Model

# Rather Than a Cell Line is Essential. That Is, the Matrix

# Support System Around the DA Neurons Needs to Be

# Considered in Treatment Models. As One Ages, or with Toxic

# Insult, the Number of DA Neurons Decreases with a

# Concomitant Increase of Astrocytes Which Contain Higher

# Levels of MAO-B. Thus One Hypothesis is That the in­

# Creased MAO-B Relative to the DA Neurons Provides for an

# Increased Production of Oxidative Radicals.

# It Follows That Drugs Such as Deprenyl, an MAOI as Well

# As a ROS Scavenger [74] May Prevent the Secondary

# Cascades in MA Toxicity. Other Drugs That Are Utilized in

# The Treatment of PD Are Direct DA Agonists Such as

# Pramipexole, Which Also Has Antioxidant Properties [36].

# PD Post-mortem Histology Reveals SN Loss of DA Neurons

# Associated with a Massive Gliosis and the Presence of

# Active Microglial Cells [140] Following DA Neuron Injury

# Insults, Such as with MPTP. The Exaggerated SN Gliosis

# [119], Which is Reported to Be Secondary to NO Produced

# By Glial Cells, Takes Place in the Neurons of Mice in a

# Time-dependent Progression of Events [128]. These Authors

# Found That iNOS Was Involved and That iNOS KO Mice

# Reduced the Degeneration of the DA Neurons Following

# MPTP by 50%. Thus Liberatore Et Al. [128], Demonstrated

# That the Increased Production of NO Was a Delayed

# Response to MPTP, Aggravating the Original Insult Over

# Time. The Mechanism for MPTP Neurotoxic Activity is Well

# Known; it is Taken up by Glial Cells Where it is Transformed

# By MAO-B to an Active Metabolite MPP+ Which is Taken

# Up by the DA Neurons and Inhibits Complex I of the

# Mitochondrial ETC [121]. Thus a DAT Inhibitor and/or

# MAOI Could Be Useful in the Original Insult Stage of PD or

# MA Neurotoxicity. In the Original Study of Addicts Who

# Mistakenly Took MPTP, There Was a Progressive PD

# Syndrome, Evidenced by Sequential PET Studies [212]. At

# Autopsy, These Patients Also Had Numerous Active Microglial

# Cells in the SN [121]. The Mechanism by Which NO

# Induces Neurotoxicity is Under Intense Research Effort.

# Indeed, Elevated Concentrations of Nitrotyrosine Are re­

# Ported in the SN at Autopsy in PD [77]. An Additional

# Potential Mechanism Involves NO Release of Iron From the

# Intracellular Buffer Ferritin and the Induction of Oxidative

# Damage via the Fenton Reaction and Its Increase in ROS

[1,93]. Interestingly, DA fibers and DA content in the

striatum are not spared from the toxic effects of MPTP in

# iNOS KO Mice, Which Differs From That Observed in nNOS

# KO Mice [167]. Thus a Model That Examines ROS-induced Toxicity Over Time Needs to Be Used to Examine the Mechanisms Involved and Their Prevention by Drug treat­ Ments That Inhibit NO Production, as Well as Drugs That Protect DA Neurons by Other Means, Such as Reduction of MAO and by Oxidant Radical Scavenging. This is Especially True if One Considers That Considerable MA Toxicity proba­ Bly Does Not Come From Acute Overdose but by Repeated Multi-day Binges.

# As a Caveat, it Should Be Noted That Chronic MA Abusers Rarely Show an Increased Incidence of PD, but May Do as They Age, at Least the Ones That Survive Their Abuse. It

# Should Be Noted That PD Symptoms Are Only Expressed

# When -90% of DA Neurons Are Lost, Thus MA Could

# Destroy Many DA Neurons with No PD Symptomatology. Recent Studies in Detoxified MA Abusers Have, However,

# Shown Evidence for Long-term Neurotoxicity (reduced N-

# Acetylaspartate, a Neuronal marker) in the Basal Ganglia

# [62] And Reduced Metabolism [213] and DAT Binding [214]

# In the Caudate and Putamen Which is Similar to That Found

# In Atypical PD [8]. Furthermore These Patients Have Been

# Shown to Have Motor and Memory Deficits [213]. To Our Knowledge There Has Been No Long-term Follow-up of the Heavy MA Abusers of the 1960s and 1970s, This Group Represents a Population in Which We Would Most Likely Be

# Able to See PD Develop if Indeed MA Contributes to This

# Illness.

# 8.2. Antioxidants, DAT and SERT Inhibitors

# De Vito and Wagner [50,51] Originally Reported That

# Ascorbate and Vitamin E Reduced MA Neurotoxicity; Thus

# Along with the Even More Potent Selenium [97,109] Provide

# Simple Antioxidant Treatments. The Therapeutic Use of

# Uptake Blockers for DA and 5-HT Have Been Discussed

# Above and Multiple Monoamine Transport Inhibitors Are Readily Available (see Table 2).

# 8.3. Dopamine Agonists

# The Loss of Nigrostriatal DA Neurons Induced by ATD of

# MA is Substantially Blocked by Pramipexole a DA D2/3

# Agonist and Antioxidant (1 mg/kg, p.o., 1 H After the Last

# MA Dose, Plus Daily Thereafter [83]). The Fact That the

# Effects Were Observed as Early as 5 Days After MA

# Exposure Suggests That This May Be Due to a Direct Effect of

# MA at the Level of SN Neurons as Opposed to a Retrograde

# Terminal Degeneration. Casserino Et Al. [36] Reported That

# Pramipexole Reduced the Levels of ROS Produced by

# MPP + When Both Were Incubated with SH-SY5Y Cells as

# Well as When Perfused into the Striatum. Pramipexole Also

# Exhibited a Concentration-dependent Inhibition of Opening

# Of the Mitochondrial PTP Induced by Ca2+ and Phosphate,

# Or MPP + [36]. Sawada Et Al. [182] Reported That preincuba­

# Tion with D2-type DA Agonists Bromocriptine and Quin-

# Pirole Provides Neuroprotection Against Glutamate-induced

# Neurotoxicity in Cultured Rat Mesencephalic Neurons. How­

# Ever, When Bromocriptine or Quinpirole Are Only Co-ad-

# Ministered with MA They Did Not Provide Neuroprotection.

# The Protective Effects Were Dependent Upon the Duration of

# The Preincubation and Were Blocked by D2 Antagonists and

# A Protein-synthesis Inhibitor. In Addition, Preincubation

# With D 2 Agonists Provided Neuroprotection Against Toxicity

# Induced by Ca2+ Overload and Exposure to Superoxide

# Anions [182]. Thus Autoreceptor Reduction of DA Synthesis

# And Release May Substantially Reduce MA Neurotoxicity.

# 8.4. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors

# Deprenyl (selegeline), an Irreversible Inhibitor of MAO-

# B is a Frequently Used Adjunct Therapy for PD. It is Thought

# That the Desmethyldeprenyl Metabolites Are Also Associated

# With an Anti-apoptotic Action in Tissue Culture and in Animal

# Models and is Stereo-specific to the L-form [160,206]. In a

deprenyl is that following 7  days of deprenyl treatment the magnitude of the subjective euphoria produced by cocaine infusions in humans was r educed by 40% [11]. It should be noted that all of the above putative treatments may not only work at the neuronal cell body level but may also provide protection at neuronal terminal sites

# 8.5. The Dilemma of Drugs That May Have Both Toxic and Potential Protective Effects: Tetrahydrobiopterin

# BH4 Presents the Dilemma Found Not Too Infrequently with Attempts to Treat MA Abusers for the Withdrawal Anergia and Apathy but Which May Result in Increased Toxicity if They Begin to Abuse MA. Thus 6R-L-erythro5,6,7,8 Tetrahydrobiopterin (6R-BH4) (which Crosses the Blood-brain Barrier [98]) Can Augment TH in 6-OHDAlesioned Brains and Could Be Useful for the Withdrawal Apathy; yet the Synthesis-limited Release of DA by MA Would Be Augmented. Thus BH4 Presents a Potential Treatment Dilemma Which is Also Reflected in Other Potential Treatments and Underlines the Need for Interactive toxicolo­ Gy Studies with MA Before Clinical Testing. Liang and Kaufman [127], Found That Perfusion of Rat Striatal Slices with L-arginine, Which Increases NO Synthesis, Induced a Concentration-dependent Increase of DA. This Ef Fect Can Be Inhibited by SOD, Whereas Adding BH4 Induces a Massive Increase in DA Release. The Author Suggests That the Increase in DA Release by BH4 is Dependent on Its Cofactor Activity with NOS (nitric Oxide synthase) and TH. Thus BH4 is an Active Player in Normal NOS and TH augmenta­ Tion of DA Release. Since BH4 Facilitates NOS, One Might Expect That Its Activation Would Promote Neurotoxicity. However Kotsonis Et Al. [117], Found That BH4 Reacted Chemically with O2 and Enzyme-bound BH4 Was con­

# Sumed Under O2-generating Conditions in the Absence of

# Substrate [151]. DA Neurons (which Have High Levels of BH4) in Culture Are More Resistant to the Toxicity of Both Glutathione Depletion and the Treatment with Peroxides Than non-DA Neurons Regardless of Their Glutathione Peroxidase

# Status. Inhibition of BH4 Synthesis Increased Susceptibility of DA Neurons to the Toxicity of Glutathione Depletion, Whereas Increasing BH4 Levels Completely Protected nonDA Neurons Against Toxicity. All These Data Are Consistent with BH4 Serving to Control NOS Activity, in Terms of Product, i.e. Reducing the Aberrant Production of ROS, and Improving TH Function. It is Also Possible That BH4 Itself

# Serves to Operate as an Antioxidant. What is Clear is That Changes in the Intracellular Concentrations of BH4 May Contribute to Some of the Pathology Found in the Nigrostriatal System Upon MA Administration [207].

# 8.6. Potential Harm by Certain Treatments: Disulfiram

# Currently Many Avenues to Treatment of Stimulant Abuse Are Being Explored to Reduce Craving and Withdrawal

# Symptoms. Carroll Et Al. [33] and Petrakis Et Al. [164] in Double Blind Trials Have Documented That Disulfiram, as a

# Treatment for Alcohol Abuse, Decreases Cocaine Abuse and is

# Currently Being Considered as a Treatment of Combined

# Cocaine and Alcohol Abusers. Disulfiram at Low concen­

# Trations Inhibits Striatal Synaptosomal Uptake of DA as Well

# As MPP+, the Toxic Metabolite of MPTP [52], and There Are

# Other Potential Protective Actions From ROS [48,134,135].

# Despite These Positive Effects There Are Many Reports

# Indicating That Disulfiram Potentiates DA Neurotoxicity.

# Originally it Was Demonstrated That Disulfiram Markedly

# Potentiated the Effects of MA Leading to Dystonia and

# Potentiated Seizure Effects [58] and Exacerbated MA

# Depletion of DA [51]. More Recent Studies Have demon­

# Strated: (1) Competitive Inhibition at the Peripheral benzo­

# Diazepine Receptor, a Component of PTP [107]; (2) Striatal

# Glutamate Uptake Inhibition and a Decrease in Na+K+

# ATPase [133]; (3) Decreased DA Uptake and Increased

# Release From Vesicles [210]; (4) Glutathione Oxidation,

# DNA Fragmentation and Necrosis [26] and (5) Inhibition of

# SOD [51]. Thus Despite the Evidence of Protective Effects,

# The Majority of Evidence is That Disulfiram Would Aggravate

# Neurotoxicity.

# **9. Summary**

# We Suggest That Acute Toxic Models of MA Best repre­

# Sent Acute Overdose Whereas Chronic Models Represent the

# Binging Seen in Many MA Abusers. Following MA (espe­

# Cially chronic) treatment/abuse Both Short and Long-term

# Serial and Parallel Processes Occur Which Result in apop­

# Tosis (Fig. 1). Further, We Suggest That the MA-induced

# Increase in Extracellular Glutamate Promotes Pathological

# NO Synthesis with Subsequent Production of RONS Which

# Are the Primary Cause of Neurotoxicity. Potential Treatments

# Could Be Directed at Any Stage in Th Ese Pathways Dependent

# Upon Length of Abstinence. Finally it is Interesting to Note

# That MA Neurotoxicity Represents a Good Model of General

# EAA Neurotoxicity and Thus Could Be Used to Study PD,

# Stroke, Seizures and ALS.
