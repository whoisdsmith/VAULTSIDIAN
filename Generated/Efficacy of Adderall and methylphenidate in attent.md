**Abstract** Stimulant  medication  has,  for  many  years,  been  the  pharmacological  treatment  of  choice  for  children  and  adults with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  Recently,  several  studies  have  documented  the  efficacy of  a  new  stimulant,  Adderall.  Although  these  initial  studies  provide  useful  information  for  clinicians  treating ==== ADHD  children,  their  method  of  data  presentation  has  provided  limited  information  about  the  clinical ==== significance  of  drug  effects.  Thus,  to  address  the  issue  of  clinical  significance,  we  completed  drug—placebo ==== response  curve  analyses  of  a  blinded,  placebo-controlled  study  of  Adderall  and  methylphenidate  (MPH).  Our ==== results  show  that  the  efficacy  of  Adderall  and  MPH  to  improve  functioning  is  seen  throughout  the  full  range ==== of  improvement  scores.

**Introduction** Stimulant  medication  has,  for  many  years,  been  the pharmacological  treatment  of  choice  for  children  and adults  with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD)  (Biederman  et  al.,  1997).  Recently,  several  studies have  documented  the  efficacy  of  a  new  stimulant, Adderall,  which  consists  of 25  %  L-amphetamine  and  75  % D-amphetamine  in  four  salts  (Manos  et  al.,  1999;  Pelham et  al.,  1999a,b;  Pliszka  et  al.,  2000;  Swanson  et  al.,  1998). Pharmacodynamic  studies  suggest  that  Adderall  has  a longer  duration  of  action  than  methylphenidate  (MPH) (Swanson  et  al.,  1998).  Because  MPH  is  currently  the  most widely  prescribed  medication  for  ADHD,  several  studies have examined the comparative efficacy of Adderall and

Using  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  cross-over 

design,  Pelham  et  al.  (1999a)  compared  two  doses  of 

Adderall  with  two  doses  of  MPH.  Compared  with 

placebo,  both  drugs  led  to  substantial  improvements  in

action,  it  was  more  effective  than  MPH  for  outcomes

Adderall  by  a  3:1  margin.  Another  study  by  the  same

placebo  in  reducing  parent-  and  teacher-reported  symp­ toms  of  ADHD.  This  group  also  reported  that  a  single dose  of  Adderall  was  as  effective  as  two  daily  doses  of MPH.

Pliszka  et  al.  (2000)  reported  a  double-blind,  placebocontrolled  parallel  group  comparison  of  Adderall  and MPH.  Consistent  with  prior  studies,  both  medications were  superior  to  placebo  in  improving  parent,  teacher  and clinician  ratings  of  ADHD  and  associated  behaviours. 

Compared  with  MPH,  Adderall  led  to  significantly  more improvements  in  teacher  and  clinician  ratings.  Adderalltreated  subjects  were  nearly  five  times  more  likely  than MPH-treated  subjects  to  be  adequately  treated  with  a 

single daily dose.

Taken  together,  these  prior  studies  clearly  show Adderall  to  be  superior  to  placebo.  They  further  suggest Adderall  is  at  least  as  effective  as  MPH  and  may  be  more effective  for  some  outcomes.  Although  these  initial  studies provide  useful  information  for  clinicians  treating  ADHD children,  their  method  of  data  presentation  has  provided limited  information  about  the  clinical  significance  of  drug effects.  We  initially  addressed  the  issue  of  clinical 

significance  by  completing  drug—placebo  response  curve ==== analyses  of  the  data  of  Pliszka  et  al.  (2000).  This  method, ==== described  by  Faraone  et  al.  (2000),  is  a  generalization  of ==== receiver  operating  characteristic  (ROC)  analysis  (McNeil ==== and  Hanley,  1984),  which  has  been  widely  applied  to ==== assessing  the  accuracy  of  diagnostic  tests  (Siegel  et  al., ====

1989,  1990;  Swets  and  Pickett,  1982).  The  goal  of  this ==== method  is  to  answer  the  following  questions  about drug—placebo  or  drug—drug  differences  that  have  already been  shown  to  be  statistically  significant:  Is  the  effect clinically  meaningful?  What  does  the  effect  tell  us  about individual  responses?  Is  the  effect  due  to  symptom improvement, the prevention of worsening or both?

A  re-analysis  of  the  data  of  Pliszka  et  al.  (2000)  using drug—placebo  response  curve  methodology  showed  that the  ability  of  Adderall  to  improve  functioning  is  seen throughout  the  full  range  of  improvement  scores  (Faraone et  al.,  2001).  In  contrast,  MPH  showed  a  substantial  effect for  'mildly'  and  'much  improved'  but  not  for  'very  much improved'.  These  analyses  also  show  that  both  Adderall and  MPH  prevented  worsening  of  symptoms,  an  effect usually  obscured  by  standard  analyses.  The  present  report extends  this  prior  work  by  applying  drug—placebo response  curve  methodology  to  the  data  reported  by Manos et al. (1999).

**Methods** **Subjects** This  sample  is  a  subset  of  a  clinic-based  population referred for diagnosis and treatment of ADHD to the

Paediatric  Assessment  and  Evaluation  Service  (PAES)  of  a 

large,  urban,  teaching  hospital.  As  a  result  of  the  hospital 

infrastructure,  the  system  caters  for  managed  care  patients 

not  requiring  immediate  intervention.  Of  the  600  patients 

referred  for  evaluation  to  date,  159  have  participated  in  a 

medication  trial.  One  hundred  and  seventeen  of  the 

subjects  receiving  medication  were  administered  MPH 

(n  =  117),  with  42  administered  Adderall (n  =  42).  The 

study  was  approved  by  the  local  Institutional  Review 

Board.

**Diagnoses**

All  children  diagnosed  with  ADHD  met  full  DSM-IV 

diagnostic  criteria  for  this  disorder.  The  criteria  are  (1)  the 

presence  of  at  least  six  symptoms  for  inattention  and/or 

at  least  six  symptoms  for  hyperactivity/impulsivity;  (2) 

symptoms  significantly  interfered  with  functioning  at 

home  and  at  school  as  noted  during  structured  or  semi­

structured  clinical  interviews  with  the  Computerized 

Diagnostic  Interview  for  Children  (CDISC);  (3)  symptom 

severity  on  broad-band  [i.e.  Conners'  Abbreviated  Symp­====

toms  Questionnaire  (Conners,  1969)]  and  narrow-band ====

[e.g.  ADHD  Rating  Scale  (DuPaul,  1991)]  rating  scales ====

was  at  threshold  or  above  (i.e.  rated  2  or  3);  (4)  multiple ====

raters  (e.g.  parents  and  teachers)  agreed  to  the  presence  of ====

the  symptoms;  and  (5)  empirical  comparison  to  norms ====

indicated  at  least  a  1.5 ====s======.====d==.  cut-off  on  at  least  one  rating ====

scale.  It  should  be  noted  that  in  identifying  the  presence  of 

symptoms,  behaviours  across  informants  were  not  pooled 

observations.  Behaviours  were  only  considered  significant 

if  two  informants  agreed  to  the  presence  of  the  symptom 

on rating scales or in interviews.

**Design**

Matching procedures

MPH  and  Adderall  protocols  were  run  simultaneously, 

with  medication  assigned  to  subjects  based  on  physicians' 

discretion  and  familiarity  with  the  medication.  The  42 

patients  who  received  Adderall  exhausted  our  sample  of 

children  given  this  medication.  We  selected  42  subjects 

from  the  MPH  group (n  =  117)  who  were  approximately 

the  same  age  (+  6  months),  and  were  the  same  gender  as 

those  enrolled  in  the  Adderall  group.  As  described  by 

Manos  et  al.  (1999),  the  sample  was  predominantly 

Caucasian,  well  educated  and  without  significant  comor-

bid  disorders.  Sixty  percent  were  older  than  9  yr,  and 

79  %  were  male  and  55  %  had  combined-type  ADHD;  the 

remainder  had  inattentive  type.  The  MPH  and  Adderall 

groups did not differ in clinical or demographic features.

Efficacy of Adderall and methylphenidate in ADHD 123

Pharmacological protocol All  subjects  in  this  study  were  evaluated  using  a  4-wk double-blind,  placebo-controlled  protocol.  Each  child's paediatrician  determined  whether  MPH  or  Adderall  was to  be  used.  Type  of  medication  administered  was  based  on physicians'  familiarity  with  the  agent  (i.e.  often  related  to the  number  of  times  they  had  previously  prescribed  the medication),  as  well  as  whether  they  wanted  a  child  to receive  a  single  dose  (Adderall)  or  twice-daily  dose (MPH)  of  medication  for  treatment  of  ADHD.  This  latter decision  was  usually  based  on  a  parent's  concern  about the  child  taking  medication  in  school.  Fifteen  of  the Adderall  subjects  had  previously  used  MPH  but  were discontinued  due  to  failure  to  respond  (n  =  7)  or  negative side-effects  („  =  8).  None  of  the  MPH  patients  had  a  prior history of using Adderall. Subjects  received  each  of  four  MPH  (twice-daily) or Adderall  (four  times  daily)  dosing  schedules  in  a  randomly assigned  sequence.  Each  of  the  four  doses  was  admini­ stered  for  a  7-d  period.  Medication  was  initiated  the  day after  the  baseline  assessment.  The  four  stimulant  drug conditions  were  as  follows:  A======p==  placebo;  B======p== ======5==  mg ==== Adderall  or  10  mg  MPH  (low  total  daily  dose);  B======2==, ==== 10  mg  Adderall  or  20  mg  MPH  (moderate  total  daily ==== dose);  B======3==,  15  mg  Adderall  or  30  mg  MPH  (high  total ==== daily  dose).  Six  dose  orders  were  used  such  that  the ==== highest  dose  (15  mg  Adderall)  was  given  only  when ==== preceded  by  the  moderate  dose  (10  mg  Adderall).  Dose ==== orders  were  assigned  to  subjects  in  a  random  fashion.  The ==== possible dose orders were the following: **Al“Bl“B2“B3** **Al“B2~B3“B1** **Bl—B2—B3—A1** **Bl—Al—B2_B3** **B2-B3~A1-B1** **B2—B3—Bl—A1** Fixed  doses  (vs.  mg/kg)  were  prescribed  because  they reflect  typical  paediatric  practice  and  because  MPH dosage  has  been  shown  to  be  independent  of  body weight  (Rapport  et  al.,  1989a,b).  Also,  fixed  doses  provide increased  flexibility  in  comparing  data  sets  with  previous studies,  providing  more  information  about  ADHD  chil­ dren's  response  to  stimulants.  All  MPH,  Adderall  and placebo  dosings  were  prepared  by  licensed  pharmacists and  packaged  in  white  gelatin  capsules  to  avoid  detection of  placebo  or  active  medicine  by  taste.  Capsules  were sealed  in  individual  bottles  dated  by  week  to  control  for accurate  dose  administration.  Parents  were  given  one bottle  of  capsules  every  week  and  were  asked  to  return bottles  at  the  end  of  the  week  with  unused  capsules  to insure  compliance  with  the  protocol.  MPH  capsules  were given  in  the  morning  (08:00  hours)  and  at  noon  each  day. Adderall  capsules  were  administered  in  the  morning  only. While  both  the  clinician  and  parent  knew  to  which medication  condition  each  child  had  been  assigned,  the 

clinician,  teacher,  and  parent  were  blind  to  the  weekly dose administered.

Outcome measures For  all  of  the  following  outcome  measures,  we  analysed the  outcome  reported  for  the  'best  dose'  of  each medication.  Best  dose  was  assigned  by  the  consensus  of  a clinical  child  psychologist  and  a  board-certified  child  and adolescent  psychiatrist  prior  to  the  medication  blind being broken.

ADHD Rating Scale (ARS) The  ADHD  Rating  Scale  (DSM-III-R  and  DSM-IV versions)  (DuPaul,  1991,  and  unpublished  observations) comprises  items  assessing  the  symptoms  of  the  ADHD diagnostic  category.  For  this  study,  items  on  the  DSM-IIIR  version  were  revised  to  reflect  the  new  symptom criteria  of  the  DSM-IV.  The  severity  of  symptoms  is  rated on  a  problem  scale  of  '0  =  not  at  all'  to  '3  =  very  much'. The  sum  of  items  scored  2  or  higher  determines  whether a  child  meets  the  formal  d==iagn==ostic  criteria  for  ADHD. The  ARS  has  been  shown  to  ==di==scriminate  ADHD  children from  learning  disabled  childr==en  ==and  non-learning  disabled children,  to  differentiate  ==chil==dren  with  hyperactivity from  children  without,  and  to == b==e  sensitive  to  stimulant drug effects (Bar==kley== et al., 1990).

The Abbreviated Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ) The  ASQ  is  a  parent  and  teacher  rating  form  (Conners, 

1969).  The  10-item  rating  scale  is  similar  to  the  ARS  in format.  That  is,  parents  and  teachers  rate  children's 

symptoms  on  a  scale  of  0—3,  with  0  indicating  that  the 

symptom  is  not  present  at  all  and  3  indicating  that  the 

symptom  is  very  much  present.  The  ASQ  is  considered  to be  the  gold-standard  of  rating  scales  and  was  included  for validation purposes.

Composite ratings Based  on  parental  report  of  weekly  behaviour  problems, the  primary  clinician  rated  the  child's  behaviour  at  the  end of  each  week  on  a  scale  of  —  5  (significant  deterioration) to  +5  (significant  improvement).  These  weekly  com­ posite ratings  reflected both  clinicians' (M.  J. M.  and R.  L. F.) 

summary  based  on  a  review  of  standardized  data,  parental report, and anecdotal data.

and  concentration  at  school.  Respondents  first  rate whether  a  child  has  problems  in  a  given  situation,  then rate  the  severity  of  that  problem  from  '  1  =  mild'  to  '9  = 

severe'.  The  scale  has  adequate  test—retest  reliability  and correlates  highly  with  other  teacher  ratings  scales  of ADHD  symptomatology.  The  SSQ—R  has  been  found  to be  sensitive  to  the  effects  of  stimulant  medication interventions  (Barkley,  1990)  and  to  discriminate  ADHD from  non-AD  HD  children  (Barkley,  1990).  'Part  scores' used  in  analyses  excluded  items  for  which  teacher  ratings were  consistently  unavailable  (e.g.  'during  movies',  'film-

strips', 'on field trips').

Drug—placebo and drug—drug response curve analysis The  rationale  and  methodology  for  the  method  are described  in  detail  by  Faraone  et  al.  (2000).  The  goal  of response  curve  analysis  is  not  to  demonstrate  statistically 

significant  group  differences.  Instead,  this  method  pro­ vides  a  means  of  displaying  differences  already  demon­

strated  to  be  statistically  significant.  Thus,  it  does  not replace  a  standard  statistical  analysis  but  augments  that ==== analysis  by  showing  the  clinical  significance  of  drug ==== effects.====

There  are  six  steps  in  drawing  the  curve:  (1)  choose  an ==== outcome  variable;  (2)  for  the  drug  and  placebo  groups ====

separately,  calculate  for  each  observed  score  the  pro­==== portion  of  subjects  having  that  score  or  a  better  score;  (3) ==== for  each  observed  score,  plot  the  proportions  computed  in item  (2)  for  the  drug  group  on  the  vertical  axis  against  the proportions  computed  for  the  placebo  group  on  the horizontal  axis;  (4)  connect  the  plotted  points  and  label those  that  correspond  to  the  best  response,  the  25th percentile  of  response,  the  median  response,  the  75th percentile  of  response  and  the  worst  response;  and  then 

(5)  plot  the  line  of  no  effect.  This  is  the  diagonal  line  from the  [0,  0]  point  to  the  [I,  I]  point.  The  line  of  no  effect comprises  all  points  for  which  the  proportion  of  subjects who  respond  to  drug  is  the  same  as  the  proportion  who respond to placebo.

The  drug—placebo  response  curve  is  a  graphical  method of  describing  results  from  a  clinical  trial,  not  a  statistical test.  It  is  most  sensibly  used  to  describe  an  effect  that  has been  demonstrated  with  appropriate  statistical  tools. Nevertheless,  the  drug—placebo  response  curve's  roots  in ROC  analysis  motivates  the  computation  of  one  statistic, the  area  under  the  curve  (AUC).  The  AUC  ranges  from 0.5  (when  the  drug  effect  equals  the  placebo  effect)  to  1.0. The  AUC  is  a  useful  index  of  clinical  significance  because it  equals  the  probability  that  a  randomly  selected  member of  the  drug  group  will  have  a  better  result  than  a randomly  selected  member  of  the  placebo  group  (Colditz 

et  al.,  1988;  Hanley  and  McNeil,  1982),  i.e.  the  probability 

that drug will outperform placebo.

Although  the  drug—placebo  response  curve  was  orig­

inally  developed  to  assess  drug—placebo  differences,  it  can 

also  be  used  to  compare  two  active  drugs  by  creating  a 

drug—drug  response  curve.  The  only  difference  in  this 

drug—drug  response  curve  is  that  the  vertical  axis 

corresponds  to  the  superior  drug  and  the  horizontal  axis 

corresponds to the other drug.

**Results**

In  the  original  analyses  reported  by  Manos  et  al.  (1999), 

all  of  the  rating-scale  measures  showed  statistically 

significant  drug—placebo  differences  for  both  Adderall 

and  MPH.  There  were  not  statistically  significant  differ­

ences between Adderall and MPH. Thus, we created

**Teacher report data** Figures  1  and  2  show  the  results  for  the  teacher  report data.  Figure  l(a,  b)  shows  the  results  for  the  School Situations  Questionnaire  (SSQ)  for  Adderall  and  MPH, respectively.  Small  values  correspond  to  better  outcome. For  all  possible  definitions  of'  good  response'  (i.e.  different SSQ  cutting  scores),  each  point  on  the  curve  shows  the results  of  two  calculations:  the  rate  of  response  to  drug and  the  rate  of  response  to  placebo.  First  consider  the point  labelled  0  in  Figure  la.  This  tells  us  the  rates  of  drug and  placebo  response  when  we  define  a  positive  outcome as an SSQ score of 0 (no symptoms). For this point, we

read  from  the  horizontal  axis  that  the  rate  of  response  is 

11%  for  the  placebo  group;  from  the  vertical  axis  we  see 

that  the  response  rate  was  30%  for  the  drug  group. 

Sequential  points  further  up  the  curve  specify  increasingly 

lenient  thresholds  for  defining  improvement.  Thus,  they 

show  how  the  drug  and  placebo  response  rates  change  as 

we  incrementally  change  the  cutting  score  used  to  define 

improvement.  For  example,  the  next  labelled  point  on  the 

curve  (labelled  0.6)  represents  the  rates  of  response  (to 

drug and  placebo) when  change is  defined as  an SSQ  score 

of  0.6  or  less.  This  point  tells  us  that  40  %  of  the  Adderall 

group,  but  only  18%  of  the  placebo  group,  showed  this 

degree of improvement.

On  these  curves,  five  points  are  labelled:  the  minimum, 

the  25th  percentile,  the  median,  the  75th  percentile,  and 

the maximum. For example, in Figure la we can see that

the  median  score  achieved  was  3.2.  The  coordinates  of this  point  (Adderall,  0.68;  placebo,  0.41)  tell  us  that  68% of  Adderall  patients  achieved  this  level  of  improvement  or better  compared  with  41  %  of  placebo  patients.  Knowing that  the  25th  percentile  is  0.6  tells  us  that  25  %  of  subjects had  a  score  of  0.6  or  better  and  that  25  %  scored  between 0.6  and  3.2  (the  median).  Thus,  the  labelled  points  give  us a  rough  idea  of  how  the  outcome  scores  are  spread  out among subjects. The  size  of  the  drug  effect  is  displayed  by  the  degree  to which  the  drug—placebo  response  curve  rises  above  the line  of  no  effect.  If  outcome  on  drug  were  worse  than outcome  on  placebo,  then  the  drug—placebo  response curve  would  fall  below  the  line  of  no  effect.  As  Figure  I shows,  for  both  Adderall  and  MPH,  the  drug—placebo response  curve  is  always  above  the  diagonal  Tine  of  no 

effect'.  This  shows  that  both  drugs  outperform  placebo for all possible definitions of 'good response'.

A  brief  inspection  of  Figure  I(a,  b)  shows  that  the curves  from  Adderall  and  MPH  are  very  similar.  Both  rise above  the  diagonal  line  to  the  same  degree  and  both  have 

similar  labels  for  the  five  labelled  points.  The  AUC 

statistics  for  these  two  curves  were  0.67  and  0.66.  These 

show  that  Adderall  and  MPH  outperform  placebo  67  and 66% of the time, respectively.

Figure  2  shows  results  for  teacher  ratings  on  the  ASQ. Because  the  Adderall  curve  (Figure  2a)  is  somewhat higher  than  the  MPH  curve  (Figure  2b),  the  AUC  for Adderall  (0.72)  is  greater  than  that  for  MPH  (0.64).  But this  difference  was  not  statistically  significant  in  the original report (Manos et al., 1999).

**Parent report data** Figures  3  and  4  present  results  for  parent  report  data. From  Figure  3(a,  b)  we  see  that  parent  ratings  on  the  ASQ 

show  that  both  drugs  are  superior  to  placebo  and  that each  has  a  similar  effect.  The  AUCs  for  Adderall  and  MPH ==== were  0.73  and  0.77,  respect==ivel==y.  Comparing  the  parent ASQ  ratings  in  Figure  3(a,  ==b)==  with  the  teacher  ASQ ratings  in  Figure  2(a,  b)  sho==ws  ==a  very  similar  pattern  of results  for  the  parent  and  t==each==er  ratings.  Both  sets  of curves  rise  above  the  diagon==al  ==by  about  the  same  amount and  both  show  a  similar  dist==ribu==tion  of  scores.  The  only 

slight  difference  is  in  the  lower  minimum  scores  for  the ==== parent  ratings  (Adderall,  34  vs.  40;  MPH,  35  vs.  40).  This 

suggests  that  parents  are  more  likely  to  report  lower 

symptom levels than teachers.

The  parent  ratings  on  the  ADHD  rating  scale  (Figure  4) are  consistent  with  the  other  parent  and  teacher  ratings  in 

showing  a  similar  pattern  of  results  for  Adderall  and MPH. The AUCs were 0.72 for both Adderall and MPH.

**Composite ratings** Figure  5  shows  results  for  clinician  composite  ratings of  the  parent-reported  data.  This  scale  ranges  from  —5 

(significant  deterioration)  to  +5  (significant  improve­ ment).  We  again  see  that  the  curves  are  very  similar  for Adderall  and  MPH.  The  AUCs  were  0.86  and  0.89, respectively.  The  curves  in  Figure  5  are  especially interesting  because  they  provide  information  about whether  or  not  the  drugs  prevent  worsening.  A  composite 

score  of  0  indicates  no  change.  In  Figure  5a,  by  examining the  graph  axes  corresponding  to  the  point  labelled  'O',  we 

see  that  100%  of  Adderall  subjects  had  a  score  of  0  or better,  i.e.  no  Adderall  patients  worsened.  In  contrast, only 89% of placebo subjects had a score of 0 or more.

Probability of placebo response

Efficacy of Adderall and methylphenidate in ADHD 127

Probability of placebo response **Figure 5.** Composite rating. Based on parental report of weekly behaviour problems, the primary clinician rated the child's behaviour at the end of each week on a scale of — 5 (significant deterioration) to + 5 (significant improvement).

which  indicates  that  11%  worsened.  Likewise,  in  Figure 5b  we  see  that  no  MPH  patients  worsened  but  16%  of placebo  patients  did.  Thus,  the  response  curves  makes  it clear  that  Adderall  and  MPH  not  only  improve  function­ ing, they also prevent worsening.

**Discussion** We  have  extended  the  statistical  results  of  Manos  et  al. (1999)  by  using  drug—placebo  response  curves  to  describe the  clinical  significance  of  the  efficacy  of  Adderall  and MPH  in  the  treatment  of  ADHD.  Our  presentation provides  readers  with  a  means  of  understanding  the nature  of  drug  effects  and  the  degree  to  which  they  are clinically  relevant.  Instead  of  collapsing  individual  re­ sponses  into  means  or  single  rates  of  response,  the 

drug—placebo  response  curve  shows  the  ability  of  each drug  to  improve  outcome  and  limit  worsening  throughout the  full  range  of  outcome  scores.  These  clinically  relevant details are lost in a standard analysis.

Visual  comparison  of  panels  (a)  and  (b)  in  Figures  1—5 

suggests  that  Adderall  and  MPH  have  equivalent  efficacy, which  is  consistent  with  the  finding  of  no  statistical differences  in  the  original  report  of  Manos  et  al.  (1999)  on these  data.  Our  analyses  showed  that  both  Adderall  and MPH  prevent  worsening  of  symptoms.  For  example,  in Figure  5,  the  0  point  on  the  composite  rating  scale  is  the point  of  no  change.  For  both  Adderall  and  MPH,  the probability  of  'no  change  or  better'  was  1.0.  This  means that  no  patients  worsened  on  either  drug.  In  contrast,  for the  placebo  groups,  the  probability  of  'no  change  or better'  was  about  0.85,  meaning  that  15%  of  patients worsen  on  placebo.  From  a  clinical  perspective,  the worsening  which  occurs  on  placebo  is  important  in­ formation  which  is  not  typically  stressed  or  even mentioned  in  most  published  clinical  trials.  Knowledge  of the  risk  of  worsening  without  medication  treatment  is essential  for  clinicians  to  correctly  communicate  to patients  and  parents  of  patien==ts  ==the  risks  and  benefits  of 

stimulant therapy.====

The  value  of  drug—placebo  response  curve  methods  for ==== rating  scale  data  can  be  seen  in  Figures  2  and  3,  which ====

show  ASQ  results  for  teachers  (Figure  2)  and  parents ====

(Figure  3).  These  are  presented  as ======t==  scores,  which  have  a ==== mean  of  50  and  standard  deviation  of  10.  Scores  of  65  or ==== more  are  usually  considered  to  be  of  clinical  concern. Because  the  drug—placebo  response  curve  shows  the entire  distribution  of  scores,  it  provides  useful  facts  about the  distribution  of  response  in  drug  and  placebo  groups. For  example,  in  Figure  2a  we  see  that  from  the  point labelled  66,  90  %  of  Adderall-treated  patients  have  scores less  than  66  and  are  thus  out  of  the  clinically  serious  range. 

Only  68%  of  placebo  subjects  make  an  equal  improve­ ment.  In  addition  to  confirming  the  effect  of  Adderall  at this  clinical  threshold,  it  also  shows  that  10%  of  Adderalltreated  patients  remain  in  the  clinically  serious  range, which  emphasizes  the  need  for  alternative  treatments. Inspection of the MPH graphs lead to similar conclusions.

These  two  graphs  also  provide  important  information about  the  drugs'  ability  to  lead  to  high  levels  of functioning.  For  example,  patients  with t  scores  of  50  or lower  function  as  well  as  the  best  half  of  the  general population.  In  Figure  3a  we  see  that  approx.  70%  of Adderall-treated  patients  achieved  this  threshold  com­ pared  with  35%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  Similar findings  are  seen  for  MPH.  Both  sets  of  graphs  show  that 

some  placebo-treated  patients  do  extremely  well.  Al­ though  we  do  not  know  if  such  placebo  improvement would  be  long  lasting,  the  finding  of  excellent  placebo

response  in  a  small  subgroup  should  motivate  research into the predictors of medication response.

As  described  by  Faraone et  al.  (2000),  the  drug—placebo response  curve  might  also  generate  psychometric  hy­ potheses  about  drug—placebo  differences.  In  this  regard, the  most  notable  difference  among  measures  was  the greater  effect  for  the  composite  rating  compared  with  the other  ratings.  Visually,  we  easily  see  this  in  the  greater bowing-out  of  the  curves  in  Figure 5  compared  with  the other  figures.  This  difference  leads  to  two  psychometric hypotheses.  Clinicians  made  the  ratings  based  on  a  review of  the  standardized  data,  parental  report  and  anecdotal data.  Thus,  one  possibility  is  that  the  clinician  rating  may be  more  sensitive  to  drug  effects  because  several  sources of  information  were  used  and  the  information  was evaluated  by  an  expert.  It  is  also  possible  that  the composite  rating  may  be  more  sensitive  to  improvements at  the  well  end  of  the  spectrum  of  functioning.  This  makes sense  because  the  rating  scales  measure  change  within  the range  of  pathology  (i.e.  reduction  of  symptoms)  whereas the  composite  rating  can  be  sensitive  to  non-symptomatic functional improvements.

This  work  must  be  considered  in  the  context  of  its ==== methodological  limitations.  Adderall  and  MPH  were ==== assigned  by  physician's  choice.  This  non-random  assign­==== ment  may  have  affected  the  findings  in  unknown  ways. ==== Another  limitation  is  the  use  of  a  clinic-based  sample  that ==== caters  for  primarily  middle-class  families.  That  will  limit ==== the  generalizability  of  our  findings.  Also,  the  use  of  a  fixed ==== dose  design  may  not  optimally  model  the  clinical administration  of  these  medications.  We  must  also consider  several  threats  to  the  internal  validity  of  the study,  which  may  have  compromised  our  results.  These include  regression  towards  the  mean,  test  sensitization, and  demand  characteristics.  Because  of  these  threats,  we must  be  cautious  in  the  interpretation  of  our  results. Despite  these  limitations,  our  results  clarify  the  clinical significance  of  each  medication's  efficacy  when  compared with  placebo.  Both  drugs  prevent  worsening  and,  for  a majority  of  patients,  lead  to  improvements  that  are  well into the normal range.
