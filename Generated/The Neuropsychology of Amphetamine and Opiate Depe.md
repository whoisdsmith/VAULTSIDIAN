**Abstract** Chronic use of amphetamines and/or opiates has been associated with a  wide range of cognitive deficits,

## Involving Domains of Attention, Inhibitory Control, Planning,

### Decision-making, Learning and Memory. Although Both

### Amphetamine and Opiate Users Show Marked Impairment in Various Aspects of Cognitive Function, the Impairment Profile

### Is Distinctly Different According to the Substance of Abuse. In

### Light of Evidence Showing That Cognitive Impairment in Drug Users Has a Negative Impact on Treatment Engagement and

### Efficacy, We Review Substance-specific Deficits on Executive

### And Memory Function, and Discuss Possibilities to Address These During Treatment Intervention.

logical Test Automated Battery (CANTAB; http://www. ==cam==cog.com==)== ====have facilitated research into cognitive impairments associated with drug dependence, and allowed comparisons to be drawn with cognitive profiles observed in other clinical populations. The development of para­ digms capable of being applied in both animals and in humans has opened up new avenues, as drug users’ behavior observed clinically can be modelled in animals, and findings in animals treated experimentally with drugs could be directly tested in humans (Robbins et al. 1994). Neuroimaging research such as functional magnetic reso­ nance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have provided vital insight into the neural substrates and neurochemical processes subserving cognition and have shed light on disrupted neural network in chronic drug users (London et al. 2000; Volkow et al. 2004a).

### Comparisons of the Cognitive Profiles Associated with the Psychostimulants and Narcotics is Particularly interest­ Ing with Regard to the Different Pharmacological Actions and the Distinct Mechanisms of Positive and Negative reinforce­ Ment Implicated in the Development of Amphetamine and Opiate Dependence. This Article Will Provide a Concise Overview of the Neuropathology Associated with Chronic Amphetamine and Opiate Use, Review the Cognitive Systems and Their Dysregulation by Amphetamine and Opiates, and Will Discuss Possibilities of How Cognitive Deficits Could Be Addressed in Drug Treatment.

### **Neuropathology Associated with Chronic Amph etamine**

## **and Opiate Use**

## Amphetamines and Opiates Are Widely Used (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 2003a), and Both Activate the Dopamine System in the Midbrain, Which is Associated with Positive Reinforcing Effects, and Therefore, Have Addictive Potential (Di Chiara and Imperato 1986). However, the Pharmacological Actions of Both Substances Can Be differen­ Tiated. The Acute Pharmacological Effects of Amphetamines Are to Increase Central Monoamine Neurotransmission by Interaction with Processes of Transmitter Release, Uptake, and Metabolism (Seiden Et Al. 1993, for review). Opiates, by Contrast, Exert Action Mainly Through P-opioid Receptors, Indirectly Increasing Dopamine but Decreasing Noradrenaline Levels (De Vries and Shippenberg 2002; Maldonado 1997). In View of the Distinct Pharmacological Actions and Reinforcement Mechanisms Implicated in Amphetamine and Opiate Use (Bardo 1998, for review), the Neuropathology in Chronic Users May Be Different.

### Growing Evidence Suggests That Chronic Amphetamine Use Results in Long-lasting Changes in Dopamine Neurotransmission, a Neurotransmitter System Critically Implicated in Motor, Reward and Cognitive Functions, Thereby Contributing

Springer

### To a Wide Range of Behavior Patterns (Cools and Robbins

### ====2004; ====Nieoullon ====2002; ====Robbins ====2005). ====Converging evi­

### Dence From Animal and Human Research Indicates Marked

### Dopaminergic Dysfunction as Reflected by Down-regulation

### Of Dopamine DI and D2 Receptors, Glucose Metabolism

### (London Et Al. 2004; Volkow Et Al. 2001c; Wang Et Al.

### 2004), And Perfusion (see for Review Baicy and London

### 2007; Volkow Et Al. 2004b). Neuroimaging Studies Using

### Structural MRI Have Provided Further Evidence That abnor­

### Malities Associated with Chronic Amphetamine Exposure Are

### Not Only Functional but Also of a Morphological Nature.

### Profound Reductions in Gray Matter Have Been Identified in

### The Cingulate, Limbic, and Paralimbic Cortices and the

### Inferior Frontal Gyrus (Thompson Et Al. 2004), While Striatal

### Volume is Significantly Increased (Chang Et Al. 2005;

### Jemigan Et Al. 2005). Although the Neurotoxicity of

### Amphetamines in Humans is Still a Matter of Debate, Drug-

### Induced Changes in the Dopamine System May Be dose­

### Dependent (Sung Et Al. 2007) and Be Long-lasting (Johanson

### Et Al. 2006; McCann Et Al. 1998; Sekine Et Al. 2001; Volkow

### Et Al. 2001b). Yet, There is Converging Evidence From Studies

### Investigating Brain Glucose Metabolism, Brain Metabolites,

### And Dopamine Transporter Density Which Suggests Recovery

### From Some of the Drug-induced Dopaminergic Alterations

### Following Protracted Abstinence (proton MRS: Nordahl Et Al.

### 2005; PET Dopamine-ligand: Volkow Et Al. 2001b; FDG-

### PET: Wang Et Al. 2004).

### Chronic Opiate Abuse Has Been Associated with Marked

### Changes in the Density of P-opioid Receptors Throughout the

### Brain (Kling Et Al. 2000; Melichar Et Al. 2005). Although

### Methadone is Used as a Substitute for Heroin for the

### Treatment of Opiate-dependent Individuals, the Long-lasting

### Effects Between These Two Opiates Differ. Thus, Methadone

### Administered in a Maintenance Regimen Results in an up­

### Regulation of P-opioid Receptors, Which Persists Even After

### Detoxification From Opiates (Daglish and Nutt 2003);

### Conversely Post-mortem Analyses of Chronic Heroin Users

### Have Shown a Down-regulation of P-opioid Receptors

### (Gabilondo Et Al. 1994). Regarding Monoamines neuro­

### Transmission, Chronic Opiate Users Has Been Associated with

### Reduced Densities in Noradrenaline (a2) and Dopamine (D2)

### Receptors (Gabilondo Et Al. 1994; Wang Et Al. 1997), but No

### Evidence for Neurotoxic Effects on Dopamine Neurons Has

### Been Identified (Kish Et Al. 2001). In Particular, the Effects on

### The Dopamine System Overall in Opiate Users Are Less pro­

### Nounced Than in Stimulant Users (Kish Et Al. 2001). Functional

### And Structural Abnormalities in Opiate Users Are Less Specific

### Than Those Observed in Amphetamine Users (Danos Et Al.

### 1998a, 1998b; Gerra Et Al . 1998; Lyoo Et Al . 2006; Rose Et Al.

### 1996; Pezawas Et Al. 1998).

### In Summary, Neuropathological Changes Associated with

### Chronic Use of Amphetamines Have Been Well Documented

dopamingergic pathways. Accordingly, structural and func­ tional anomalies in areas of dopamine pathways, the corticostriatal loops, have been identified in chronic amphetamine users, as measured by neuroimaging tech­ niques. In contrast to the extensive research in psychosti­ mulant users, the neuropathological changes in opiate users have been far less investigated to date. There is however,

### Substantial Evidence Showing That Chronic Opiate Use is Associated with Marked Changes in the Opioid System, While the Dopamine System Seems to Be Less Affected. Abnormal­ Ities in Brain Structure and Function Appear to Be Less Pronounced and Less Specific Than in Psychostimulant Users. In Light of Differences in Pharmacological Actions of Amphetamines and Opiates, and in the Neuropathology Associated with Chronic Use of These Substances, it May Be Anticipated That Cognitive Function Would Be More Severely Impaired in Chronic Users of Amphetamines Compared to Chronic Users of Opiates.

### While This Review Will Focus on the Cognitive neuropath­ Ological Changes Associated with Amphetamine and Opiate Dependence in Neural Networks Subserving Cognitive func­ Tion, it Should Be Noted That the Adverse Effects of Chronic Abuse of Amphetamines and of Opiates on the Central Nervous

### System Are Complex (Brust 1998; Neiman Et Al. 2000), Making Chronic Drug Users Susceptible to Numerous neuro­ Logical Complications Which May Also Affect Cognition. These Include Ischemic and Haemorrhagic Stroke (Buttner Et Al. 2000; Buxton & McConachie, 2000; Mathew & Wilson,

### 1991), Cardiovascular Problems Such as Myocardial infarc­ Tion (Yu Et Al., 2003), and Infectious Diseases (Neaigus Et Al., 2007; Urbina & Jones, 2004). Medical Complications Are Either Directly Related to the Properties of the Drug of Choice, for Example, Immunosuppression Caused by Opiates (Sacerdote, 2006), Increased Cerebral Blood Flow Caused by Amphetamines (Russo Et Al., 1991), or Produced by Agents Used for the ‘cutting’ of Street Drugs (Poulsen Et Al., 1996). Medical Problems May Also Occur as a Consequence of the Pattern of Drug Use, for Example, Hypoxia Following Intravenous Heroin Use (Dursteler-MacFarland Et Al., 2000), or Cardiac Pathology Following Methamphetamine Binges

### (Varner Et Al., 2002). Furthermore, the Drug users’ Nutritional

### Status (Kumar, 2007; Virmani Et Al., 2006) and Lifestyle May Also Account for Some of the Medical Problems Observed (e.g. a Heightened Risk of Infectious Diseases Due to Needle Sharing or Promiscuity [Neaigus Et Al., 2007; Urbina & Jones, 2004; Warner & Srinivasan, 2004]).

### **The Profile of Cognitive Deficits Associated** **with Amphetamine and Opiate Dependence**

## Executive Functions Represent High-level, Dissociable cog­ Nitive Abilities Such as Planning, Working Memory, Atten-

### Tional Set Shifting, and Inhibition of Prepotent Responses,

### Which Are Necessary for Goal-directed Behavior (Baddeley

### 1986; Burgess 1997). Executive Dysfunction Has Generally

### Been Linked with a Frontal Lobe Pathology (see Both for

### Review Elliott 2003; Robbins 1996), Including Chronic

### Substance Abuse (Rogers and Robbins 2001). In the

### Following Sections, Impairments in Selected Executive and

### Memory Domains in Chronic Users of Amphetamines and

### Opiates Are Discussed.

### **Cognitive Flexibility**

## Cognitive Flexibility Has Been Defined as ‘the Ability to Shift

### Avenues of Thought and Action in Order to Perceive, Process,

### And Respond to Situations in Different ways’ (Eslinger and

### Grattan 1993). The Wisconsin Cart Sorting Test (WCST)

### (Grant And Berg 1948) and the intra-dimensional/extra-

### Dimensional (IDED) Set-shifting Task of the CANTAB Test

### Battery (Downes Et Al. 1989; Rogers Et Al. 2000b) Both

### Shown in Fig. 1, Have Been Widely Used to Assess Cognitive

### Flexibility in Laboratory Settings. The Latter Paradigm

### Specifically Measures the Ability to Shift Away From a

### Previously Relevant Stimulus Dimension Towards a Newly

### Relevant Dimension (i.e., Extra-dimensional [ED]-shift),

### Which is Formally Akin to a Category Shift on the WCST

### And Has Been Associated with Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex

### Function (Konishi Et Al. 1998a; Rogers Et Al. 2000b). The

### IDED Task, in Particular, Has Proven Suitable for transla­

### Tional Medicine Approach (Birrell and Brown 2000; Dias

### Et Al. 1997). Studies with Current amphetamine/metham-

### Phetamine Users Have Shown Marginal to Severe Impairment

### On Cognitive Flexibility (Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Omstein Et Al.

### 2000; Simon Et Al. 2000), Although These Deficits Were Not

### Evident in Abstinent amphetamine/methamphetamine Users

### (Hoffman Et Al. 2006). Interestingly, There is Some Evidence

### Indicating That Impaired Cognitive Flexibility in metham­

### Phetamine Users is Associated with Male, but Not with

### Female Gender (Kim Et Al. 2005b). This Proposal Finds

### Support From Experimental Animal Studies Showing Greater

### Neurotoxic Damage of Methamphetamine to Male Than to

### Female Brains Following Administration of the Same Amount

### Of the Drug in Animals of the Same Age (Wagner Et Al. 1993).

### It May Therefore Be That Factors Such as Heavier Drug Use or

### An Earlier Age of Onset Only Partly Account for the More

### Severe Cognitive Impairment in Male Methamphetamine

### Users. Taken Together, This May Suggest That Amphetamine

### Exposure in Male Stimulant Users Acutely Impairs the

### Shifting of a Mental Set, While Protracted Abstinence From

### Amphetamines May Restore Attentional Set-shifting Function.

### Compromised Cognitive Flexibility in Abstinent metham­

### Phetamine Users Has Been Shown to Be Associated with

### Decreased Frontal White Matter Metabolism (Kim Et Al.

Springer

## 2003), Is Interesting, Given the Relationship Between Performance and D2 Receptor Availability (Mehta Et Al.

## 1999, 2004; Volkow Et Al. 1998). One May Speculate Whether the Improved Task Performance During Protracted Abstinence in Amphetamine Users is Concomitant with Recovery in Dopamine Transmission (Volkow Et Al. 2001b; Wang Et Al. 2004). In Contrast to the Findings in amphet­ Amine Users, Most Studies in Current and Former Opiate Users Did Not Identify Impairments on Cognitive Flexibility,

## Suggesting That Chronic Opiate Consumption Does Not Have an Impact on Attentional Set-shifting (Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Pau Et Al. 2002; Rotheram-Fuller Et Al. 2004; VerdejoGarcia Et Al. 2005; Verdejo-Garcia and Perez-Garcia 2006).

## The WCST and IDED Tasks Also Assess the Capacity to Relearn a Stimulus-reward Association by Inhibition of the Previously Reinforced Dimension (i.e. Reversal shift), Which is Subserved by Orbitofrontal-striatal Pathways (Dias Et Al.

## 1997; Rogers Et Al. 2000a). Neither Amphetamine nor Opiate Users Were Measurably Impaired on the Reversal Shift in the IDED Task (Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Johanson Et Al. 2006; Omstein Et Al. 2000). Although Impaired Response Reversal on the WCST is Thought to Reflect a High Level of Attentional Disturbance Compared with Perseverative Responding During Reversal Learning Tasks (Nagahama Et Al. 2001), it is of Note That Neither Amphetamine nor Opiate Users Showed impair­ Ment in Response Reversal During a Probabilistic Response Reversal Learning Task (Ersche Et Al. Under review). However, it Has to Be Acknowledged That Some Studies Have Reported Increased Perseverative Responding on the WCST in Methadone-maintained Opiate Users (Darke Et Al. 2000; Lyvers and Yakimoff 2003; Pirastu Et Al. 2006). Response Perseveration on the WCST Has Been Associated with Early Methadone Withdrawal (Lyvers and Yakimoff 2003), Comorbid Alcohol Dependence and Previous Heroin Overdoses (Darke Et Al. 2000) but Does Not Seem to Be a Characteristic Behavioral Correlate of Opiate Dependence.

## **Inhibitory Control**

# A Hallmark of Drug Dependence is the Loss of Control Over

## Substance Intake, Despite the Negative Consequences in­ Volved (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Lack of Inhibition Has Been Regarded as a Key Element of Drug Addiction, Including the Suppression of Emotional, Cognitive and Behavioral Responses (Goldstein and Volkow 2002; Jentsch and Taylor 1999). Inhibitory Control Can Be Investigated in the Behavioral and Cognitive Domains.

## Behavioral Inhibition

## Behavioral or Motor Response Inhibition is Defined as the Process Required to Stop a Planned Movement (see Aron Et Al.

2004; Chamberlain and Sahakian 2007) and is assessed using paradigms such as the Go-Nogo or Stop-Signal Reaction Time task (Dougherty et al. 2003; Evenden 1999; Hom et al. 2003). As shown in Fig. 2b, in the GoNogo task, participants have to respond quickly to visual ‘go’ cues but suppress the prepared response whenever a ‘nogo’ cue occurs on the computer screen. The index of behavioral inhibition is the number of false responses on ‘nogo’ trials (i.e., commission errors), which has been associated with activation in inferior frontal gyrus (Chikazoe et al. 2007; Konishi et al. 1998b). To our knowledge, no neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates during ‘go-nogo’ performance in meth­ amphetamine users. Cocaine users, however, exhibit not only significant inhibition failure by making more false responses on ‘nogo’ trials than controls, but also show significant inattention to ‘go’ cues, as reflected in a  higher rate of false misses (i.e., omission errors) (Kaufman et al. 2003). Interestingly, attenuated error-related activation in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was detected during ‘go-nogo’ performance, suggesting disturbances in the processing of errors (Kaufman et al. 2003). Alternatively, the attenuated error-related activation may also indicate that cocaine users had difficulty differentiating target from non­ target stimuli, since the ACC is thought to play a  key role in conflict and action monitoring (e.g. Carter et al. 1998; Gehring and Knight 2000). Remarkably, task-related activation in regions that have previously been implicated in behavioral inhibition during ‘go-nogo’ performance, such as the right inferior frontal gyrus, did not differ between cocaine users and controls. Thus, it is not clear whether inhibition failure during ‘go-nogo’ performance

## **Fig. 2 a** In the Stop-Signal Task, Participants Are Presented with a Series of Stimuli and Are Instructed to Press the Button on the Left of the Response Panel When the Arrow on the Screen is Pointing to the Left, and to Press the Button on the Right When the Arrow is Pointing to the Right. After a Practice Session of 16 ‘go’ Trials, Participants Are Instructed to Withhold Their Responses When They Hear a Stop-signal (which Occurs in 25% of the Trials in the Form of an Auditory ‘beep’ Sound-a 300 Hz tone), B In the Go-Nogo Task, Participants Are Presented with a Series of Letters, and Are Instructed to Press a Button as Quickly and Accurately as possi­ Ble in Response to Any Letter Presented Except to the Letter X

## Reflects Attentional Problems and/or Inefficient Inhibitory Control.

## The Stop-Signal Task, in Contrast to the Go-Nogo Task, Does Not Involve Switching Between Target and Non-target

## Stimuli, but Requires Participants to Respond Quickly to ‘go’ Cues Unless They Hear a Beep (in 25% of trials), Which Provides the Signal to Suppress This Prepared Motor Response (see Fig. 2a). The Stop-signal Reaction Time Indexes the Time That an Individual Needs to Withhold the Prepotent Response, Which is Associated with the Integrity of the Right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (Aron Et Al. 2004; Chamberlain and Sahakian 2007; Rubia Et Al. 2003). Both Methamphetamine and Cocaine Users Have a Significantly Longer Stopping Process Than Controls, as Reflected by a Significantly Longer Stop-

## Signal Reaction Time, Suggesting That Response Inhibition is Compromised in Psychostimulant Users Independently From Attentional Processing (Fillmore and Rush 2002; Monterosso Et Al. 2005). Inhibition Failure on the Stop-Signal Task is Associated with the Previous Amount of Methamphetamine Consumed (Monterosso Et Al. 2005), and May Reflect dose­ Dependent Neuroadaptive Changes Underlying Poor behav­ Ioral Inhibition in Chronic Users of Methamphetamine. Indeed, Functional and Structural Abnormalities Have Been Identified in the Inferior Frontal Gyrus in Methamphetamine Users (Thompson Et Al. 2004; Volkow Et Al. 2001a), Which Fuel Speculation That Disruptions in the Neural Network Involving the Inferior Frontal Gyrus May Underlie the Poor Behavioral Inhibitory Control in Chronic Methamphetamine Users (Monterosso Et Al. 2005).

Rush 2002; Kaufman et al. 2003; Monterosso et al. 2005), the majority of studies did not find behavioral inhibition deficits in opiate users (Forman et al. 2004; Fishbein et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2005; Verdejo-Garcia et al. 2007).

## In the Cognitive Domain, Inhibitory Control is Frequently Assessed by the Stroop Test (Stroop 1992), Which Requires Participants to Suppress a Salient but Conflicting Stimulus Property While Identifying a Less Salient One (e.g., Reading the Word ‘blue’ That is Written in Red Ink Requires More Cognitive Effort, So-called Interference Control, Than Reading the Word ‘blue’ When Written in Blue ink). Neuroimaging Research Has Shown That the ACC is Critically Involved in the Detection of the Conflict Between Task-relevant and Taskirrelevant Stimulus Properties During the Stroop Task (Bench Et Al. 1993; Leung Et Al. 2000; Pardo Et Al. 1990). Growing Evidence Indicates That Cognitive Control is Compromised in Both Amphetamine (Salo Et Al. 2002, 2007; Simon Et Al. 2002) and Opiate Users (Fishbein Et Al. 2007; Mintzer and Stitzer 2002; Prosser Et Al. 2006; Verdejo-Garcia Et Al. 2007). For Example, Poor Interference Control Has Been Associated with Decreased Concentrations of N-acetylaspartate in the ACC in Methamphetamine Users (Salo Et Al. 2007; Taylor Et Al. 2004), Which Has Been Considered a Marker of Neuronal Loss (Tsai and Coyle 1995). This Finding is in Keeping with the Structural and Functional Abnormalities in the ACC Previously Observed in Methamphetamine Users (Hwang Et Al. 2006; London Et Al. 2004, 2005; Nordahl Et Al. 2002; Thompson Et Al. 2004), Elucidating the Underpinnings of the Impaired Ability to Effectively Monitor Situations of Conflict in This Drug User Group (Salo Et Al. 2005). Some Studies, However, Did Not Find Impaired Interference Control in Recently Abstinent Methamphetamine Users (Chang Et Al. 2002; Hoffman Et Al. 2006; Kalechstein Et Al. 2003), Which May Suggest Partial Recovery of Brain Function Following Abstinence From Methamphetamine (Nordahl Et Al. 2005; Wang Et Al. 2004). Profound Impairment in Suppressing Conflicting infor­ Mation on the Standard Color Stroop Task Has Been Identified in Opiate Users (Fishbein Et Al. 2007; Mintzer and Stitzer 2002; Prosser Et Al. 2006; Verdejo-Garcia Et Al. 2007). The Type of Opiate Used Does Not Seem to Influence Performance on the Stoop Task (Gruber Et Al. 2006; Verdejo-Garcia Et Al. 2005). Given the Key Role of the ACC in Conflict Monitoring, One May Speculate That Dysfunction in This Area Also Accounts for the Poor Performance on the Stroop Test in Opiate Users. Indeed, There is Now Growing Evidence suggest­ Ing That ACC Function May Be Compromised in Opiate Users (Ersche Et Al. 2006b; Forman Et Al. 2004; Lee Et Al. 2005; Yucel Et Al. 2007). For Example, Opiate Users Showed Attenuated Error-related Activation in the ACC During the

Springer

## Go-Nogo Task (Forman Et Al. 2004) and Lack a Normal Relationship Between Activation of ACC and Adaptive Responding to Negative Feedback (Ersche Et Al. 2006b) and to Errors (Yucel Et Al. 2007). Reduced Levels of the Metabolite N-acetylaspartate Have Also Been Reported in Chronic Opiate Users (Haselhorst Et Al. 2002; Yucel Et Al. 2007), but in Contrast to Methamphetamine Users (Salo Et Al. 2007), These Abnormalities Were Not Associated with behav­ Ioral Performance. At Present, the Nature of Underlying Biochemical Abnormalities Such as the Significant Reductions in N-acetylaspartate in Chronic Drug Users is Still Unclear. Given That the ACC Has a High Density of Opioid Receptors (see Vogt Et Al. 1995), and Has Been Implicated in Opioid Analgesia (Casey Et Al. 2000; Petrovic Et Al. 2002), it Seems Conceivable That Chronic Exposure to Opiate Agonists Such as Methadone and Heroin, Modulates ACC Function During Cognitively Challenging Tasks Such as the Stroop Task. Previous Research Has Shown That Task-related Activation During the Stroop Task Overlaps with the Neural Network Involved in Processing of Pain (Derbyshire Et Al. 1998) and Opioid Analgesia Respectively (Petrovic Et Al. 2002).

## **Sustained Attention**

# Sustained Attention Characterizes a State of ‘readiness to Detect Rarely and Unpredictably Occurring Signals Over Prolonged Periods of time’ (Sarter Et Al. 2001) and Has Frequently Been Assessed by Various Versions of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) (see Borgaro Et Al. 2003). In This Test, Participants Are Required to Maintain Vigilance and to React When Target Stimuli Are Presented but to Avoid Responding When Distractors Occur. Performance is Usually Assessed by Signal Detection Index (dr) Which Takes into Account the Number of Missed Targets and the Number of False Alarms. London Et Al. (2005) Has Recently Shown That Methamphetamine Users Made Significantly More Errors on an Auditory Version of the CPT Than Non-drug Taking Controls. Most Importantly, the Authors Found That d’ Was

## Significantly Smaller in Methamphetamine Users Than in Controls, Providing Evidence for Impairments in metham­ Phetamine users’ Ability to Discriminate Targets From non­ Targets. Poor Test Performance Was Further Reflected in Abnormal Glucose Metabolism in the ACC, Insula and Orbitofrontal Cortex at Rest. Interestingly, Compared with Controls, Glucose Metabolism in the ACC Was Significantly Reduced, and Correlated Negatively with the Recent Amount of Methamphetamine Used (London Et Al. 2004). Metham­ Phetamine Users with Relatively Elevated Glucose metabo­ Lism at Rest Made Significantly Fewer Errors During the Task (London Et Al. 2005). This May Suggest That Drug Users with a Smaller Consumption of Methamphetamine Were Able to Compensate for an Underlying Neuropathology; a Plausible

proposal given that methamphetamine-induced neural dam­ age in the frontal lobe, including the ACC, has shown to be dose-dependent (Oh et al. 2005; Sung et al. 2007). It is important to note that the aforementioned group differences on the CPT became only apparent over a  30-minute testing session (London et al. 2005), but not during a  15-minute session (London et al. 2004), which suggests that metham­ phetamine users are to some extent able to compensate for the underlying neuropathology. Although the length of the administered version of the CPT is likely to determine the detection of deficits in sustained attention in stimulant users, the nature of the impairments identified is still unknown. It is important to acknowledge that not all studies find impairments in measures of signal detection (cT) on the CPT in stimulant users. For example, Levine et al. (2006) identified inattentiveness in stimulant users by increased numbers of omission errors and great reaction time variability, although measures of discrimination targets and non-targets did not differ from controls. In light of the dose-dependent effects of methamphetamine on ACC, one may speculate whether the type of stimulants used (i.e., amphetamine versus cocaine) or the pattern of drug use (i.e., chronic versus recreational use) might account for differences in perfor­ mance profiles observed. Although poor performance in the detection of targets has repeatedly been found in methadone-maintained opiate users (Forman et al. 2004; Mintzer and Stitzer 2002), relatively little is known about the underlying neuropathology of these impairments in opiate users. Abnormalities in glucose metabolism and brain metabolites in the ACC of opiate users have been reported (Galynker et al. 2000; Yucel et al. 2007) and it is conceivable that opiate users need to compensate for ACC dysfunction in order to meet attentional demands. Functional MRI studies in opiate users have provided preliminary evidence for this assertion, since task related under-activation of the ACC has been associated with deficits in the detection of targets (Forman et al. 2004). Normal task-related activation in the ACC, concomitant with additional recruitment of brain regions that are not typically activated by non-drug users, however, is associated with normal performance in opiate users (Yucel et al. 2007). Although attentional dysfunction has repeatedly been iden­ tified in laboratory settings (Forman et al. 2004; Mintzer and Stitzer 2002), driving ability (which requires sustained attention) is considered to be intact in chronic opiate users (Fishbain et al. 2003; Stout and Farrell 2003). It may be that the compensatory recruitment of brain areas enables opiate users to drive safely without being involved in significantly more road accidents than non-drug users (see Fishbain et al. 2003). In summary, more research is needed to better understand the engagement of neural networks during forms of attentional processing in opiate dependent individuals.

## **Strategic Planning**

# The Ability to ‘think ahead’ and Actively Search for an Appropriate Solution is an Essential Part of Goal Directed Behavior, and is Required in Many Daily Activities (Owen

## 1997). The Tower of London Test (Shallice 1982; Owen Et Al.

## 1990), Or the More Difficult Version, the One-touch Tower of London (Owen Et Al. 1995), Are Widely Used Means to Assess

## Strategic Planning in Laboratory Settings. Multiple Lines of Evidence Indicate That Planning Performance on the Tower of London is Subserved by a Neural Network Including the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (Baker Et Al. 1996; Dagher Et Al. 2001; Manes Et Al. 2002). Both Amphetamine and Opiate Users, Regardless of Current Drug Status, Solved Significantly Fewer Problems Correctly on the One-touch Tower of London, and Therefore Needed More Attempts in Order to Generate Correct Answers Compared to Controls (Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Omstein Et Al. 2000). This Behavioral Deficit Occurred in the Absence of Latency Differences Between the Groups And, as

## Such, Was Not Secondary to Motor Impulsivity (Ersche Et Al. 2006a). Whilst Amphetamine and Opiate Users Were Equally Impaired on Planning Problems of Medium and High Levels of Difficulty, Amphetamine Users Also Struggled with gener­ Ating Solutions for the Relatively Easy Three-move Problems (Ersche Et Al. 2006a). The First Stages of the Tower of London (i.e., Oneto Three-move problems) Require Relatively Little Planning Ability, Since They Can Easily Be Solved by a Visual Matching-to-sample Strategy (Owen 1997). In Light of Accumulating Evidence Showing That Basic Visuospatial Function, as Assessed by the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (see Stem Et Al. 1994), is Not Impaired in Amphetamine Users (Chang Et Al. 2005; Hoffman Et Al. 2006; Kalechstein Et Al. 2003; Toomey Et Al. 2003), it is Conceivable That the Poor Performance of Amphetamine Users at This Low Level of Difficulty May Reflect Either an Over-confident Approach Towards the Solution or an Inefficiency in Concentrating on the Task Demands. High-level Cognitive Planning, as Assessed on the Tower of London by Planning Problems Requiring Mental Organization of Four to Six-sequences of Moves, Overlaps with Different Aspects of Working Memory (Owen

## 1997; Robbins Et Al. 1998). Therefore, it May Not Be

## Surprising That Amphetamine and Opiate Users Have Also

## Shown Poor Performance on Tasks Requiring Complex Spatial Working Memory Function and Visuo-spatial Strategy gener­ Ation (Omstein Et Al. 2000). The Marked Impairment in

## Solving Planning Problems on the Tower of London Exemplifies the Difficulty of Drug Users to Mentally Organize Behavior to Achieve a Goal Through a Series of Intermediate

## Steps.

## The Fact That Planning Impairment Was Not Only Observed in Current Users of Amphetamine and Opiates but Also in a Group of Former Drug Users Who Had Been Drug Abstinent for an Average of Eight Years, May Indicate That Impairments Do

not simply reflect the current effect of the drug. Longitu­ dinal studies are needed to settle the question whether neurocognitive impairment was caused by chronic drug exposure or predated drug-taking, or even represents a combination of both. Lack of planning and forethought has also been considered being a  component of impulsive behavior (Dickman 1990; Evenden 1999). As a  personality trait, non-planning is assessed by subscale of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) (Patton et al. 1995). Both chronic amphetamine users and opiate users not only report higher overall levels of impulsivity compared with non­ drug using controls, they also score higher on the non­ planning subscale of BIS-11 (Clark et al. 2006). In light of the poor performance during strategic planning, one may

## Speculate Whether This Impairment May Contribute to the Impulsive Behavior Pattern Frequently Reported by Chronic Drug Users.

## **Decision-Making**

# The Ability to Make Decisions is a Key Element in Human Behavior Because the Way People Behave Socially, finan­ Cially, Ecologically, and Politically Largely Depends on This Ability (Hastie 2001; Mellers Et Al. 1998). Because Decisions Are Usually Made with a View to a Favorable Outcome, Rewards Provide the Motivation to Make deci­

## Sions. Cognition is Necessary to Appraise the Options and Alternatives, Assessing the Means to Achieve Them and Evaluate the Consequences Involved with Each Choice (Ernst and Paulus 2005; Hastie 2001).

## Neuropsychological Studies Have Been Investigating Decision-making Abilities in Chronic Drug Users with Different Experimental Paradigms, Providing Evidence That Decision-making Performance Differs Between the Type of

## Substance Used. For Example, the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) (Bechara Et Al. 1997), Shown in Fig. 3a, Requires a

## Series of Card Selections to Be Made Concerning Winning and Losing Monetary Rewards. Optimal Performance Requires Switching From Selecting Cards From High gain/ High Loss Decks to Low gain/low Loss but More Profitable Decks. The Main Measure is the Net-score, Which is Calculated From the Total Number of Cards Selected From the Two Advantageous Minus the Two Disadvantageous Decks, Reflecting the Decision-making Strategy Across the Task. There Are Inconsistencies in Drug users’ decision­ Making Strategies on the IGT Across Studies, and Not All Report the Net-score. Among Those Studies That Report the Net-score, Some Did Not Find a Measurable Decision-making Impairment in Psychostimulant, Opiate, and Polydrug Users (Adinoff Et Al. 2003; Bolla Et Al. 2003; Ernst Et Al. 2003; Mintzer and Stitzer 2002; Mintzer Et Al. 2005), Whereas Others Found Significantly Smaller but Positive Net-scores in

**Fig. 3  a** In the Iowa Gambling task, participants are presented with

four card decks and asked to make series of card selections concerning

winning and losing monetary rewards. Participants are not told that

there are ‘safe’ and ‘risky’ decks. Over the course of the task,

participants generally develop a  preference for the ‘safe’ decks (C and

D) over the risky decks (A and B). The net-score, which is calculated

from the total number of cards selected from ‘safe’ minus ‘risky’

decks, reflects the decision-making strategy across the task, b  The

Risk Task requires participants to choose between two mutually

exclusive options with different probabilities of reward and punish­

ment. On each trial, an array of six boxes is presented on the screen,

with a  ratio of red and blue boxes that varies from trial to trial (5:1,

4:2, 3:3 boxes). Participants are told that the computer had hidden a

yellow token, at random, behind one of the six boxes and they need to

decide whether the token is hidden behind a  red or blue box. Their

decision on each trial is shaped by a  fixed bet, associated with each

alternative, regarding the magnitude of potential gain or loss (90:10,

80:20, 70:30; 60:40, 50:50 points). Feedback is provided by the way

of gain or loss of points following each trial. Since the least likely

option is always associated with the large reward value, participants

these groups of drug users compared with controls (Bechara et al. 2001; Grant et al. 2000; Pirastu et al. 2006; VerdejoGarcia and Perez-Garcia 2006), reflecting a  disadvanta­ geous decision-making strategy. It seems that only

# Subgroups of Polydrug Users (Bechara Et Al. 2002) and

# Subgroups of Opiate Users (Rotheram-Fuller Et Al. 2004; Pirastu Et Al. 2006) Have Negative Net-scores, Indicating That These Drug Users Preferably Chose Cards From the ‘risky decks.’ Negative Net-scores Have Also Been Identified in Other Clinical Groups, for Example in Suicide Attempters, Independently From Their Drug Using Habits (Jollant Et Al. 2005) and in Psychopathic Individuals (Mitchell Et Al. 2002 e.g.; Van Honk Et Al. 2002). Interestingly, Vassileva Et Al. (2007) Have Recently Shown Significant Differences in Decision-making Strategies Between Psychopathic and Nonpsychopathic Opiate Users. While the Psychopathic Opiate Users Consistently Selected Cards From Risky Decks, the Nonpsychopathic Opiate Users Successfully Adjusted Their deci­

# Sion-making Strategy in the Course of the Task Toward the Advantageous Decks. This Selection Strategy Suggests Difficulties in the Learning Reward-contingencies, Which at the Beginning of the Task Have Resulted in Risky Decisions. Taken Together, Accumulating Evidence Indicates That Drug Abuse per Se Does Not Mediate Decision-making on the IGT but it May Act as a Moderator, Aggravating Existing Decision-making Impairments.

# One Major Drawback of the IGT is That Volunteers Need to Leam Reward-punishment Associations Over the Course of the Task, Which Means That Individuals Who Are Poor Learners May Develop a Less Successful Decision-making

# Strategy Than Good Learners (Clark and Robbins 2002). Consequently, the Cambridge Gamble Task (CGT) (Rogers Et Al. 1999a) and the Risk Task (Rogers Et Al. 1999b) Have Been Developed to Investigate Decision-making indepen­ Dently From Learning. In the CGT, Participants Make Choices Between Two Mutually Exclusive Options and Place Bets on the Expected Outcome. Learning on the CGT is Obviated by Providing Information About Outcome Probabilities and Reward Values on the Screen and by the Fact That Each Trial is Independent From Its Predecessor. The Risk Task is a Variant of the CGT, Which Investigates Decision-making in a Reward-conflict Situation (see Fig. 3b). Research Findings Regarding Decision-making in Chronic Drug Users, Using Either the CGT or the Risk Task, Are Strikingly Similar to Findings on the IGT. Chronic Amphetamine Users, but Not Opiate Users, Showed Disadvantageous Decision-making (Rogers Et Al. 1999a). Amphetamine Users Overall Selected the Likely Small Reward Option Less Frequently (i.e., in Only

# 85% Of trials) Than Opiate Users (92%) and Controls (95%), but

# Showed No Signs of Impaired Risk Adjustment (Rogers Et Al.

# 1999a). In Other Words, Although Amphetamine Users Chose Disadvantageously, They Neither Increased Their Gambles on the Less Favorable Options nor Did They Significantly Choose

# Against the Odds on the Risky Conditions. Disadvantageous

# Decision-making Strategy in Amphetamine Users on the CGT

# And Risk Task Appears to Be Due to Impairment in Correctly

# Estimating Outcome Probabilities and May Not Reflect a

# Reward-seeking Strategy per Se. This Proposal Finds Support

# From Neuroimaging Research, Showing That methamphet­

# Amine Users Were Not Different Regarding the Sensitivity to

# Positive or Negative Feedback, but Showed Disruptions in the

# Neural Network Implicated in Processing of Feedback

# Information, on the Basis of Which Outcome Probabilities

# Were Estimated (Paulus Et Al. 2002, 2003). Disadvantageous

# Choices Particularly in Amphetamine Users Were Also Evident

# On the Risk Task (Ersche Et Al. 2005a, 2005b). For Example,

# In a Neuroimaging Study, Amphetamine Users Selected the

# Most Favorable Option in 72% of Trials (opiate: 82%, and ex­

# Drug: 79%, Controls: 87%) (Ersche Et Al. 2005a). Although

# This Difference Was Not Statistically Significant, the neuro­

# Imaging Data Revealed Significant Disturbance in the media­

# Tion of Decision-making by the Prefrontal Cortex in All Three

# Drug User Groups. Chronic Amphetamine or Opiate Users,

# Regardless of Whether They Were Currently Using Drugs,

# Showed Over-activation in the Orbitofrontal Cortex and

# Under-activation in the Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex. These

# Findings Are Consistent with Other Neuroimaging Studies in

# Drug Users (e.g., Bolla Et Al. 2003), Showing Abnormal Brain

# Activation During Decision-making, Even Before Impairment

# Becomes Behaviorally Measurable.

# At Present, the Nature of Impaired Decision-making in

# Drug Users is Still Unclear. There is Some Evidence That

# Working-memory Deficits Adversely Affect Performance on

# The IGT (Bechara and Martin 2004). Sub-optimal Choices

# On the CGT and Risk Task Have Been Linked with the

# Duration of Amphetamine Use (Rogers Et Al. 1999a) and the

# Previous Amount of Daily Cocaine Use (Monterosso Et Al.

# 2001) , Which Might Indicate an Adverse Effect of Chronic

# Stimulant Use on Probability Estimations. Risky Choices on

# The Risk Task Have Been Associated with Low Intelligence in

# Poly Drug Users (Fishbein Et Al. 2005), While Risky reward­

# Seeking on the IGT Has Been Related to Abnormalities in

# Anticipatory Skin Conductance Responses, Prior to Card

# Selections From the ‘risky decks’ (Bechara Et Al. 1997).

# Polydrug Users Who Showed Risky Card Selections on a

# Discounting Version of the IGT Had Abnormal Anticipatory

# Skin Conductance Responses, Reflecting a Hypersensitivity to

# Reward and a Hyposensitivity to Punishment (Bechara Et Al.

# 2002) . This Pattern of Abnormal Skin Conductance Responses

# Has Been Interpreted as an Inability to Utilize Ongoing

# Feedback in Guiding Future Decisions (Bechara Et Al. 2002).

or sensation seeking (Leland and Paulus 2005), which may exacerbate decision-making problems in individuals with substance use disorders.

# **Memory And Learning**

# A Substantial Body of Evidence Has Shown a Wide Range of Learning and Memory Impairments in Chronic Amphetamine and Methamphetamine Users (Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Gonzalez Et Al. 2004; Hoffman Et Al. 2006; Kalechstein Et Al. 2003; Moon Et Al. 2007; Omstein Et Al. 2000; Rippeth Et Al. 2004; Simon Et Al. 2002; Woods Et Al. 2005). Memory Impairment in Chronic Amphetamine Users is Related to Self-reported Severity of Drug Use (McKetin and Mattick 1998) and Correlates with the Availability of Dopamine Transporters in the Striatum (Volkow Et Al. 2001d). There is Evidence That Verbal Memory Performance Improves Following Protracted Drug Abstinence (Wang Et Al. 2004). Woods Et Al. (2005) Have Shown That Memory Impairment in Methamphetamine Users is Not Necessarily Due to Mnemonic Dysfunction but May Result From Inefficient Strategies in Encoding, organiz­ Ing and Retrieving Information. Impairment in Memory Function Associated with Chronic Opiate Users is Less Consistent in the Literature: While a Number of Studies Identified Various Aspects of Memory Impairment Such as word/pattem Recognition, Learning and Recall of words/figures, Episodic Memory, Paired Associate Learning and Retrieval (Amir and Bahri 1994; Darke Et Al. 2000; Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Fishbein Et Al. 2007; Guerra Et Al. 1987; Omstein Et Al. 2000; Papageorgiou Et Al. 2004; Pirastu Et Al. 2006; Prosser Et Al. 2006), Others Do Not Find Memory Deficits in Opiate Users (Davis Et Al. 2002; Mintzer Et Al. 2005; Rapeli Et Al. 2006; Rounsaville Et Al. 1982). The Reasons for These Inconsistencies Are Less Clear but May Be Related to Clinical Differences Between the Samples or Test Sensitivity. Although Most Studies Do Not Find Associations with the Amount of Opiates Consumed or the Duration of Use (Darke Et Al. 2000; Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Prosser Et Al. 2006; Rounsaville Et Al. 1982; Verdejo-Garcia Et Al. 2005), There is Some Evidence That Methadone Impairs Episodic Memory in a Dose-dependent Manner (Curran Et Al. 2001). For Example, Methadone-maintained Opiate Users Showed sig­ Nificantly Better Episodic Memory Recall When They Received Placebo Instead of Their Usual Methadone Treatment (Curran Et Al. 2001). It is Not Clear if the Impairments Were Specific for Methadone or Reflect Opiate-related Impairment, in General. By Contrast, Improved Memory Function Has Been Reported in a Within-subject Comparison, Following Two Months of Enrollment in Methadone-maintenance Treatment (Gruber Et Al. 2006). However, Further Validation Would Be Welcome Because This Study Lacked a Placebo Condition and Did Not Control for Potential Practice Effects.

# **Summary And General Comments**

# Chronic Separate and Combined Use of Amphetamines and Opiates is Associated with a Wide a Range of Cognitive Deficits, Including the Domains of Attention, Inhibitory Control, Planning, Decision-making, Learning and Memory. Although Both Amphetamine Users and Opiate Users Show Marked Impairment in Various Aspects of Cognitive func­ Tion, Substance-specific Differences Are Most Pronounced in Functions of Inhibitory Control and Feedback Processing. For Example, While Amphetamine Users Demonstrate Profound Deficits in Suppressing Planned Actions (behavioral inhibi­ tion) and Thoughts (cognitive inhibition), Impairment in Inhibitory Control in Opiate Users Appears to Be Limited to the Cognitive Domain. Chronic Use of Amphetamines Has Also Shown to Be Associated with Disturbances in the Neural Network Implicated in Feedback Processing, Which May Cause Difficulties Predicting Outcome Probabilities. In Opiate Users, by Contrast, the Impairment in the Processing of Feedback Seems to Be Specific to Feedback of Negative Valence, Such as Errors and Punishment. Compromised Cognitive Function in Both Substance-user Populations is Reflected in Abnormal Patterns of Brain Activation Both at Rest and During Cognitive Performance. Although This Review Did Not Discuss Gender Differences, There is Accumulating Evidence Indicative of Differences in Brain Structure and Function Between Male and Female Stimulant Users (Chang Et Al. 2005; Ersche Et Al. 2006a; Kim Et Al. 2005b; Stout Et Al. 2005). Gender Differences in Brain Function in Chronic Opiate Users Have, to Our Knowledge, Not Been Reported.

# **Clinical Implications of Cognitive Deficits in Chronic** **Drug Users**

# A Substantial Body of Evidence Has Identified Cognitive Dysfunction in Chronic Drug Users, Including Those Using

# Stimulants and Opiates. However, Despite the Increasing Knowledge of Cognitive Dysfunction in This Population, Cognitive Abilities of Drug Users Still Play a Peripheral Role in Clinical Practice, as Reflected in the Most Recent U.K. Department of Health’s Guidelines on Substance Depen­ Dence (1999). In Light of the Growing Need for Improving Treatment Efficacy, in Particular for Psychostimulant Users (de Lima Et Al. 2002; Shearer 2007), Addressing Cognitive Deficits Within Treatment Settings May Prove Beneficial in Three Regards.

treatment efficacy, such that drug users with cognitive impairments are more likely to drop out of treatment early and show less engagement in the treatment process (Aharonovich et al. 2003, 2006; FalsStewart and Schafer 1992; FalsStewart and Lucente 1994a; Katz et al. 2005; Morgenstern and Bates 1999; Teichner et al. 2002). Consequently, the adaptation of treatment to meet the drug users’ cognitive needs is a  necessary prerequisite if individuals with cognitive impairment are to benefit from treatment intervention. By way of example, drug counsel­ ing that makes use of mapping techniques, which addresses drug users’ problems in planning and problem solving by visualising and organizing information, has been shown to improve treatment outcome significantly (Czuchry and Dansereau 2003b; Dansereau and Dees 2002; Pitre et al. 1996). Various strategies developed previously to remediate cognitive dysfunction in patients with traumatic head injuries, are equally suitable for use in cognitively impaired drug users, and could be implemented in treatment settings without major difficulty (see Weinstein and Shaffer 1993 for extensive review). Adjusting interventions to the cognitive abilities of drug users may not only be beneficial for the achievement of treatment goals, but could also improve communication and relationships between drug users and staff (Weinstein and Shaffer 1993).

# Cognitive Assessment on Admission Useful for Clinical Decision-Making

# Standardized Cognitive Status Examination on Admission to Identify the individual’s Strengths and Impairments Would Provide Valuable Information for Clinical Decision-making. Allocation of Treatment Intervention That Meets the Drug user’s Individual Profile Has Received Increased Attention in Recent Years (see Gastfriend and McLellan 1997). Most Approaches Aiming to Match Patients to Treatment interven­ Tion Have Focused on Demographic, Social and Psychiatric Variables (e.g., McLellan Et Al. 1997). However, Growing Evidence Suggests That Cognitive Dysfunction in Drug Users Interacts with Both Pharmacotherapy and Psychotherapy (Block Et Al. 2003; Jaffe Et Al. 1996), and Should Be Taken into Consideration During Clinical Decision-making. For Example, Alcohol Dependent Individuals with Poor Cognitive Function and High Levels of Craving Seem to Respond Particularly Well to Pharmacological Treatment Relative to Placebo (Jaffe Et Al. 1996), and Benefit More From Inpatient Than Outpatient Care (Rychtarik Et Al. 2000). Low Levels of Verbal Learning Appear to Impede Psychotherapy but Do Not Affect the Efficacy of Supportive Treatment Such as Coping Skill Training (Jaffe Et Al. 1996). Neurocognitive Assessment Would Help with Identification of an individuals’ Strengths and Weaknesses, and Assist in Determining Which interven­ Tion Would Be Most Beneficial (Tapert Et Al. 1999, 2004).

# Objective Indicators of Cognitive Function Would Also Improve Drug workers’ Understanding of Drug users’ Problems in Everyday Activities (Verdejo-Garcia and Perez-Garcia 2007). In Fact, an Objective Cognitive Status Examination is More Likely to Reflect the Extent of Impairment Than a counselors’ Subjective Judgement on Drug users’ Cognitive Abilities (FalsStewart 1997). An Emphasis on Neuropsychological Aspects of Assessment and Treatment Would Be Very Useful in the Training of Staff Working in Drug Services, but at Present Neuropsychology is

# Still Leading Only a Shadowy Existence in Current Drug Addiction Training (Boys Et Al. 1997; Kerwin Et Al. 2006).

# Neurocognitive Training and Remediation to Improve Long-Term Outcome

# Improvement in Cognitive Function Through Neurocognitive Training and Remediation, as Part of Drug Rehabilitation, May Enhance Treatment Outcome in the Long-term. Cognitive Training Modules Have Already Shown Effectiveness in a Variety of Clinical Groups, Including Patients with schizophre­ Nia (Bell Et Al. 2005; Hogarty Et Al. 2004; Kosten Et Al. 2006; Wykes Et Al. 2003), Traumatic Brain Injury (Sarajuuri Et Al. 2005), and Chronic Drug Users (Czuchry and Dansereau 2003a; FalsStewart and Lucente 1994b). In Particular, the Training of Attention and Memory Skills, Functions That Are

# Severely Impaired in Both Amphetamine and Opiate Users, May Prove Useful, Since These Abilities Have the Greatest Predictive Value for the Employment of Drug Users (Mackin Et Al. 2005). Cognitive Remediation Programs in Patients with

# Schizophrenia Have Shown Promising Results, Since improve­ Ment in Cognitive Function at Six-month Follow up Was Not Only Reflected in Successful Vocational Rehabilitation but Was Also Associated with Ameliorated Social Functioning and Quality of Life (Bell Et Al. 2005; Wykes Et Al. 2003).

# **Options For Pharmacological Intervention**

# In Light of the Severity of Cognitive Deficits That Can Occur in Chronic Drug Users, the Application of Cognitive Enhancer Drugs to Ameliorate These Deficits Appears Useful (Duka Et Al. 2005; Malcolm Et Al. 2002). Cognition-enhancing Drugs

# Such as Modafinil Have Shown Efficacy Ameliorating Cognitive Inhibition on the Stroop Task in Depressed Patients (DeBattista Et Al. 2004), Enhancing Cognitive Flexibility on the IDED Task in Patients with Schizophrenia (Turner Et Al. 2004b), and Improving Motor-inhibition Deficits on the

# Stop-Signal Task in Adults with Attention Deficit hyperactiv­ Ity Disorder (ADHD) (Turner Et Al. 2004a). Neuroimaging Research Suggests That Modafinil Has the Potential to Modulate Activation in the ACC During Working Memory Performance (Spence Et Al. 2005); an Intriguing Finding in

light of significant under-activation during cognitive per­ formance (Forman et al. 2004; Paulus et al. 2003) and at rest (Galynker et al. 2000; Kim et al. 2005b). Modafinil is an anti-narcoleptic agent with mild stimulant effects through classical (al-receptor) and non-classical (orexin/ hypocretin) arousal pathways (Ballon and Feifel 2006; Ferraro et al. 1999). The weak dopaminergic affinity of modafinil and the low abuse liability resulting from it (Deroche-Gamonet et al. 2002; O’Brien et al. 2006) may provide ideal grounds for a  supplementary treatment of chronic drug users (Malcolm et al. 2002; Vocci et al. 2005). Clinical trials are now needed to establish modafinil’s efficacy in enhancing cognitive function in drug users with diminished cognitive abilities, and to identify those indi­ viduals for whom treatment with modafinil may not be

# Suitable, e.g., Drug Users with Co-morbid Anxiety Disorder (Taneja Et Al. 2007).

# Another Potential Route for Improving Cognitive Function in Chronic Drug Users is Atomoxetine, a Selective noradren­ Aline Reuptake Inhibitor (Bymaster Et Al. 2002), Which Has Been Found to Be Effective in the Treatment of ADHD

# (Michelson Et Al. 2001). Atomoxetine Has Shown to

# Selectively Increase Catecholamine Levels in Frontal Lobes via Noradrenaline Transporters, but Compared to psychosti­ Mulants, Has Low Abuse Liability (Bymaster Et Al. 2002). In Light of atomoxetine’s Efficacy in Improving Behavioral Inhibition in Healthy Volunteers as Well as in Individuals with ADHD (Chamberlain Et Al. 2007), Potential Use in Chronic Drug Users Awaits Investigation.

# In Summary, Growing Evidence Suggests That Addressing Cognitive Deficits in Drug Users in Treatment Settings Offers Great Potential to Improve Overall Treatment Efficacy. The Variety of Options Available for Managing Cognitive dysfunc­ Tion May Allow Implementation in Different Kinds of Clinical

# Settings. Most Important, All Aforementioned Ways in address­ Ing Cognitive Impairments in Drug Users Are Not Mutually Exclusive. It is Even Conceivable That the M Ost Effective Means is a Combined Approach of Psychological Strategies, remedi­ Ation Training, and Cognition-enhancer Drugs.

# **Summary And Outlook**

# Over Recent Years, Neuropsychology Has Provided New Insights into the Neural Basis of Cognitive and Behavioral Problems Associated with Chronic Drug Use, Including Amphetamines and Opiates. The Translation of This knowl­ Edge into Clinical Practice Will Ideally Become Increasingly Apparent in the Coming Years. Investigation into the Specific Components of Impairment, Such as the Processing of Feedback in Amphetamine and Opiate Users (Ersche Et Al. 2005b; Paulus Et Al. 2002, 2003) Would Be of Great Clinical Relevance, Since it May Indicate a Need for Reconsidering the

# Way Feedback is Provided in Clinical Settings. Furthermore,

# Understanding the Neurobiological Substrates Underlying

# Cognitive Impairment in Drug Users May Have the Potential

# To Guide Therapeutic Intervention in the Future.
