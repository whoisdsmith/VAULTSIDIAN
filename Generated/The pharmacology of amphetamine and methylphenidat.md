# Neuropharmacology of ADHD

Highlights • This review discusses amphetamine (AMP) and methylphenidate (MPH) pharmacology. • AMP and MPH increase corticostriatal catecholamine availability in different ways. • Catecholamine alterations occur in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). • Differential mechanisms of AMP and MPH may influence individual treatment response. • Considering stimulant effects is vital when treating ADHD with comorbidities.

Abstract Psychostimulants, including amphetamines and methylphenidate, are first-line pharmacotherapies for individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This review aims to educate physicians regarding differences in pharmacology and mechanisms of action between amphetamine and methylphenidate, thus enhancing physician understanding of psychostimulants and their use in managing individuals with ADHD who may have comorbid psychiatric conditions. A systematic literature review of PubMed was conducted in April 2017, focusing on cellularand brain system-level effects of amphetamine and methylphenidate. The primary pharmacologic effect of both amphetamine and methylphenidate is to increase central dopamine and norepinephrine activity, which impacts executive and attentional function. Amphetamine actions include dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibition, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2) inhibition, and monoamine oxidase activity inhibition. Methylphenidate actions include dopamine and norepinephrine transporter inhibition, agonist activity at the serotonin type 1A receptor, and redistribution of the VMAT-2. There is also evidence for interactions with glutamate and opioid systems. Clinical implications of these

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD 1.0 Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was initially identified in children (1) but is now understood to persist into adulthood in about two thirds of cases (2-4). In a 2007 meta-analysis that included more than 100 studies, the estimated worldwide prevalence of ADHD in individuals <18 years old was 5.29% (5). The estimated prevalence in adults was 4.4% in a national survey in the United States (6), 3.4% in a 10-nation survey (7), and 2.5% in a meta­ regression analysis of 6 studies (8).

A large body of evidence suggests that multiple neurotransmitters and brain structures play a role in ADHD (9-11). Although a substantial amount of research has focused on dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), ADHD has also been linked to dysfunction in serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), acetylcholine (ACH), opioid, and glutamate (GLU) pathways (10, 12-15). The alterations in these neurotransmitter systems affect the function of brain structures that moderate executive function, working memory, emotional regulation, and reward processing (Figure 1) (11).

Individuals with ADHD are often diagnosed with additional psychiatric comorbidities, including anxiety, mood, substance use, sleep disturbances, and antisocial personality disorders (16-18). Importantly, the neurobiological substrates that mediate behaviors associated with ADHD share commonalities to some extent with those involved in these comorbid disorders (1921). Genetic studies have also identified shared genetic risk factors between ADHD and associated comorbid disorders (22, 23). As such, comorbidities need to be taken into account when considering pharmacotherapy in an individual with ADHD.

Although stimulants (including amphetamine [AMPJ-based and methylphenidate

[MPHJ-based agents) and nonstimulants (eg, atomoxetine, clonidine, and guanfacine) are

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD Approved for the Treatment of ADHD (24), Stimulants Are Considered First-line Therapy in Children, Adolescents, and Adults with ADHD Because of Their Greater Efficacy (25-30). AMP and

MPH have been shown to exhibit comparable efficacy in 2 meta-analyses (31, 32), with other analyses reporting that AMP has moderately greater effects than MPH (33-35). The tolerability and safety profiles of AMP and MPH in terms of adverse events, treatment discontinuation, and cardiovascular effects are also generally comparable (36-38), although weight loss and insomnia

have been reported to be more common with AMP than with MPH (32). Additional work is

planned that will further compare the efficacy, tolerability, and safety profiles of different

pharmacologic interventions in children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD (39).

Although increased synaptic availability of DA and NE is a key result of exposure to both AMP and MPH (40, 41), differences in the specific cellular mechanisms of action of AMP and

MPH may influence their effects on the neurobiologicaI substrates of ADHD and response to treatment in individuals with ADHD as well as their effects on common comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety.

The objective of this review is to educate physicians about the mechanisms of action of AMP and MPH and the implications of these actions on the management of ADHD and its comorbidities. To achieve this goal, a systematic review of the published literature was conducted to obtain articles describing the cellularand brain system-level effects of AMP and

MPH. The results of relevant studies are described and interpreted in the context of the treatment of ADHD and in light of the comorbidities associated with ADHD.

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD

A systematic literature review of PubMed was conducted on April 24, 2017; no limits were included for publication year or the language of publication. The search consisted of titles and abstracts and used the following search string: (amphetamine [MESH term] OR

methylphenidate [MESH term]) AND (cellular OR receptor binding OR neuroimaging OR

FMRI OR SPECT OR PET OR positron emission tomography OR magnetic resonance OR tomography OR spectroscopy) AND (dopamine OR serotonin OR norepinephrine OR acetylcholine OR glutamate OR opioid OR opiate) NOT (methamphetamine OR MDMA OR ecstasy OR addiction OR abuse). The literature search included both animal and human studies.

Additional articles of interest were obtained via an assessment of the relevant articles obtained through the literature review and based on author knowledge. A publication was excluded if it did not specifically focus on the mechanism of action or pharmacologic effects of AMP or MPH or if it was an imaging study in individuals who were other than healthy (ie, studies in those with psychiatric disorders were not included).

3.0 Results

The literature search yielded 673 articles (Figure 2). Of these, 137 were considered

relevant to the topic of this review. Additional articles (n=13) were identified based on author

knowledge and assessment of the reference sections of relevant citations. The articles included in this review are summarized in Table 1 (42-191).

3.7 Preclinical Studies

3.1.1 Amphetamine

The main mechanism of action of AMP is to increase synaptic extracellular DA and NE

levels (44, 52, 59, 60, 67, 68, 71, 78, 80, 85, 87, 94, 105, 107, 128). This effect is mediated by

inhibition of DA transporters (DAT) and NE transporters (NET) (44, 52, 58), which reduces the

reuptake of these molecules from the synapse. In wild-type mice, AMP initially increases surface trafficking of DAT and DA uptake, but continued AMP exposure results in decreased surface expression of the DAT and decreases in DA uptake (49). In a dose-dependent and region-specific

manner, AMP also increases vesicular DA release via inhibition of the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT-2), which releases DA from vesicular storage, and the concomitant release of cytosolic DA via reverse transport by the DAT (58, 88, 99). Furthermore, AMP inhibits

monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity (79, 90), which decreases cytosolic monoamine breakdown. A wide array of studies using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) have demonstrated that AMP produced reductions in the

binding potential of ligands for DA receptors (42, 46, 47, 51, 53, 55, 61, 62, 65, 74-76, 80, 82, 91, 94, 95, 101-104) and NE receptors (59, 73), which is an indirect indicator of increased competition for binding sites resulting from increased extracellular DA or NE. The striatum, which contains most of the DATs in the brain (192, 193), appears to be a principal site of action of AMP (44, 194), but direct effects in the cortex and the ventral tegmental area have also been

reported (85, 87, 195). The effects of AMP extend to and are modulated by other

neurotransmitter systems (50, 56, 66, 70, 77, 85, 86, 89, 96, 98, 106, 108), including ACPI, 5-HT, opioid, and GLU, either directly through enhanced release from presynaptic terminals or via downstream effects.

In other studies, AMP has been shown to produce changes at a more global level. In studies of cerebral blood flow (CBF), AMP increased whole brain CBF in rats and baboons (48,

69, 84, 92), with changes in CBF being correlated with striatal DA concentration (69). In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study in rats, AMP caused widespread increases

in blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal intensity in subcortical structures with rich DA

innervation and with decreases in BOLD signal in the superficial layers of the cortex (54). In another fMRI study in rats, AMP reduced BOLD signal intensity in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex and increased signal intensity in the motor cortex of rats, with signal intensity changes in the nucleus accumbens and caudate (but not in the motor cortex) being attenuated by pretreatment with a tyrosine-free amino acid mixture (83). 3.1.2 Methylphenidate

The direct effects of MPH include inhibition of the DAT and NET (113, 114, 118, 120,

123, 128), an affinity for and agonist activity at the 5-HTia receptor (119, 120), and redistribution of VMAT-2 (88, 125). As a consequence of these interactions, MPH elevates extracellular DA and NE levels (58, 71, 94, 107). The enhanced efflux of DA and NE associated with MPH exposure results in increased availability of DA and NE to bind to their respective transporters (ie, the DAT or NET) or to DA or NE receptors, as evidenced by reductions in

ligand binding in PET and SPECT studies (112, 113, 117, 122-124, 127).

Although increases in extracellular levels of striatal DA in rats measured using microdialysis are less pronounced with MPH than with AMP, both compounds have been shown to exhibit similar magnitude of effects with regard to reductions in DA binding potential as measured by PET in rodents and nonhuman primates (94). Multiple studies have demonstrated that MPH also directly interacts with adrenergic receptors (109, 115, 119, 120). Through activation of a2 adrenergic receptors, MPH has been demonstrated to stimulate cortical excitability (109). Further evidence for the interaction of MPH with oo adrenergic receptors comes from data indicating that the procognitive effects of MPH in a working memory task are blocked by the oo adrenergic antagonist idazoxan (115). The effects ofMPH on oo adrenergic

receptors are notable given that two 012 adrenergic receptor agonist drugs (extended-release forms of guanfacine and clonidine) are indicated for the treatment of ADHD (196).

3.2 Human Neuroimaging Studies

3.2.1 Amphetamine

Reductions in ligand binding in PET (130-132, 134, 136, 144-146, 148-154, 157, 159,

161, 162, 164) and SPECT (140, 142, 143, 156) studies in healthy humans indicate that AMP

increases DA release across multiple brain regions, including the dorsal and ventral striatum, substantia nigra, and regions of the cortex. AMP also has been shown to alter regional CBF to areas of the brain with DA innervation, including the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex,

prefrontal and parietal cortex, inferior orbital cortex, thalamus, cerebellum, and amygdala (135,

155, 156, 160, 163). The effects of AMP on regional CBF appear to be dependent on the dose, with lower doses decreasing rates of blood flow in the frontal and temporal cortices and in the striatum (163) and higher doses increasing blood flow in the anterior cingulate cortex, caudate

nucleus, putamen, and thalamus (160). In fMRI studies in healthy adults, AMP increased BOLD signal variability (137) and exerted an “equalizing” effect on ventral striatum activity during

incentive processing (141). In addition, AMP was shown to strengthen amygdalar responses during the processing of angry and fearful facial expressions (139).

Changes in neuronal activity have been shown to correlate with various behavioral traits

(131, 136, 144, 164). In PET studies, changes in the binding potential of [^CJraclopride (a D2

receptor antagonist) in regions of the ventral striatum of healthy adults associated with AMP

binding have been reported to be negatively correlated with changes in AMP-associated euphoria

(136) and with increases in drug wanting and novelty seeking (144).

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD

Methylphenidate has also been shown to increase striatal DA availability, as measured by

reductions in ligand binding potential in PET studies (165, 166, 170, 178, 179, 181, 182, 187,

190, 191), with evidence to indicate that this effect is related to binding to the DAT (185, 186,

188). MPH-induced reductions in striatal pCJraclopride binding were associated with MPH-

induced changes in euphoria and anxiety and were correlated to age (181, 182). In addition, NE systems have been implicated as key targets for MPH, with MPH dose-dependently blocking the

NET in the thalamus and other NET-rich regions; the estimated occupancy of the NET at therapeutic doses of 0.35 to 0.55 mg/kg MPH is 70% to 80% (168).

Assessments of functional activity using fMRI have provided evidence for the widespread functional effects of MPH (167, 171-173, 177, 180). Using fMRI, it has been shown that MPH increases activation of the parietal and prefrontal cortices and increases deactivation of the insula and posterior cingulate cortex during visual attention and working memory tasks

(180). Another fMRI study reported MPH-induced activation in the putamen during a go/no-go task when a response inhibition error occurred but not when a response was successfully

inhibited (167), suggesting that the effects of MPH are context dependent. Furthermore, MPH exposure altered connectivity strength across various cortical and subcortical networks (172) and shifted brain activation under conditions of uncertainty to higher levels of activation in left and

right parahippocampal regions and cerebellar regions (177). Lastly, MPH-associated decreases in task-related errors on the Stroop color-word task were associated with concurrent decreases in anterior cingulate cortex activity (171). MPH has also been shown to reduce regional CBF in the

prefrontal cortex and increase regional CBF in the thalamus and precentral gyrus (176). In another study that used functional near-infrared spectroscopy, MPH-associated improvements in

in the right lateral prefrontal cortex, which is a surrogate for decreased neural activation (174).

4.0 Discussion

Although their mechanisms of action differ, the primary central nervous system effects of AMP and MPH within the brain include increased catecholamine availability in striatal and cortical regions, as evidenced in preclinical (44, 52, 58-60, 67, 68, 71, 78, 80, 85, 87, 94, 105,

107, 128) and human (130-132, 134, 136, 140, 142-146, 148-154,156,157,159, 161, 162,164-

166, 170, 178, 179, 181, 182, 187, 190, 191) studies. These increases in DA and NE availability affect corticostriatal systems that subserve behaviors related to cognition and executive function

(171, 177, 180), risky decision making (151), emotional responsivity (139), and the regulation of reward processes (197). Importantly, ADHD has been associated with structural and functional alterations in regions of the brain where AMP and MPH have been shown to alter DA and NE activity.

4.7 Structural Alterations in ADHD

A meta-analysis of imaging data from individuals with ADHD across all age groups revealed altered white matter integrity in diverse brain areas, including the striatum and the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes (198). In a meta-analysis of imaging data from children and adults (199), global gray matter volume was significantly smaller in those with ADHD, especially in basal ganglia structures integral to executive function. In adults with ADHD, reduced gray matter volume in the caudate and parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, inferior parietal lobe, anterior cingulate cortex, putamen, and cerebellum were observed: increased volume was noted in other parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobe

(200). A meta-analysis of 1713 persons with ADHD and 1529 controls found volumetric reductions in the accumbens, amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, and putamen (201).

In a meta-analysis of 9 PET and SPECT studies, which included 169 patients with ADHD and 173 healthy controls, it was reported that striatal DAT density in patients with ADHD was 14% higher than in healthy controls (202). Meta-regression analysis further revealed that previous exposure to ADHD medication influenced striatal DAT density, with lower DAT density being associated with a lack of medication exposure (202). As the correlation between medication exposure and striatal DAT density accounted for 48% of the variance across studies

(202), it was suggested that the higher striatal DAT density in individuals with ADHD was a neuroadaptive response to stimulant exposure.

4.2 Functional Alterations in ADHD

A meta-analysis of imaging data focusing specifically on timing function, which is

important for impulsiveness in ADHD, showed consistent deficits in the left inferior prefrontal, parietal, and cerebellar regions of individuals with ADHD (203). A meta-analysis of 24 taskrelated fMRI studies coupled with functional decoding based on the BrainMap database reported hypoactivation in the left putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, and right caudate of

individuals with ADHD (204). When examining these deficits in regard to the BrainMap database, it was suggested that individuals with ADHD may exhibit deficits in the cognitive aspects of music, perception and audition, speech and language, and executive function (204).

In high-functioning, drug-naive young adults with ADHD, resting-state fMRIs revealed altered connectivity in the orbitofrontal-temporal-occipitaI and frontal-amygdala-occipital networks (relating to inattentive and hyperactive/impuIsive symptoms, respectively) compared with matched controls: these abnormalities were not related to developmental delays, impaired

cognition, or use of pharmacotherapy (205). Imaging studies have also reported hypoactivity in the prefrontal cortex and weak connections to other brain regions in individuals with ADHD

(206) . A review of progress in neuroimaging indicated that the initial focus on frontostriatal

dysfunction has given way to a broader understanding of the complex interactions of various

regions of the brain in which alterations may contribute to ADHD symptoms across the life span

(207) .

A substantial body of literature has examined the role of DA systems in the neurobiology

of ADHD and ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors. Among treatment-naive adolescents with ADHD, DAT density shows a significant inverse relationship with blood flow in the cingulate

cortex, the frontal and temporal lobes, and the cerebellum, brain regions which are involved in

modulating attention (208). In a PET study of treatment-naive men with ADHD and men without ADHD, more pronounced reductions in AMP-induced reductions in striatal [nC]raclopride

binding were associated with worse response inhibition, and those with ADHD had the highest-

magnitude reductions and AMP-induced reductions in striatal [nC]raclopride binding (209). TwoSPECT studies and 1 PET study showed that adults with ADHD had higher DAT

concentrations than adults without ADHD (210-212), with the SPECT studies further reporting that MPH reduced DAT availability in adults with ADHD (210, 211). Furthermore, studies have

shown significant correlations between global clinical improvement in ADHD symptoms following MPH treatment and striatal DAT availability (213, 214), and the MPH-induced

increases in DA availability in the ventral striatum are associated with improved ADHD

symptomology in adults with ADHD (215). In another study, in adults with ADHD, long-term

MPH treatment increased striatal DAT availability (216). In another PET study in adults with ADHD, decreased DAT and D2/D3 receptor availability in the nucleus accumbens and midbrain

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD Compared with Individuals without ADHD Was Reported, and Reduced Availability of DAT and

D2/D3 receptor availability was significantly correlated with lower indices of motivation only in those with ADHD (217). Also, a PET study in young male adults with ADHD has also reported dysfunctional DA metabolism in the putamen, amygdala, and dorsal midbrain relative to healthy controls regardless of treatment status (naive vs previously treated with MPH) and that a history of MPH treatment resulted in a down-regulation of DA turnover (218). Despite the neuroimaging evidence that supports a role for the DAT in adult ADHD, a systematic literature review examining the pharmacogenetics of adult ADHD found that only 1 of 5 identified studies

reported finding a polymorphism at the DAT gene associated with ADHD (219).

Studies of NET availability have not consistently reported altered NET availability in

individuals with ADHD (220, 221), but one study reported genotype-dependent increases in NET

binding in the thalamus and cerebellum of adults with ADHD compared with controls; this effect was largely due to the effect of NET gene polymorphisms on NET binding potential (220). Another study reported no NET differences across multiple brain regions, including the

hippocampus, thalamus, and midbrain, in individuals with ADHD compared with controls (221).

Beyond the changes observed in DA and NE systems in individuals with ADHD, there is evidence that GLU, 5-HT, ACH, and opioid systems play a role in ADHD. Studies examining

neurometabolism using proton MRIs have reported glutamatergic deficits in the frontal cortical and striatal regions in individuals with ADHD that may be related to cognitive control and symptom severity (12, 222, 223). Regarding the 5-HT systems, it has been reported that

increased methylation of the 5-HT transporter is associated with worse clinical presentation and

reduced cortical thickness in children with ADHD (224). In adults, significant differences in 5-

HT transporter interregional correlations between the precuneus and hippocampus have been

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD Reported in Adults with ADHD Compared with Controls without ADHD (225). Functionally, it Has Been Reported That Decreased Levels of Activation Are Observed in the Precuneus of Adolescents with ADHD Compared with Individuals without ADHD: However, There is a Significantly Greater Increase in the Activation of the Precuneus Following the Administration of Fluoxetine in Adolescents with ADHD Compared with Controls (226). At Present, There Are No Published Neuroimaging Studies of Endogenous Opioid or ACH Systems in Individuals with ADHD. However, Altered Function in Both Systems Has Been Implicated in ADHD (13, 14). 4.3 Co-occurring Psychiatric Conditions and ADHD

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is often associated with comorbid psychiatric disorders (16-18), such as anxiety and mood disorders. Importantly, the same brain regions and neurotransmitter systems that underlie ADHD are also implicated in the psychiatric disorders that are frequently comorbid with ADHD (19-21). Thus, it is important to understand how ADHD therapies might influence psychiatric comorbidities. 4.3.1 Anxiety disorders

In healthy human volunteers, AMP has been reported to potentiate amygdalar activity in response to the processing of angry and fearful facial expressions (139). These data provide a potential neurobiologic basis for the anxiogenic effects of AMP (139). However, it has been theorized that stimulant-associated augmentation of serotonergic drive could ameliorate the comorbid anxiety associated with ADHD (227). In practice, the effects of stimulants on anxiety can be complex, with acute administration of MPH reducing anxiety in adults and chronic treatment during early life increasing anxiety during adulthood (228). 4.3.2 Depressive disorders

Psychostimulants have been used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) since the early 1950s, when the use of MPH was first examined for MDD (229). The rationale for examining the potential utility of psychostimulants in depressive disorders is based on preclinical and clinical evidence implicating DA in depressive symptomatology (230). However, the rapid onset of action of psychostimulants suggests the mechanisms by which they may

influence depressive symptoms is likely to differ from that of antidepressants (231).

Based on the published literature, the effects of psychostimulants on depressive symptoms appear equivocal. Although one meta-analysis published in 2008 based on 3 short­ term trials reported statistically significant improvements favoring monotherapy with psychostimulants compared with placebo for depressive symptoms (232), a systematic review of augmentation therapy for MDD published in 2009 based on MPH (2 studies) and modafinil (2 studies) reported that neither augmentation strategy was clinically superior to antidepressant monotherapy in reducing depressive symptoms (233). In addition, 2 large phase 3 studies and a phase 2 study of Iisdexamfetamine dimesylate augmentation in adults with MDD and inadequate response to antidepressant therapy failed to meet their primary efficacy endpoint versus placebo

(234, 235). The lack of treatment effect in these recently published studies, taken together with

inconsistent findings based on meta-analyses and systematic reviews, suggests that psychostimulants are ineffective in treating the undifferentiated symptoms of depression.

Psychostimulants have also been examined in other mood disorders, including treatmentresistant depression, bipolar depression, and depression associated with specific medical conditions (236). For bipolar depression, there is some evidence supporting the efficacy of psychostimulant augmentation, but the quality and quantity of studies does not allow for a strong evidence-based recommendation for their use to be put forth (236).

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD

Despite inconclusive evidence regarding the efficacy of psychostimulants in treating depressive symptoms, the continued publication of review articles on this topic (231, 237, 238) demonstrates continued interest in this area of research. These review articles hypothesize that the lack of consistent clinical efficacy of psychostimulant augmentation could be due to poorly defined psychopathology and that psychostimulant effects may be more pronounced in selected symptom domains (237, 238) or that the effects of psychostimulants are short-lasting (231). It

has also been speculated that the use of clinician-rated scales (rather than patient-rated scales) in some studies (234, 235) may not have adequately captured the effects of psychostimulant treatment.

It should also be noted that the use of stimulants as augmentation agents in combination with tricyclic antidepressants and MAO inhibitors is controversial, with issues concerning the

possible development of an adrenergic crisis, the emergence of serotonin syndrome, or a

hypertensive crisis being raised (239). In fact, both MPH-based agents and AMP-based agents are contraindicated in individuals taking an MAO inhibitor (currently or within the preceding 2 weeks) because a hypertensive crisis may result (240).

4.3.3 Substance use disorders

The neurobiology of reward and addiction and the key role of mesolimbic DA systems

have been described in great detail (241, 242). Although associations have been made between ADHD and substance abuse, their relationship is complex. Several reviews have emphasized that substance use disorders can be comorbid with ADHD (16, 17). For example, in a study of 208 adults diagnosed with ADHD and treated with psychostimulants as youths, the relative risk of

having a diagnosis of substance use disorder or alcohol abuse, respectively, compared with the

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD General Population Was 7.7 or 5.2 (243). Furthermore, a 2012 Review Noted That There Was Evidence for Increased Rates of Substance Abuse in Individuals with ADHD Treated with

psychostimulants (244). Given the known abuse liability of psychostimulants and data indicating that psychostimulant medications are associated with misuse and diversion (245, 246), it is not surprising that psychostimulant medications approved for use in ADHD are schedule II

medications with black box warnings for potential drug dependence (247). Some treatment guidelines suggest that nonstimulant alternatives be considered as therapies for ADHD when

issues related to abuse and dependence are a concern (25, 28, 248).

However, multiple studies have provided evidence that psychostimulant treatment in

individuals with substance use disorders and ADHD is not associated with a significant worsening of substance abuse (249, 250). In a study that examined the efficacy of extended -

release mixed AMP salts in the treatment of ADHD symptoms and cocaine abuse in 126 cocaine-dependent adults with ADHD (250), significantly greater reductions in ADHD symptoms and higher abstinence from cocaine use were observed with extended-release mixed AMP salts than placebo. In another study, osmotic-control led release oral delivery system

(OROS) MPH did not produce significantly greater reductions in ADHD symptoms than placebo

in 24 AMP-dependent adults with newly diagnosed ADHD. However, OROS MPH treatment also was not associated with evidence of increased AMP abuse, as measured by self-reported days of AMP use or craving for AMP, time to relapse, or cumulative abstinence duration (249). 4.3.4 Sleep disturbances

The neurobiologic substrates of sleep are diverse and distributed throughout the brain, with monoaminergic systems playing an important role in wakefulness (21). Substantial

literature exists regarding the sleep disturbances associated with ADHD, which include

insomnia, disordered sleep, difficulty falling asleep, sleep apnea, daytime somnolence, and

increased nocturnal motor activity (see (18, 251-253) for reviews). Evidence suggests that

impaired and/or disordered sleep is present in individuals not being treated with

psychostimulants (18). For example, in a study of the effects of MPH on sleep in children with ADHD, parents reported that approximately 10% of study participants had sleep problems before starting their medication (254). However, in regard to the reported effects of psychostimulants on sleep in individuals with ADHD, there are some discrepancies. In a meta-analysis of 9 articles, the use of psychostimulant medication was associated with longer sleep latency, worse sleep efficiency, and shorter sleep duration (255). A review of the safety and tolerability of ADHD

medications noted that insomnia was one of the most commonly reported adverse events associated with psychostimulant treatment (36). In contrast, some studies have shown that

psychostimulants have no significant negative impact on sleep (254, 256, 257). A post hoc analysis of the effects of lisdexamfetamine or SHP465 mixed amphetamine salts in adults with ADHD demonstrated that the proportions of participants exhibiting a worsening of sleep during treatment, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, did not differ from that of placebo

(257). Discrepancies in the effects of stimulants on sleep in individuals with ADHD might be attributable to various factors, including sleep quality prior to treatment, the stimulant formulation, the length of treatment, and the method of sleep assessment (251,254, 255). For example, in a study of MPH in children with ADHD, 23% of participants without preexisting sleep problems developed sleep problems while taking MPH, whereas 68.5% of those with

preexisting sleep problems no longer experienced sleep problems after taking MPH (254).

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD

In addition to considering the potential effect of AMP and MPH in individuals with other comorbid psychiatric disorders, the peripheral effects of AMP and MPH related to their pharmacology need to be considered, particularly in regard to their effects on cardiovascular function. Increased heart rate and blood pressure are among the most frequent treatmentemergent adverse events reported with psychostimulant treatment (36, 37); increases in pulse and blood pressure are also frequently reported (36, 37, 258). There is also a safety concern related to the potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including ischemic attacks, myocardial

infarction, and stroke (259). In a self-controlled case series analysis, treatment with MPH was associated with an increased overall risk of arrhythmia and with an increased risk of myocardial

infarction from 1 week to 2 months after treatment initiation in children and adolescents with ADHD (260). Another study reported that the risk for an emergency department visit for cardiacrelated reasons among youths did not differ between those being treated with AMP versus MPH

(261). However, these findings should be considered in light of data from 2 large studies that reported no significant increase in risk for cardiovascular events in current users of ADHD medications compared with nonusers (262, 263).

The neurotransmitter systems responsible for stimulant-associated adverse events and safety concerns are in large part related to stimulation of peripheral NE activity (36, 259). Based on these concerns, package inserts for stimulants include black box warnings regarding the potential for serious adverse cardiovascular events (247). Assessments of the risks and benefits of stimulant therapy for ADHD should be made on an individual basis, and individuals on psychostimulant treatment should be monitored.

Another issue of potential concern is the possible neuroinflammatory effects of psychostimulants. In rats, MPH administration has been reported to produce neuroinflammation

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD and Oxidative Stress in the Hippocampus and Cerebral Cortex, as Measured by the Inflammatory Markers Tumor Necrosis Factor a and Interleukin Ip (264, 265). In a Systematic Review of 14 Studies (266), No Study Assessed the Relationship Between Psychostimulant Treatment and Neuroinflammation so the Relevance of Preclinical Models of Neuroinflammation to Psychostimulant Treatment in Individuals with ADHD is Unknown. The Same Review Did Find Evidence Suggesting a Role for Inflammation in the Pathogenesis of ADHD (266), Which is Consistent with a Meta-analysis Finding Elevated Levels of Oxidative Stress in Patients Diagnosed with ADHD (267). Oxidative Stress Has Also Been Implicated in the Lower Brain Volumes Seen in ADHD Patients (268).

5.0 Conclusions

Based on the published literature, the primary pharmacologic effects of both AMP and MPH are related to increased central DA and NE activity in brain regions that include the cortex and striatum. These regions are involved in the regulation of executive and attentional function

(11). In ADHD, dysfunction in the DA and NE systems, which are critical to proper cortical and striatal function, likely account for some of the pathophysiology of ADHD (10, 11,206). Although it is a limitation of the review that the only database searched was PubMed, it is unlikely that important studies were not captured.

It has been speculated that the moderately greater efficacy of AMP-based agents compared with MPH-based agents in ADHD may be related to differences in their molecular actions (33), but to date there is no conclusive clinical evidence to support this speculation.

Furthermore, there is no conclusive clinical evidence supporting a prospective choice for an AMP-based agent over as MPH-based agent (or vice versa) based on the mechanisms of action

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD of These Drug Classes. As Such, the Current Understanding of Differences in the Mechanisms of Action of AMP and MPH Has Not Led to Clinical Guidelines Regarding Their Use in Specific Patient

populations. Furthermore, it is possible that differences in the pharmacologic profile between AMP and MPH, in combination with the complexities associated with the etiology of ADHD

(11), contribute to individual differences in treatment response to AMP-based agents or MPH-

based agents in individuals with ADHD. Interactions among these factors might explain why some patients have a differential response to these drugs.

When contemplating pharmacotherapy for ADHD, in addition to taking into account the

potential for adverse cardiovascular outcomes (259), the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders should be considered. Multiple psychiatric comorbidities, including depression and anxiety (16,17), are thought to be mediated in part by shared neurobiological pathways that are also implicated in the pathophysiology of ADHD (19, 20). As such, the effect of psychostimulant treatment on the symptoms of these disorders and the potential interactions with medications

used to treat these disorders need to be considered.

Figure Legends

Figure 1. Brain Mechanisms in ADHD*

(a) The cortical regions (lateral view) of the brain have a role in attention-deficit/hyperactivity

disorder (ADHD). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is linked to working memory, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex to complex decision making and strategic planning, and the

parietal cortex to orientation of attention, (b) ADHD involves the subcortical structures (medial view) of the brain. The ventral anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex

subserve affective and cognitive components of executive control. Together with the basal

ganglia (comprising the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, and putamen), they form the frontostriataI circuit. Neuroimaging studies show structural and functional abnormalities in all of these structures in patients with ADHD, extending into the amygdala and cerebellum, (c)

Neurotransmitter circuits in the brain are involved in ADHD. The dopamine system plays an

important part in planning and initiation of motor responses, activation, switching, reaction to

novelty, and processing of reward. The noradrenergic system influences arousal modulation,

signal-to-noise ratios in cortical areas, state-dependent cognitive processes, and cognitive

preparation of urgent stimuli, (d) Executive control networks are affected in patients with ADHD. The executive control and cortico-cerebellar networks coordinate executive functioning

(ie, planning, goal-directed behavior, inhibition, working memory, and the flexible adaptation to

context). These networks are underactivated and have lower internal functional connectivity in

individuals with ADHD compared with individuals without the disorder, (e) ADHD involves the

reward network. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontaI cortex, and ventral striatum

are at the center of the brain network that responds to anticipation and receipt of reward. Other

# Neuropharmacology of ADHD Structures Involved Are the Thalamus, the Amygdala, and the Cell Bodies of Dopaminergic Neurons in the Substantia Nigra, Which, as Indicated by the Arrows, Interact in a Complex Manner. Behavioral and Neural Responses to Reward Are Abnormal in ADHD, (f) The Alerting Network is Impaired in ADHD. The Frontal and Parietal Cortical Areas and the Thalamus Intensively Interact in the Alerting Network (indicated by the arrows), Which Supports Attentional Functioning and is Weaker in Individuals with ADHD Than in Controls, (g) ADHD Involves the Default-mode Network (DMN). The DMN Consists of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex and the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (medial view) as Well as the Lateral Parietal Cortex and the Medial Temporal Lobe (lateral view). DMN Fluctuations Are 180° Out of Phase with Fluctuations in Networks That Become Activated During Externally Oriented Tasks, Presumably Reflecting Competition Between Opposing Processes for Processing Resources. Negative Correlations Between the DMN and the Frontoparietal Control Network Are Weaker in Patients with ADHD Than in People Who Do Not Have the Disorder. *Reprinted with Permission From Macmillan Publishers Ltd: [NAT REV DIS PRIMERS] (Faraone SV, Asherson P, Banaschewski T, Biederman J, Buitelaar JK, Ramos-Quiroga JA, Et Al.
