Mechanisms of neurotransmitter release by amphetamines: A review

# David Sulzera,b’*, Mark S. Sondersb’c, Nathan W. Poulsen B, Aurelio Gallid

Amphetamine and substituted amphetamines, including methamphetamine, methylphenidate (Ritalin), methylenedioxymethampheta­ mine (ecstasy), and the herbs khat and ephedra, encompass the only widely administered class of drugs that predominantly release neurotransmitter, in this case principally catecholamines, by a  non-exocytic mechanism. These drugs play important medicinal and social roles in many cultu res, exert profound e ffects on mental fun ction and behavior, and can produce neurodegeneration a nd addiction. Numerous

questions remain regarding the unusual molecular mechanisms by which these compounds induce catecholamine release. We review current issues on the two apparent primary mechanisms—the redistribution of catecholamines from synaptic vesicles to the cytosol, and induction of reverse transport of transmitter through plasma membrane uptake carriers—and on additional drug effects that affect extracellular

**I. Introduction: what is an amphetamine?**

Amphetamine (AMPH) (1; see Fig. 1 for enumerated chemical structures) and its many derivatives are so varied in structure and effects that they could be considered the orchids of the psychoactive drugs. This review addresses the multiple mechanisms of action that underlie these compounds’ most prominent and paradigmatic biological effect—to elevate extracellular levels of catecholamines and serotonin via a mechanism that is independent of the classical means of transmitter release by secretory vesicle fusion. We review current ideas within a  historical context to help frame future research on this rewarding but addictive, popular but despised, beneficial and destructive class of drugs. Alexander Shulgin (1978), a specialist in psychomimetic phenethylamines, states that “the name amphetamine designates one unique chemical and there can be no justification for its use in the plural”; nevertheless, the plural is destined to survive until the language evolves, as the generic names for many compounds that contain the AMPH structure also include the term. For the purposes of this review, we cautiously define “the amphetamines” to follow the rules implied by the generic name of the wr-compound as sharing an a-methyl-phenethyl-amine motif. The chemists J. H. Biel and B.A. Bopp (1978) state the definitive structural features of AMPH as (1) an unsubstituted phenyl ring, (2) a two-carbon side chain between the phenyl ring and nitrogen, (3) an a-methyl group, and (4) a  primary amino group. The most studied such compounds, AMPH and methampheta­ mine (METH) **(2),** are addressed most specifically in this article (although METH does not obey the fourth rule, having a  secondary amine). While both compounds are stellar examples of catecholamine releasers, they simplify our review by having little affinity for neuronal receptors (although see Section 6.4). This article is not intended to review data that compare how chemical substitutions to AMPH alter the drugs’ efficacy in relation to each mechanism, an enormous subject [see an excellent review by David Nichols, 1994]. For purposes of comparison, we nevertheless sometimes discuss chain-substituted ampheta­

mines, such as methylphenidate (3), and ring substituted

amphetamines, such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethampheta-

mine (MDMA: ecstasy) (4), as well as non-a-methylated

phenethylamines, such as tyramine **(5)** or mescaline **(6)**

(both of which also have ring substitutions).

It is often asked if AMPH and METH differ in effect. The

two drugs show no differences in terms of changes in

dopamine release in the striatum, elimination rates, or other

pharmacokinetic properties (Melega et al., 1995), and equal

doses of the two drugs are not distinguished in human

discrimination studies (Lamb and Henningfield, 1994).

There is, however, a  subtly greater dopamine release by

AMPH than METH in the prefrontal cortex, and likely as a

result, some subtle differences in effects of the drugs on

working memory and behavioral tolerance (Shoblock et al.,

2003a, 2003b). AMPH can elicit somewhat more locomotor

activity in rodents than METH, perhaps due to indirect

effects (Shoblock et al., 2003a). The occasional statement in

the literature that METH is more addictive, favored by drug

addicts, a  more potent psychostimulant, or has diminished

peripheral activity appears to be unfounded (Shoblock et al.,

2003a). By tradition, studies on mechanisms of action are

generally on AMPH, and studies of neurodegeneration on

METH. This may be because METH is more readily

available on the illicit market due to its easier synthesis,

which uses either a  one-step reduction of ephedrine (7) or

pseudoephedrine, drugs that at this writing remain readily

available, or a  condensation of phenylacetone and methy­

lamine (Cho, 1990). Because ephedrine is a  stereochemi-

cally pure natural product, the first method of METH

manufacture yields only the more active S(+)-enantiomer

(Section 5.2).

products  for  thousands  of  years.  The  principal  species  so used  are  members  of  the  genus Ephedra  and  the  tree Catha 

edulis,   known  in  Arabic  and  Swahili  as khat  (qaf)  and  over 

much of East Africa as myrrha (miraa).

Ephedra  sinica,  often  known  simply  as  ephedra  and  in 

China  as Ma  huang  (“looking  for  trouble”),  has  been recovered  from  Middle  Eastern  Neolithic  gravesites  and 

Vedic  temples  in  India.  The  herb  has  been  identified,  although 

controversially,  as soma,  the  food  of  the  Vedic  gods 

(Mahdihassan  and  Mehdi,  1989). A  first  century  AD  Chinese book  of  herbal  medicine, Shen  Nong  Ben,  mentions  its  use  for treating  asthma  and  upper  respiratory  infections.  The  major 

active  component,  ephedrine **(7),** was  identified  in  1887  by Nagajoshi  Nagai,  a  founder  of  the  Pharmaceutical  Society  of Japan.  In  the  western  United  States,  a  stimulant  tea  was brewed  from  a  different Ephedra  species,  the  herb  Mormon Tea (E. nevadensis), so called  because it was  not proscribed by the  Church  of  Jesus  Christ  of  Latter-day  Saints,  although  a recent  report  suggests  that  New  World Ephedra  lacks phenethylamine-related  alkaloids  (Caveney  et  al.,  2001). 

Over-the-counter  ephedrine  has  been  a  popular  appetite 

suppressant and  widely used  by athletes  to boost  performance. 

It  was  implicated  in  the  death  of  Baltimore  Orioles  pitcher 

Steve Bechler  in February  2003 and  was banned  from use  as a 

dietary  supplement  on  the  American  market  by  the  FDA  in April  2004.  Today,  ephedrine  and  pseudoephedrine **(8)** are  the 

most  common  precursors  for  amateur  laboratories  that produce METH for the illicit market (Section 1).

The fresh  leaves of  the shrub  or tree Catha edulis, native  to 

Kenya  and  Somalia  and  widely  cultivated  in  Yemen,  contain the  amphetamines  cathinone  (9)  and  norpseudoephedrine 

(cathine) **(10).** The  leaves’  clinical  use  was  reported  in  the 

11th  century  by  Abu  Al-Rihan  Bin  Ahmed  Al-Baironi  in Pharmacy  and  Therapeutic  Art (Al-Motarreb  et  al.,  2002). The  fresh  leaves  or  stems  are  chewed,  as  the  stored  product racemizes  and  loses  activity.  Khat  is  not  proscribed  by  the 

Koran  and  is  common  from  the  Hom  of  Africa  through  the Middle  East.  The  herb  is  used  by  an  estimated  55%  of  the population  of  northern  Somalia (Elmi,  1983) and  as  many  as 

85%  of  adult  males  in  North  Yemen (Pantelis  etal.,  1989), and represents  30%  of  Yemen’s  agricultural  product (Al-Motarreb 

et  al.,  2002). It  is  associated  with  gregariousness,  feelings  of 

contentment,  suppression  of  fatigue,  and  appetite  loss.  Khat  is habit  forming,  induces  paranoia  and  other  behavioral 

disturbances (Jager  and  Sireling,  1994;  Yousef  et  al., 

1995), but  is  said  to  produce  relatively  benign  withdrawal 

symptoms.  Khat  is  incorporated  into  fascinating  and  complex 

social  rituals,  particularly  in  Yemen,  where  homes  may 

maintain  two  separate  rooms  devoted  to  khat  chewing,  the 

mandher,  a  small  upper  story  room  with  many  windows,  and  a 

dewan   for  large  social  gatherings (Al-Motarreb  et  al.,  2002). There  is  a  suspicion  expressed  in  Kenya  that  long-term  khat 

addicts  have  motor  deficits  (personal  communication),  but this  has  not  been  studied  systematically. (Myrrha,  as  the  plant is  known  in  Kenya,  should  not  be  confused  with  myrrh,  one  of the gifts to Jesus by Zoroastrian magi (Matthew 2:11). Myrrh

is  derived  from Commiphora  myrrha,  a  different  tree  native  to Kenya  and  Somalia,  a  region  also  native  to  the  tree  that provides frankincense, Boswellia sacra.)

While  additional  plant  species  contain  natural  ampheta­ mines,  including  AMPH  and  METH  in  Acacia  species 

(Clement  et  al.,  1998) and  AMPH  in  Egyptian  jasmine (Nofal et  al.,  1982), we  are  not  aware  of  other  plants  commonly  used to  administer  these  drugs.  There  are,  however,  plant  products with  components  similar  to  amphetamines.  Synephrine,  a 

sympathomimetic  AMPH  congener  lacking  an  a-methyl group,  is  found  in  citrus  plants  including Citrus  aurantium, bitter  orange (Pellati  et  al.,  2002). The  world’s  most  widely used  psychostimulant  is  said  to  be  arecoline,  the  principal active com pound i n t he betel nut pal m Areca cat echu, w hich is consumed  by  10-20%  of  the  world’s  population (Gupta  and Wamakulasuriya,  2002). (N.B.,  caffeine  and  nicotine  do  not enhance  locomotor  behavior  in  rodents  and are  not  considered psychostimulants.)  In  addition  to  arecoline,  which  is  not  a phenethylamine,  some  phenethylamine-like  compounds  are present in  the betel  nut and  flower, the  ingredients of  the paste known  as  betel quid.  While  used  experimentally  as  a muscarinic  agonist,  the  psychostimulant  mechanism  of  action of betel  has been  little studied,  although it  has been  reported to produce  AMPH-like  catecholamine  release (Wang  and Hwang, 1997; Chu, 2002).

Another  phenethylamine  analog,  mescaline **(6),** derived from  dried  tops  of  the  peyote  cactus Lophophora  williamsii and  related  species,  avoids  classification  as  an  amphetamine due  to  lack  of  an  a-methyl  group.  This  plant  appears  in Native  American  funerary  art  of  2000  years  ago (Furst, 

1972), and  its  use  by  the  Aztecs  for  predicting  the  future  and other  practices  was  discussed  by  F.  Hernandez,  the  Spanish king’s  personal  physician,  in Nova  Plantarum,  Animalium  et Mineralium  Mexicanorum  Historia  in  1576.  Its  ongoing  use by  Tarahumara  and  Huichol  Indians  in  Mexico  preceded  the European  invasion.  Around  1880  it  was  incorporated  by more  northern  tribes  into  the  rituals  of  the  Native  American Church,  a  religion  that  includes  about  200,000  adherents  of mostly  Plains  Indians,  and  for  whom  religious  use  of  peyote has  been  protected  by  Federal  law  since  1965,  most 

specifically  by  the  American  Indian  Religious  Freedom  Act Amendments  of  1994.  There  are  no  reports  of  neurotoxicity, overdose,  or  drug  dependence  from  peyote (McCann  and Ricaurte,  1994), and  the  mechanism  of  action  of  this  drug  is quite  different  than  that  of  amphetamines (Nichols,  1994; 

Schmidt,  1994), although  mescaline  has  inspired  the 

synthesis of numerous AMPH derivatives (Section 2.4).

2.2. Endogenous AMPH-like compounds?

It  has  long  been  known  that  decarboxylated  metabolites of  the  aromatic  amino  acids  —  P-phenethylamine **(11)** from phenylalanine,  its  metabolite  phenylethanolamine **(12),** tyramine  (5)  from  tyrosine,  and  tryptamine  from  tryptophan —  are  formed  in  the  peripheral  nervous  system (Nakajima et  al.,  1964) and  the  brain (Inwang  et  al.,  1973). These 

compounds  have  been  suggested  to  modulate  affective 

behaviors  including  excitement  and  alertness,  are  decreased 

in  the  urine  of  depressed  patients (Sabelli  and  Mosnaim, 

1974) and  are  elevated  by  marijuana (Cannabis  sativa) 

(Sabelli  et  al.,  1974). These  “trace  amines,”  however,  do  not 

appear  to  be  stored  in  substantial  quantity  in  either  the 

central nervous system or periphery (Berry, 2004).

Trace  amines  share  with  AMPH  several  mechanisms  of 

action  and  could  possibly  act  as  endogenous  amphetamines. 

High  levels  of  P-phenethylamine  applied  exogenously  or 

reached  during  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  inhibition  elicit 

AMPH-like  psychostimulant  responses (B  ergman  et  al.,  2001). 

Eike  AMPH,  it  releases  dopamine  in  a  manner  dependent  on 

the  presence  of  an  intact  dopamine  transporter  (DAT)  (Section 

5.3) as  assayed  using  cyclic  voltammetry  and  microdialysis  in 

wild-type  and  DAT  knockout  mice (Sotnikova  et  al.,  2004), 

although  a  subset  of  behavioral  responses  to  the  compound 

were found to be independent of the presence of DAT.

It  remains  to  be  determined  if  P-phenethylamine  is  a 

neurotransmitter  or  released  in  a  regulated  fashion;  at  least 

when  present  in  high  levels,  it  would  likely  be  transported 

into  synaptic  vesicles (Niddam  et  al.,  1985) by  the  vesicular 

monoamine  transporter.  Other  studies,  however,  variably 

implicate  release  by  diffusion  across  membranes  rather  than 

reverse  transport  via  catecholamine  transporters  and  in  some 

cases,  insensitivity  to  reserpine  (an  inhibitor  of  vesicular 

catecholamine uptake: Section 3.1) (Berry, 2004).

As  is  the  case  with  mescaline  and  in  contrast  to  AMPH, 

the  trace  amines  lack  the  a-methyl  group  that  inhibits  MAO 

(Section 6.1), and  are  thus  thought  to  be  rapidly  metabolized 

in  the  brain.  It  remains  unknown  if  local  levels  of  p-

phenethylamine  normally  reach  concentrations  that  elicit 

endogenous  AMPH-like  effects,  or  even  reach  levels  that 

significantly  activate  receptors,  although  some  of  the  trace 

amine  compounds  have  very  high  affinity  for  the  recently 

identified trace amine receptors (Section 6.4).

2.3. Synthetic amphetamines

Synthetic  AMPH  was  invented  in  1887  by  Lazar 

Edeleanu  (1862-1941,  a.k.a.  Edeleano),  a  Rumanian 

chemist  who  described  its  synthesis  in  his  doctoral 

dissertation  under  A.W.  Hofmann  at  the  University  of 

Berlin (Edeleano,  1887). Edeleanu  later  became  famous  for 

also  inventing  the  method  to  distill  petroleum  using  sulphur 

dioxide, providing the tell-tale odor of gasoline distilleries.

AMPH  was  bequeathed  its  generic  name  from  a 

contraction  of  a-methyl-phenethyl-amine.  Some  notion  of 

the  colorful  history  of  this  drug  can  be  seen  from  the  1989 

Merck  Index  listing,  which  lists  17  trade  names,  not  even 

including  such  familiar  trade  names  as  Adderall,  Benzedrine, 

and  Dexedrine,  or  for  that  matter  the  myriad  nicknames  used 

by drug  abusers. Of  course, chemists  have since  developed an 

astonishing range of synthetic AMPH derivatives.

Following  work  discussed  below  by  Barger  and  Dale  that 

introduced  the  concept  of  sympathomimetic  amines  (Sec­

tion 3.1), researchers  have  examined  a  wide  range  of catecholamine-like  derivatives  for  the  ability  to  raise  blood pressure  and  to  relieve  nasal  and  bronchial  congestion  from colds  and  hay  fever.  AMPH  was  independently  resynthe­ sized  by  Gordon  Alles  in  1927  in  an  effort  toward developing  synthetic  sympathomimetics,  and  he  and  his coworkers  are  credited  with  the  first  report  of  its  stimulant effects (Alles,  1933). Walter  Hartung  and  James  Munch from  Sharp  &  Dohme  laboratories  identified  AMPH  (called in  that  study  phenyl-2-amino-l-propane)  as  a  particularly efficacious  sympathomimetic,  as  well  as  being  particularly active  when  administered  orally (Hartung  and  Munch, 1931). AMPH  was  introduced  commercially  in  1932  by  the pharmaceutical  firm  Smith,  Kline  and  French  as  Benzedrine, which  was  the  free  base  administered  in  inhaler  form.  The first  report  of  AMPH  use  as  a  clinical  treatment,  for narcolepsy,  is  credited  to  Myron  Prinzmetal,  a  colleague  of Alles (Prinzmetal  and  Bloomberg,  1935). In  1936,  Smith Kline  and  French  began  to  sell  Benzedrine  as  10  mg  tablets without  prescription.  It  is  said  that  the  first  widespread  use  of AMPH  stemmed  from  word-of-mouth  reports  spread  from campus  to  campus  following  experiments  by  the  Department of  Psychology  at  the  University  of  Minnesota  on  alertness  in college  students (Angrist  and  Sudilovsky,  1978). Over  50 million  Benzedrine  tablets  were  sold  during  the  first  3  years of availability. AMPH  was  made  available  by  prescription  only  on January  1,  1939.  Initially  associated  with  students,  and  soon after  with  artists,  musicians,  the  armed  forces,  and  truck drivers,  AMPH’s  popularity  contributed  directly  to  at  least one  deathless  work  of  art,  the  boogie  woogie  “Who  put  the Benzedrine  in  Mrs.  Murphy’s  Ovaltine?”  by  Harry  “the Hipster” Gibson (1944). Until  1946,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  promoted  more than  30  uses  for  AMPH,  including  treatment  of  schizophrenia, opiate  addiction,  infantile  cerebral  palsy,  seasickness,  radia­ tion  sickness,  and  persistent  hiccups (Bett,  1946;  Miller  and Hughes,  1994). By  1970,  annual  pharmaceutical  production reached  10  billion  tablets,  with  perhaps  50-90%  diverted  to  the black  market.  The  United  States  Justice  Department  imposed legal quotas on AMPH production in 1971. AMPH,  METH,  and  methylphenidate  are  still  very widely  prescribed  for  weight  control,  narcolepsy,  and attention  deficit  disorder.  The  latter  disorder  is  a  particular concern,  as  the  National  Institute  of  Mental  Health  estimates that  it  is  exhibited  by  3-5%  of  the  population,  and  the number  of  American  children  treated  with  these  three AMPH  congeners  increased  from  0.6  per  100  to  2.4  per  100 between  1987  and  1996 (Olfson  et  al.,  2002). Adderall,  a mixture  of  S(+)-  and  /?(-)-AMPH,  is  presently  the  most commonly  prescribed  treatment  in  the  United  States  for juvenile  attention  deficit  disorder.  The  mechanism  under­ lying  its  efficacy  remains  obscure,  although  it  has  been suggested  that  it  is  due  to  a  specific  enhancement  of  “tonic” dopaminergic signalling (Knutson et al., 2004).

Beginning  in  the  Spanish  Civil  War,  and  in  all  subsequent wars,  AMPH  has  been  used  by  the  military  to  promote alertness.  Millions  of  tablets  and  pills  were  supplied  to American  troops  during  World  War  II,  and  unknown quantities  were  administered  to  German,  Japanese,  and British  military  and  support  personnel,  in  particular  to  the  air forces  on  long  flights  and  bombing  missions.  This  use remains  current,  especially  for  fighter  pilots  on  long missions (Caldwell  et  al.,  2003), although  it  has  been 

suggested  that  it  causes  hallucinations,  particularly  in  people with  a  common  mutation  in  catecholamine-O-methyl transferase enzyme (Mattay et al., 2003).

An  initial  report  on  AMPH  abuse  and  induction  of psychosis  in  two  cases  soon  followed  its  introduction 

(Young  and  Scoville,  1938), although  this  was  thought  to unmask  a  latent  psychosis.  The  authoritative  documentation of  AMPH  psychosis  is  credited  to  PH.  Connell (Connell, 

1958). The  addictive  potential  of  AMPH  was  mentioned  as early  as  1937 (Guttmann  and  Sargeant,  1937) but  was  a  topic of  much  debate  [see  discussion  in Angrist  and  Sudilovsky, 

1978] and  not  fully  recognized  until  the  mid-1960s (Lemere, 

1966). The  initial  reports  of  central  nervous  system neurotoxicity  induced  by  amphetamines  also  appeared  in the 1960s (Pletscher et al., 1963).

As  with  cocaine,  AMPH  use  tends  to  occur  in  epidemic waves.  A  well-known  example  occurred  in  Japan  from  1947 to  1957,  and  was  associated  with  returning  troops  who  were administered  AMPH,  partly  under  coercion,  along  with large-scale  advertising  of  the  drug  to  the  general  public  from manufacturers.  By  1954,  550,000  Japanese  were  using  the drug  illicitly (Fukui  et  al.,  1994). The  epidemic  ended  only after  draconian  legal  intervention  reduced  the  METH content  of  the  illicit  drug  supply (Konuma,  1994). Another example  occurred  in  Sweden  in  1942,  4  years  following  its introduction,  when  an  estimated  3%  of  the  country’s population used AMPH (Rylander, 1972).

As  of  2000,  the  U.S.  Drug  Enforcement  Agency  states that  METH  is  the  most  prevalent  illicitly  manufactured controlled  substance,  with  6394  reported  clandestine laboratory  seizures  that  year.  The  DEA  estimates  that  4% of  the  American  adult  population  has  used  amphetamines  at least  once.  Local  epidemics  are  current  in  both  rural  pockets of  the  United  States,  including  the  western,  mid-western, and  southern  states  (F.  Butterfield,  New  York  Times, February  11,  2002)  and  large  cities.  One  percent  of Wyoming’s  population  is  now  said  to  require  treatment for  METH  addiction  (T.  Egan,  New  York  Times,  December 

8,  2002).  MDMA  and  METH  are  associated  with  dance parties  and  clubs,  and  METH  use  in  gay  dance  clubs  in  New York  may  have  reached  so-called  epidemic  proportions  (A. Jacobs, New York Times, January 29, 2002).

MDMA,  originally  developed  by  Merck  in  1912  and patented  in  1914  for  use  in  synthesis  of  styptic  drugs  based on  hydrastinine,  was  used  in  the  United  States  by psychotherapists,  particularly  for  couples  therapy,  from 

1978 until 1985 when it was assigned Schedule I status.

There  are  nevertheless  ongoing  efforts  by  some  to reintroduce  MDMA  for  clinical  use,  as  well  as  a  significant and  controversial  body  of  literature  suggesting  neurotoxicity in  serotonin  neurons.  Illicit  MDMA  is  still  widely  self­ administered,  and  9.3  million  tablets  of  MDMA  were confiscated in the United States in 2000. An  early  effort  to  synthesize  AMPH  derivatives  on  the basis  of  knowledge  of  structure-function  relationships resulted  in  trimethoxyamphetamine  (TMA) (Hey,  1947) **(13),** due  to  the  addition  of  an  a-methyl  group  to  mescaline in  order  to  inhibit  its  deamination  (Section 6.1). In  the  words of  David  Nichols,  the  synthesis  of  TMA  “began  the  journey that  ultimately  led  to  the  synthesis  and  pharmacological evaluation  of  nearly  200  potentially  hallucinogenic  sub­ stituted  amphetamines” (Nichols,  1994). Many  other AMPH  derivatives  have  been  explored  for  clinical  uses, including  appetite  suppression  (e.g.,  fenfluramine;  14),  and as  MAO  inhibitors  (Section 6.1) for  treatment  of  Parkinson’s Disease (deprenyl; **15).**

**3.  Evidence for multiple sites of action**

3.1.  History  of  roles  for  plasma  membrane  transporters and secretory vesicles

The  earliest  scientific  efforts  into  understanding  AMPH action  raised  issues  still  debated  today.  This  history  is inextricably  bound  with  the  study  of  the  adrenal  medulla  and its  role  as  a  secretor  of  catecholamines.  The  term catechol  is derived  from  the  plant  product catechu  (a.k.a. gambir),  a cake  of  aqueous  extract  of  leaves  and  twigs  from  the  black catechu  tree, Catechu  nigrum,  native  to  Burma  and  India,  or from Uncaria  gambier,  a  vine  native  to  India  and  Malaysia. Catechu  contains  up  to  30%  catechol,  and  was  traditionally used  to  dye  fabric  brown  (although  tannic  acid,  also  present, contributes  to  this)  and  as  an  astringent  in  the  treatment  of  a variety of medical disorders. The  British  physician  George  Oliver  discovered  the ability  of  adrenal  gland  extract  to  increase  blood  pressure  by injecting  it  into  his  own  son,  noting  a  contraction  of  his  son’s radial  artery  [see  a  fine  review  on  the  history  of  adrenal medulla  research (Carmichael,  1989)]. By 1894,  Oliver  with Edward  Albert  Schafer confirmed  that  this  extract  increased blood  pressure  (in  dogs).  The  compound  responsible  was independently  identified  by  three  laboratories;  Stolz,  Dakin, and  John  Jacob  Abel  in  1897,  a  founder  of  the Journal  of Biological  Chemistry,  who  named  the  compound  epinephr­ ine.  The  preparation  from  oxen  and  sheep  adrenals  was patented  as  Adrenaline  by  the  pharmaceutical  firm  Parke Davis.  Competing  claims  for  priority  provide  one  reason  that this  transmitter  has  38  different  names  in  the  Merck  Index. Ernst  Joseph  Friedman published  epinephrine’s  chemical structure in 1906. These  findings  inspired  the  hypothesis  of  secretory transmission  that  is  the  foundation  of  contemporary 

neuroscience.  Thomas  Renton  Elliott,  a  student  of  John Newport  Langley  at  Cambridge  University,  upon  confirming Oliver  and  Shaefer’s  findings  by  injecting  epinephrine  into dogs,  proposed  that  nerves  communicate  via  release  of  a chemical (Elliot,  1904), writing  that  “adrenaline  might  then be  the  chemical  stimulant  liberated  on  each  occasion  when the  impulse  arrives  at  the  periphery”  [see  a  fine  review  on the early history of neuro transmission (Valenstein, 2002)].

Not  incidentally, Elliott also  proposed  as  early  as  1914 that  nerves  could  accumulate  epinephrine  by  an  uptake 

system,  suggesting  that  the  adrenal  gland  might  “depend  on what  could  be  picked  up  from  the  circulating  blood  and 

stored  in  its  nerve  endings”,  although  demonstration  of uptake  mechanisms  arrived  more  than  40  years  later  (Section 5.1).

Inquiry  into pharmacological  rather  than  endogenous 

stimulant  mechanisms  was  essentially  initiated  by George Barger  and  Henry  H.  Dale  (1910). Barger,  a  chemist 

studying  compounds,  he  isolated  from  putrid  meat,  found that  isoamylamine,  a  weak  base  that  did  not  posses  a catechol  ring,  could,  like  epinephrine,  raise  blood  pressure. He  and  Dale,  working  together  at  the  Wellcome  Physiolo­ gical  Research  Laboratories,  then  examined  other  non­ catechol  weak  bases  for  epinephrine-like  functions.  Dale, the  physiologist  of  the  pair,  initially  assayed  the  compounds by  observing  uterine  contraction.  They  suggested  that  active compounds  be  called sympathomimetic  to  indicate  “the relation  of  the  action  to  innervation  by  the  sympathetic 

system,  without  involving  any  theoretical  preconception  as to  the  meaning  of  that  relation  or  the  precise  mechanism  of the  action.”  Sympathomimetic  potency  was  rated  by  the effect  on  blood  pressure.  Among  the  compounds  they identified  were  |3-phenylethylamine,  and  the  AMPH isomers,  |3-methylphenethylamine  and  phenylpropylamine. In  later  work  by  J.H.  Burn  and  coworkers,  sympathomimetics  that  caused  membrane  contraction  after  sympathetic postganglionic  denervation  (and  were  not  blocked  by reserpine)  were  called directly  acting,  in  contrast  to 

indirectly  acting  amines  that  required  innervation  to  produce contraction  (and  had  reserpine-sensitive  responses;  see below) (Fleckenstein and Bum, 1953).

Another  sympathiomimetic,  cocaine,  derived  from  the Andean Erythoxylon  coca  and  related  species,  provided important  insights  into  the  mechanisms  involved  (cocaine  is now  understood  to  act  primarily  as  an  inhibitor  of  the  plasma membrane  monoamine  uptake  transporters:  see  below  and 

Section 5.1). During  the  1880s  and  until  the  Harrison  Tax Act  in  1914,  which  restricted  coca  products,  there  was  a widespread  vogue  for  cocaine  use  in  the  United  States 

(Angrist  and  Sudilovsky,  1978), where  it  was  associated with  the  introduction  of  Coca-Cola  in  1886  and  initially enthusiastic reports by Sigmund Freud (1884).

In  the  same  year  as  Barger  and  Dale’s  study,  Alfred Frohlich  and  Otto  Loewi  at  the  Pharmacology  Institute  in Vienna  initiated  fundamental  research  into  cocaine  action, reporting  that  cocaine  potentiated  epinephrine’s  increase  in

blood  pressure (Frohlich  and  Loewi,  1910). Surprisingly,  a 

later  study  showed  that  cocaine  did  not  potentiate  but  rather blocked  the  effect  of  the  paradigmatic  sympathomimetic 

drug,  tyramine (Tainter  and  Chang,  1927) even  though  they 

each  independently  increased  blood  pressure;  this  was 

sometimes labeled the cocaine paradox.

Insight  as  to  why  two  sympathomimetics  respond  in 

opposite  manners  to  cocaine  arrived  with  the  introduction  of reserpine  to  the  west,  derived  from  the  Indian  Snakeroot, Rauwolfia  serpentina,  known  in  Bihar  and  Uttar  Pradesh  as Pagal-ki-dawa  (“medicine  for  the  insane”).  Snakeroot,  a 

climbing  shrub  that  grows  from  the  Himalayas  to  Indonesia, 

was  used  in  the  subcontinent  for  treating  mental  illness, 

snakebite,  and  scorpion  stings  for  thousands  of  years.  During the  1940s,  Rustom  Jal  Vakil  of  Bombay’s  KEM  Hospital 

found  it  effective  for  lowering  blood  pressure,  and  it  was prescribed to over 1 million hypertensive patients in India.

Rockland  State  Hospital  for  treatment  of  violent  mentally  ill patients  received  extraordinary  attention  in  the  West. Reserpine  was  considered  a  “miracle  drug”  and  to  some 

extent  replaced  electric  convulsive  therapies  and  lobo­ tomies.  The  U.S.  News  and  World  Report  (November  11, 

1955)  said,  “Mentally  retarded  children  improved  in behavior,  developed  higher  IQs.  Patients  with  the  excruciat­

ing  heart  pains  of  angina  pectoris  had  both  severity  and 

frequency  of  attacks  reduced.  Dogs  were  cured  of 

carsickness;  mares  that  spumed  foals  were  made  normal. 

Skin  diseases  have  been  made  less  severe,  and  intolerable itching  relieved.  Prospects  for  recovery  in  mental  disease have  risen  to  90%  from  65.”  It  can  be  considered  the  first 

antipsychotic  drag.  However,  side  effects  including  night­ mare,  parkinsonism  and  gastrointestinal  disturbances, together  with  the  development  of  other  drags,  have  limited 

subsequent clinical use of reserpine.

Arvid Carlsson  et  al.  (1957) soon  showed  that  reserpine blocked  tyramine’s  increase  of  blood  pressure.  Yet  reserpine 

and  tyramine  did  not  appear  to  act  at  the  same  site.  The 

authors  suggested  that  “tyramine  belongs  to  a  group  of 

sympathomimetic  amines  which  are  fully  active  only  in  the presence  of  an  intact  adrenergic  system.”  In  a  variation  of the  cocaine  paradox,  it  was  not  clear  why  intact  neurons 

would  be  required  for  tyramine’s  action,  and  not  for 

norepinephrine.

This  puzzle  was  essentially  solved  by  J.H.  Burn  and  M.J. 

Rand  at  Oxford (Bum  and  Rand,  1958), who  showed  that 

exogenous  epinephrine  could  still  elevate  blood  pressure 

following  reserpine,  whereas  exogenous  tyramine,  phe-

nethylamine,  ephedrine,  and  AMPH  were  no  longer 

effective  following  reserpine.  They  concluded  “the  sym­ pathomimetic  amines  may  be  divided  into  two  classes,  one 

consisting  of  substances  like  noradrenaline  and  adrenaline, 

which  act  on  vessels  in  both  normal  and  reserpine-treated 

animals,  and  the  other  consists  of  substances  like  tyramine 

which  act  only  on  vessels  of  normal  animals  and  have  little 

or  no  action  on  those  treated  with  reserpine”  and  that 

tyramine  and  AMPH,  which  were  in  the  second  class,  “act  in 

the  normal  animal  by  releasing  a  noradrenaline-like 

substance.”

The  statement  by  Rand  and  Burn  above  is  to  our 

knowledge  the  first  clear  declaration  that  amphetamines  act 

by  releasing  catecholamines.  It  also  provided  a  mechanistic 

explanation  for  the  difference  between  directly-  and 

indirectly-acting  sympathomimetics.  Burn  and  Rand  further 

provided  an  important  clue  toward  solving  the  30-year-old 

mystery  of  the  cocaine  paradox,  why  cocaine  blocks  the 

effects  of  tyramine,  in  that  “the  action  of  cocaine  may  be  to 

arrest  the  release  of  the  noradrenaline-like  substance  from 

the  store.”  In  other  words,  their  study  also  introduced  the 

oft-confirmed  finding  that  uptake  blockers  also  block  reverse 

transport,  although  the  discovery  of  an  uptake  transporter 

system  occurred  only  that  year  in  independent  work  by 

Barbara Hughes and Bernard Brodie (Section 5.1).

Thus,  many  of  the  current  concepts,  controversies,  and 

approaches  used  to  elucidate  AMPH  action  were  introduced 

by  1958.  Note,  however,  that  while  these  studies  used  a 

plasma  membrane  uptake  blocker  (cocaine)  to  determine  if  a 

drag  was  a  releaser  and  a  vesicular  monoamine  transporter 

(VMAT)  inhibitor  (reserpine)  to  determine  involvement  of 

intracellular  stores,  the  identification  of  reserpine  as  a 

blocker  of  vesicular  catecholamine  uptake  per  se  did  not 

occur until 1962 (Carlsson et al., 1962; Kirshner, 1962).

From  the  mid-1960s  through  the  1970s,  a  variety  of 

studies  by  numerous  groups  showed  that  AMPH  also 

released  catecholamines  in  the  CNS,  as  reviewed  by David 

Segal  and  Roland  Kuczenski  (1994), following  the  earlier 

work  in  the  periphery.  A  role  for  AMPH  in  inducing  central 

dopamine  release  was  suggested,  again  by  using  cocaine  or 

other  uptake  blockers  as  AMPH  antagonists (Heikkila  et  al., 

1975b;  Raiteri  et  al.,  1979;  Liang  and  Rutledge,  1982; 

Parker  and  Cubeddu,  1988), as  had  Bum  and  Rand  earlier.  In 

comparing  AMPH  with  cocaine,  Mary  Ritz  and  Michael 

Kuhar  pointed  out  that  while  self-administration  of  cocaine-

like  blockers  correlated  with  their  binding  efficacy  to  DAT, 

AMPH  was  far  more  potent  than  would  be  expected  from  its 

binding.  The  investigators  interpreted  this  finding  to  mean 

that,  as  found  long  before  in  the  periphery,  release  rather 

than  reuptake  blockade  may  be  most  important  for  AMPH 

action  in  the  brain (Ritz  et  al.,  1987). A  role  for  plasma 

membrane  transport  in  AMPH-mediated  release  was 

directly  confirmed  much  later  by  measuring  AMPH-

mediated  dopamine  flux  through  DAT  and  its  inhibition 

by  uptake  blockers (Sulzer  et  al.,  1995), as  well  as  electrical 

currents  associated  with  dopamine  and  AMPH  transport 

(Sonders et al., 1997; Sitte et al., 1998) (Section 5.4).

3.2.  Plasma membrane versus synaptic vesicles?

While  classical  pharmacological  studies  related  above 

implicate  both  plasma  membrane  uptake  transporters  and 

monoamine  secretory/synaptic  vesicles  as  playing  roles  in 

AMPH  action,  and  all  subsequent  studies  concerned  agreed

on  a  role  for  catecholamine  transporters,  the  role  of  synaptic vesicle  pools  has  been  often  doubted,  mostly  due  to  results from  reserpine  experiments.  As  discussed,  this  investigative direction  was  initiated  by  a  study  demonstrating  reserpine blockade  of  tyramine  action (Bum  and  Rand,  1958). Thus, the  first  such  report  indicated  a  role  for  secretory  vesicles  in AMPH  action.  The  conclusions  differed  greatly  in  later literature  due  to  differences  in  experimental  design.  An extremely brief review follows. Most  studies,  both  on  dopamine  and  norepinephrine systems,  were  conducted  with  in  vivo  reserpine  injections generally  given  24  h  prior  to  AMPH  administration.  In nearly  all  examples  of  which  we  are  aware,  reserpine blocked  AMPH  release  of  norepinephrine (Kalisker  et  al., 1975;  Fitzgerald  and  Reid,  1993;  Florin  et  al.,  1995), consistent  with  a  role  for  vesicular  catecholamine.  However, since  norepinephrine  is  predominantly  synthesized  from dopamine  within  vesicles  by  lumenal  dopamine  p-hydroxylase,  the  fraction  of  total  catecholamine  concentration represented  by  norepinephrine  would  be  expected  to  be lower  in  the  cytoplasm  than  in  vesicles.  Thus,  the  effect  of VMAT  inhibition  on  AMPH-mediated  release  could  be greater for norepinephrine than dopamine. Within  the  literature  on  combinatorial  effects  of  reserpine and  AMPH  on  dopamine  release,  some  in  vivo  experiments found  little  or  no  effect  of  reserpine  on  AMPH (Niddam et  al.,  1985;  Callaway  et  al.,  1989;  Arbuthnott  et  al.,  1990), others  reported  reserpine  blockade (Parker  and  Cubeddu, 1986,  1988;  Sabol  et  al.,  1993), and  still  others  found  both responses  depending  on  conditions (Florin  et  al.,  1995). Attempts  to  resolve  the  issue  by  examining  dopamine release  from  synaptosomes  yielded  contradictory  results (Bagchi et al., 1980; Masuoka et al., 1982). One  likely  explanation  for  the  conflicting  findings  is  that reserpine  causes  a  delayed  upregulation  of  tyrosine hydroxylase  activity  via  enhanced  transcription (Pasinetti et  al.,  1990), thus  producing  higher  levels  of  cytosolic dopamine.  In  ventral  midbrain  neuronal  culture,  where  it  is straightforward  to  measure  all  of  the  dopamine  in  the system,  shorter-term  exposure  to  reserpine  (90  min) depleted  exocytic  dopamine  release  but  did  not  increase tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity (Larsen  et  al.,  2002), and  also inhibited  AMPH-mediated  dopamine  release  by  75% (Sulzer  et  al.,  1996). In  conclusion,  the  contribution  of vesicular  catecholamines  to  AMPH-mediated  efflux  appears to  be  greatest  when  vesicle  stores  are  intact,  and  may  thus  be considerable  under  typical  conditions  in  which  the  vast majority  of  catecholamines,  perhaps  >99% (Fon  et  al., 1997;  Mosharov  et  al.,  2003), are  stored  in  the  vesicles. Under  conditions  that  enhance  tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity (Section 6.2), the  role  for  non-vesicular  dopamine  may  be much greater. New  approaches  to  this  long-standing  question  have arisen  over  the  past  decade  as  genetic  manipulations  have allowed  the  issue  of  a  role  for  synaptic  vesicles  in  AMPH action  to  be  addressed  without  reliance  on  reserpine.  Such  an 

approach  to  understanding  AMPH  action  provides  a paradigmatic  example  of  the  application  of  gene  knockout technology  when  the  drug  in  question  has  two  targets  with functions  that  are  closely  intertwined.  Christian  Pill  and collaborators  transformed  COS  cells  to  express  DAT,  the central  vesicular  monoamine  transporter  (VMAT2),  or  both 

(Pill  et  al.,  1995). While  this  cell  line  lacks  synaptic  vesicles, VMAT2  expression  in  other  acidic  organelles,  possibly including  endosomes  and  lysosomes  as  well  as  secretory organelles,  apparently  provides  a  means  to  accumulate dopamine.  AMPH  released  dopamine  only  in  cells  that expressed  DAT.  The  release  was  greater,  however,  for  cells that  also  coexpressed  VMAT,  and  whereas  dopamine  efflux from  DAT  cells  reached  a  peak  and  quickly  returned  to baseline  in  the  continued  presence  of  the  drug,  release  was 

sustained  in  cells  that  coexpressed  DAT  and  VMAT2.  The authors  concluded  that  there  was  both  a  plasmalemmal component  and  vesicular  component  in  the  dopaminereleasing action of AMPH.

Consistent  with  the  results  from  transfected  cell  lines, results  from  studies  using  mouse  mutants  indicate  participa­ tion  of  both  DAT  and  VMAT  in  AMPH  action.  Cyclic voltammetry  studies  by  Sara  Jones  and  coworkers  demon­

strated  that  knockout  mice  that  do  not  express  DAT  did  not exhibit  AMPH-mediated  dopamine  release (Giros  et  al., 

1996;  Jones  et  al.,  1998). Unfortunately,  VMAT2  knockout mice  do  not  feed  and  die  soon  after  birth (Fon  et  al.,  1997; Takahashi  et  al.,  1997;  Wang  et  al.,  1997), and  so  could  not be  assayed  in  the  same  manner.  Neuronal  cultures  derived from  VMAT2  knockout  mice  survive,  however,  and  AMPHmediated  dopamine  release  from  VMAT  knockout  ventral midbrain  neurons  was  depressed  by  65% (Fon  et  al.,  1997). As  was  the  case  for  neuronal  cultures  and  reserpine,  this preparation  allowed  the  system’s  entire  neurotransmitter pool  to  be  measured.  A  rapid  (30  min)  effect  of  AMPH  was to  increase  tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity  in  these  mutant neurons  (Section 6.2), and  along  with  the  drug’s  inhibition  of MAO  (Section 6.1), this  provided  most  of  the  source  for  the remaining  dopamine  release (Larsen  et  al.,  2002). The enhancement  of  tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity  by  AMPH was  far  greater  in  ventral  midbrain  dopamine  cultures  that lacked  VMAT2  expression  or  wild-type  cultures  exposed  to reserpine  than  in  untreated  wild-type  neuronal  cultures. 

Strikingly,  far  more  dopamine  was  released  into  the extracellular  media  by  AMPH  than  was  present  in  the entire  VMAT2  knockout  cultures  at  the  time  that  the  drug was added.

The  basis  for  the  greater  activation  by  AMPH  of  tyrosine hydroxylase  in  neurons  that  do  not  accumulate  vesicular dopamine  remains  mysterious.  The  ability  of  AMPH  to  alter tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity  may  underlie  much  of  the controversy  in  the  literature  of  reserpine  and  AMPH interaction,  prominently  including  findings  using  labeled dopamine  that  suggest  that  AMPH  preferentially  releases  a 

“newly  synthesized  pool”  of  dopamine  [as  reviewed  and explored  by Kuczenski,  1975]. Interestingly,  AMPH

promoted  locomotion  and  survival  in  VMAT2  knockout mice  incapable  of  synaptic  vesicle-mediated  dopamine neurotransmission (Fon  et  al.,  1997)  — while  the  basis  for this  observation  remains  unknown,  it  suggests  the  possibility of physiological roles for non-vesicular dopamine release.

Finally,  perhaps  the  most  satisfying  evidence  that  both 

synaptic  vesicle  and  cytosolic  dopamine  pools  both contribute  to  AMPH  action  was  provided  by  elegant  cyclic voltammetry  studies  in  striatal  brain  slice  by  Sara Jones  et  al. 

(1998). Using  this  approach,  dopamine  released  by  electrical 

stimulation  of  midbrain  terminals  or  AMPH  perfusion  was detected  at  100-ms  resolution.  Jones  stimulated  the terminals  at  regular  intervals  until  the  amount  of  dopamine released  per  pulse  was  stable.  She  then  continued  stimulat­ ing  throughout  the  experiment  and  perfused  AMPH.  AMPH provided  a  rapid,  relatively  small  amount  of  baseline,  i.e., unstimulated,  dopamine  release.  Minutes  later,  the  amount of  dopamine  released  per  electrical  pulse  decreased  while the  baseline  stimulation-independent  release  increased. Thus,  it  appeared  that  the  greatest  amount  of  dopamine released  was  redistributed  from  vesicles  into  the  cytosol.  A later  study  showed  that  a  portion  of  the  decrease  in electrically-evoked  dopamine  release  was  due  to  a  D2 dopamine  receptor  feedback  mechanism (Schmitz  et  al., 2001), but  also  confirmed  that  the  dopamine  that  previously resided  in  synaptic  vesicles  and  was  redistributed  to  the cytosol  was  responsible  for  most  of  the  AMPH-mediated release.

A  variety  of  reports  suggest  the  notion  that  low concentrations  of  AMPH  preferentially  release  catechola­ mine  already  resident  in  the  cytosol,  whereas  higher concentrations  are  required  to  redistribute  vesicular  catecho­ lamine  to  the  cytosol.  If  true,  with  lower  drug  concentrations the  release  is  from  the  cytosolic  pool,  and  with  higher concentrations  mostly  from  the  vesicular  pool (Seiden  et  al., 

1993). The  first  such  claim  we  are  aware  of  is  from  a  study  in which  “bound”  norepinephrine,i.e.,  that  leftoverin  the  tissue after  AMPH  exposure,  was  more  efficiently  released  at  higher AMPH  or  tyramine  levels (Langeloh  and  Trendelenburg, 

1987). The  “bound”  transmitter  was  assumed  to  reflect  the vesicular pool.

It  has,  however,  until  recently  been  impossible  to carefully  distinguish  dopamine  in  one  pool  versus  the  other, as  discussed (Parker  and  Cubeddu,  1988), except  in  the  case of  knockout  mouse  mutants  as  discussed  above.  One prediction  that  could  test  a  role  for  the  vesicle  pool  would  be that  if  AMPH  simply  releases  cytosolic  catecholamine,  then the  free  catecholamine  levels  in  the  cytosol  should  decrease. On  the  other  hand,  if  AMPH  redistributes  catecholamine from  vesicles  to  the  cytosol,  the  free  cytosolic  levels  might increase.

Testing  these  predictions  has  required  a  means  to  measure cytosolic  catecholamines.  An  initial  approach  used  an intracellular  carbon  fiber  electrode  to  measure  free  cytosolic dopamine  in  a  giant  dopamine  neuron  in  the  pond  snail Planorbis  comeus (Sulzer  et  al.,  1995); exposure  to  AMPH 

increased  cytosolic  dopamine,  consistent  with  redistribution 

of  vesicular  dopamine  to  the  cytosol.  Moreover,  when 

AMPH  accumulation  by  plasma  membrane  transporters  was 

skirted  by  an  intracellular  injection  of  ~100  |±M  AMPH, 

there  was  a  rapid  (within  5  s)  increase  in  cytosolic  DA, 

indicating  that  the  effects  on  vesicles  can  be  quite  rapid.  In  a 

more  detailed  approach,  Eugene Mosharov  et  al.  (2003) 

developed  intracellular  patch  electrochemistry,  using  a 

carbon  fiber  electrode  placed  inside  a  patch  electrode  used  in 

whole  cell  mode,  to  measure  cytosolic  catecholamine  levels 

in  chromaffin  cells  and  neurons  (Mosharov  and  Sulzer, 

unpublished).  They  found  that  10  pM  AMPH  induced  a  15-

fold  increase  in  cytosolic  dopamine  within  10-15  min  of 

exposure,  strongly  supporting  redistribution  of  vesicular 

catecholamines.  Cytosolic  catecholamines  returned  to  near 

control  levels  by  40  min,  but  cytosolic  catechol  metabolites 

remained  elevated  as  long  as  AMPH  was  present.  The 

complete  relationship  between  AMPH  concentration  and 

resulting  cytosolic  catecholamine  and  vesicular  levels 

remains  to  be  elucidated,  as  do  the  interacting  roles  of 

catecholamine  synthesis  and  metabolism  (Section 6), but  to 

date  all  results  indicate  that  AMPH  redistributes  vesicular 

catecholamine to the cytosol.

In  summary,  experiments  using  electrochemical  detec­

tion  techniques,  mutated  transporters,  and  reserpine  in 

neuronal  cultures  are  all  consistent  with  the  ability  of  AMPH 

to  act  on  both  vesicular  and  plasma  membrane  transporters, 

and  accordingly,  to  affect  monoamine  pools  both  in  synaptic 

vesicles  and  the  cytosol.  These  findings  also  indicate  a 

generally  unappreciated  role  for  AMPH-induced  de  novo 

dopamine  synthesis  (Section 6.2) in  providing  much  of  that 

dopamine  still  released  after  reserpine  as  well  as  additional 

effects  on  catecholamine  metabolism  that  contribute  to 

AMPH  effects.  It  may  be  that  AMPH,  but  not  reserpine, 

causes  extensive  catecholamine  release  in  parts  because  it 

blocks  MAO  (Section 6.1); strikingly,  while  either  MAO 

inhibition  or  reserpine  alone  does  not  increase  cytosolic 

catecholamine,  the  combination  does (Mosharov  et  al., 

2003). There  are  additional  potential  actions  of  AMPH  on 

extracellular  catecholamine  levels,  such  as  induction  of 

small  excitatory  currents  at  DAT  (Section 6.5), the  ability  to 

directly  bind  receptors  (Section 6.4), and  effects  on  DAT  and 

VMAT  expression  (Section 6.3). The  multiple  interplay  of 

these  actions  easily  provides  us  the  opportunity  for  a  verbose 

review.

**4.  AMPH actions on synaptic vesicles**

4.1.  Early studies on vesicular uptake

Given  the  very  controversial  role  for  synaptic  vesicles  in 

AMPH  action,  it  is  interesting  that  effects  of  these  drugs  on 

isolated  vesicles  have  long  been  noted.  The  first  secretory 

vesicles  studied  were,  not  surprisingly,  the  so-called 

chromaffin  vesicles  of  the  adrenal  gland.  The  term

chromaffin  was  introduced  in  1902  by  Alfred  Kohn  (18671959) (Kohn,  1902) of  the  Prague  German  Medical  Faculty, who  later  survived  imprisonment  in  the  Nazi’s  Theresienstadt  (Terezin)  concentration  camp (Carmichael,  1989). He  used  the  term  to  describe  both  the  reaction  of  chromate salts  to  produce  a  brown  color  and  the  cells  that  reacted.  In 1918,  William  Cramer showed  that  reaction  with  osmic  acid vapor  demonstrated  “adrenalin  granules”  with  the  “appear­ ances  of  fine  coal  dust  scattered  over  the  medulla”  and suggested  that  adrenaline  secretion  to  the  blood  was mediated  by  these  organelles,  effectively  extending  Eliot’s secretory  hypothesis,  but  now  suggesting  structures  that might  be  involved.  The  above  terms  were  combined  by Fritiof  Stif  Sjostrand  to  coin  the  phrase chromaffin  granules (Carmichael,  1989) although  they  are  genuine  secretory vesicles,  and  the  terms  chromaffin  granules  and  chromaffin vesicles are interchangeable. The  first  report  that  AMPH-like  compounds  redistribute catecholamines  from  isolated  vesicles  preceded  the  demon­ stration  of  catecholamine  uptake  by  vesicles.  In 1953, Hermann  Blaschko  with  Arnold  Welch and Nils-Ake  Hillarp and  coworkers independently  published  means  to  isolate chromaffin  vesicles  by  centrifugation.  In  1960-1962,  HJ. Schumann  and  coworkers  showed  that  tyramine,  |3phenethylamine,  AMPH,  METH,  and  ephedrine  each induced  the  release  of  catecholamines,  but  not  ATP,  from suspended  chromaffin  vesicles (Schumann  and  Weigmann, 1960;  Schumann  and  Philippu,  1961,  1962). They  also showed  that  tyramine  and  |3-phenethylamine  were  accumu­ lated  into  chromaffin  vesicles  stoichiometrically  with catecholamine  release.  They  concluded  that  AMPH  (and similar  compounds)  “acts  by  displacement  of  the  catechol amines without releasing equivalent amounts of ATP.” These  results  were  confirmed  by  Carlsson  and  coworkers for  a  variety  of  amines,  including  ephedrine,  mescaline,  and prenylamine  (Segontin:  n-diphenylpropyl-amphetamine) **(16)** (Carlsson  and  Hillarp,  1961;  Carlsson  et  al.,  1963). They  noted  that,  except  for  reserpine,  prenylamine  was  the most  potent  amine  inhibitor  of  vesicular  catecholamine uptake.  Moreover,  prenylamine  was  far  more  efficacious than  reserpine  at  promoting  efflux  from  the  vesicles,  and  at “higher  [10  |J.M],  but  still  very  low  concentrations  it  caused complete  release  of  the  granule  amines,”  making  it  “the most  active  releasing  agent  known  to  date,  apart  from mercuric  chloride.”  Uptake  of  norepinephrine  into  isolated small  synaptic  vesicles  was  later  shown  by  Charles  Rutledge and  coworkers  to  be  inhibited  by  AMPH  and  less  potently  by eight AMPH analogs (Knepper et al., 1988). A  closely  related  concept  to  the  uptake  of  AMPH  in secretory  vesicles  is  that  of  the  “false  transmitter” (Kopin, 1968). In  this  scenario,  a  molecule  other  than  the  native biogenic  amine  transmitter  is  accumulated  within  a  secretory vesicle  and  is  then  available  for  release  during  exocytic fusion.  In  the  process  of  being  loaded  into  secretory  vesicles, the  false  transmitters  promote  non-exocytic  efflux  of  the native  catecholamines  by  displacing  them  from  storage 

vesicles  into  the  cytoplasm  and  ultimately  into  the extracellular  milieu.  Acutely,  the  false  transmitters  indirectly promote  sympathomimetic  activity  whereas  they  diminish  it over  longer  periods  by  reducing  vesicular  stores.  The paradigmatic  false  transmitter  is  tyramine,  and  it  is  thought that  dietary  tyramine  of  microbial  origin  found  in  red  wine, beer,  cheese,  and  sausage  promotes  hypertension  in  patients taking MAO inhibitors by a false transmitter action.

One  prediction  stemming  from  the  hypotheses  above  is that  if  drugs  such  as  AMPH  and  tyramine  redistribute dopamine  from  synaptic  vesicles,  the  drug  should  decrease the  amount  of  transmitter  released  per  secretory  vesicle fusion  event,  i.e.,  the  “quantal  size.”  This  prediction  became testable  with  the  development  of  carbon  fiber  electrodes capable  of  recording  quantal  exocytosis  by  amperometry, initially  (as  usual)  from  adrenal  chromaffin  cells (Wightman et  al.,  1991). Using  this  technology,  AMPH  provided  the  first instance  of  a  manipulation  that  affected  the  quantal  size  of catecholamine  release,  as  amperometric  recordings  in  PC  12 cells,  an  adrenal  chromaffin  cell-derived  cell  line,  demon­

strated  that  10  |±M  of  AMPH  for  10  min  decreased  quantal 

size by 50% (Sulzer et al., 1995).

Decreased  quantal  size  by  AMPH  and  other  weak  bases was  later  confirmed  in  chromaffin  cells (Mundorf  et  al., 

1999) and  the  giant  dopamine  neuron  of Planorbis  comeus. Using  the  latter  system,  Andrew  Ewing  and  coworkers demonstrated  the  existence  of  two  classes  of  dopamine vesicles  that  were  differentially  depleted  by  AMPH 

(Anderson  et  al.,  1998): at  low  concentrations,  AMPH preferentially  depleted  the  large  vesicles,  while  at  higher concentrations,  AMPH  depleted  small  vesicles  more  than large  vesicles.  Interestingly,  biphasic  effects  of  ampheta­ mines  also  occur  in  isolated  chromaffin  vesicles (Slotkin  and Kirshner,  1971), possibly  due  to  lipophilic  diffusion  vs. VMAT-mediated  uptake,  although  the  basis  for  this observation remains enigmatic.

4.2.  Vesicular pH and catecholamine accumulation

AMPH  is  a  lipophilic  weak  base  with  a  pK  of  9.9 (Mack and  Bonisch,  1979) and  is  thus  protonated  in  acidic organelles  including  catecholamine  vesicles (Sulzer  and Rayport,  1990): once  charged,  it  is  less  membrane  perme­ able and accumulates in the acidic structure.

Not  surprisingly  given  the  preceding  discussion,  chro­ maffin  vesicles  were  the  first  subcellular  organelle  shown  to acidify,  as  well  as  to  use  the  resulting  electrochemical gradient  to  provide  the  energy  for  accumulation  of intravesicular  transmitter.  Following  the  elucidation  of  the vacuolar  proton  pump  (known  as  the  V-ATPase),  again  in chromaffin  vesicles (Cidon  and  Nelson,  1983), it  became clear  that  all  components  of  the  secretory  system,  including endosomes,  lysosomes,  and  the  Golgi  apparatus,  use  this 

system to regulate internal acidity.

The  acidic  pH  gradient  in  secretory  vesicles  provides  the energy  to  accumulate  transmitter  against  its  concentration

gradient.  Literature  on  vesicular  uptake  of  catecholamines and  its  relationship  to  vesicular  pH  gradients  is  featured  in  an extensive  review (Johnson,  1988). The  vesicular  monoamine transporters  used  to  harness  this  energy  to  selectively accumulate  catecholamines,  histamine,  and  serotonin  were initially  cloned  by  Robert  Edwards  and  coworkers  from  a chromaffin  cell  tumor  line  (PC12  cells) (Liu  et  al.,  1992), and  later  termed  the  vesicular  monoamine  transporter  1 (VMAT1).  Soon  to  follow  was  the  description  of  a  closely related  gene  expressed  preferentially  in  the  CNS  now  known as VMAT2 (Erickson et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1992). There  is  extensive  evidence  that  AMPH  is  a  substrate  for both  VMATs.  By  measuring  inhibition  of  serotonin  uptake into  CHO  cells  transfected  to  express  either  VMAT1  or VMAT2,  Doris Peter  et  al.  (1994) found  a  nearly  10-fold higher  affinity  for  METH  at  VMAT2,  with  a  preference  for the  S(+)-isomer.  They  also  demonstrated  competition  for binding  between  METH  and  reserpine,  suggesting  they might  bind  to  the  same  site  on  VMAT.  George  Uhl’s laboratory  similarly  reported  that  AMPH  displaced  the VMAT2 blocker tetrabenazine (Gonzalez et al., 1994). It  should  be  noted  that  tetrabenazine  and  reserpine  are thought  to  bind  to  different  sites  on  VMAT (Schuldiner  et  al., 1993a), and  that  the  means  by  which  AMPH  apparently displaces  both  ligands  is  still  not  understood.  Nevertheless, the  antagonism  of  VMAT  ligand  binding  by  AMPH  supports the possibility of its transport. In  fibroblasts  transfected  to  express  either  VMAT1  or VMAT2,  Jeffrey Erickson  et  al.  (1996) found  that  |3phenethylamine,  AMPH,  and  MDMA  exhibited  10-  to  20fold  higher  affinity  for  VMAT2  than  VMAT1,  whereas fenfluramine  had  similar  affinity  for  both  transporters.  For both  VMATs,  S(+)-AMPH  was  about  5-fold  more  potent than  the R(—)-isomer.  It  should  be  noted  that,  as  has  also been  true  with  the  plasma  membrane  transporters,  it  is difficult  to  design  experiments  to  prove  that  AMPH  is  an actual  substrate,  in  part  due  to  its  lipophilicity  and  retention in acidic compartments due to its charge. There  are  at  least  two  non-exclusive  hypotheses  that  may explain  the  mechanism  by  which  AMPH  redistributes vesicular  monoamines  to  the  cytosol,  the weak  base hypothesis and VMAT competition.

4.3.  The weak base hypothesis

All  sympathomimetics  are  weak  bases  with  amine moieties  that  are  capable  of  accepting  protons  with  pk"’s in  the  range  of  ~8  to  10 (Sulzer  and  Rayport,  1990). Secretory  vesicles  are  acidic;  chromaffin  vesicles,  which  are the  best  characterized,  maintain  a  pH  of  5.0-5.6,  depending on  conditions (Johnson,  1988;  Pothos  et  al.,  2002;  Markov et  al.,  submitted  for  publication) that  as  above  (Section 4.2) provide  the  energy  to  accumulate  monoamine  transmitters. The  final  catecholamine  concentration  gradient  at  equili­ brium  is  impressive;  given  sufficient  synthesis  (in  dopamine neurons  and  chromaffin  cells,  following  administration  of 

the  precursor l-DOPA),  vesicles  can  achieve  levels  that,  if they  were  free  in  solution,  would  be  close  to  a  molar (Staal et  al.,  2004). As  cytosolic  catecholamine  levels  in chromaffin  cells  are  ~10  |jlM (Mosharov  et  al.,  2003), acidification  provides  the  energy  to  maintain  an  accumula­ tion of about 100,000-fold.

Whether  used  as  drugs  or  not,  weak  base  compounds  that are  sufficiently  membrane  permeable  to  enter  secretory vesicles  bind  free  protons,  alkalinize  the  existing  acidic  pH gradient  and  thus  decrease  the  energy  that  provides accumulation  of  neurotransmitter.  The  alkalinization  of vesicle  interiors  by  AMPH  was  initially  demonstrated  on isolated  chromaffin  vesicles  and  in  organelles  (likely  a combination  of  several  secretory  organelles)  of  cultured midbrain  dopamine  neurons (Sulzer  and  Rayport,  1990) labeled  with  the  weak  base  vital  dye  acridine  orange  to provide  real  time  observation  of  vesicular  pH  gradients.  The concentration  required  for  AMPH  to  collapse  50%  of  the chromaffin  vesicle  proton  gradient  was  ~50  |±M  for  isolated vesicles.  The  effect  of  AMPH  on  chromaffin  vesicle  pH gradients  was  neither  stereo-specific  nor  blocked  by reserpine,  suggesting  that  much  of  its  entry  into  the  isolated vesicle  preparation  was  due  to  lipophilic  diffusion  rather than via VMAT1.

Similar  results  were  later  reported  for  MDMA,  fenflur­ amine,  and  parachloroamphetamine  (PCA) **(17)** on  isolated chromaffin  granules (Rudnick  and  Wall,  1992;  Schuldiner et  al.,  1993b). Those  authors  suggested  that  the  effect  of PCA  on  vesicles  was  solely  due  to  effects  on  pH,  whereas MDMA  and  fenfluramine  exerted  effects  both  by  altering both pH gradients and vesicular transport.

The  hypothesis  of  vesicular  pH  gradient  collapse  by AMPH  has  recently  been  confirmed  in  cultured  chromaffin cells  with  improved  estimates  of  pH  using  fluorescent ratiometric  methods.  This  approach  showed  that  100  |±M METH  at  30  min  can  almost  completely  collapse  the  pH gradient  in  chromaffin  vesicles;  surprisingly,  longer-term METH  (24  H)  can  lead  to  a  rebound  acidification  with  an accompanying  delayed  increase  in  quantal  size (Markov et  al.,  submitted  for  publication); the  mechanism  underlying this apparent compensation is unknown.

The  weak  base  hypothesis  provides  a  straightforward explanation  for  the  alkalinization  of  vesicular  pH  gradients observed  with  AMPH,  and  at  least  a  partial  explanation  of AMPH’s  decrease  of  quantal  size  (Section 4.1) and  its increase  of  cytosolic  dopamine  (Section 3.2). Even compounds  such  as  ammonium  chloride  and  chloroquine, agents  long  used  to  disrupt  pH  gradients  in  the  laboratory, release  dopamine  from  cultured  dopamine  neurons (Sulzer et  al.,  1993) and  intact  striatum  as  measured  by  micro­ dialysis (Sulzer  et  al.,  1992) via  reverse  transport  following vesicle  alkalinization.  To  date,  all  compounds  that  collapse vesicular  pH  gradients,  including  the  weak  bases  chlor­ oquine  and  ammonium  chloride (Mundorf  et  al.,  1999; Pothos  et  al.,  2002), and  vesicular  chloride  channel  blockers and  the  H+-ATPase  inhibitor  bafilomycin (Pothos  et  al.,

2002), lower  the  number  of  catecholamine  molecules  in vesicles  in  situ,  i.e.,  decrease  quantal  size (Sulzer  and Pothos,  2000), presumably  by  redistribution  to  the  extravesicular milieu following pH gradient collapse. There  are,  however,  phenomena  that  occur  at  vesicles  that are  not  explained  by  this  action.  First,  there  is  no straightforward  relationship  between  effects  on  pH  gradients and  monoamine  accumulation (Reith  and  Coffey,  1994). Second,  the  effect  of  pH  gradient  collapse  on  monoamine release  from  isolated  vesicles  is  comparatively  less  efficient than  that  on  monoamine  uptake (Sulzer  and  Rayport,  1990); this  contrasts  with  findings  of  more  effective  AMPHmediated  release  than  uptake  blockade  at  plasma  membrane transporters  (Section 5). The  lower  efficiency  of  release  with vesicles  could  be  due  to  the  presence  of  intravesicular monoamine  binding  sites,  such  as  chromogranins  and additional  glycosaminoglycan  groups,  both  soluble  and resident  in  the  vesicle  membrane,  that  continue  to  bind catecholamines  in  alkalinized  states  (and  decrease  the genuine free concentration of transmitter in vesicles). Several  studies  have  tested  the  weak  base  hypothesis  by comparing  effects  on  vesicular  pH  and  catecholamine redistribution.  In  isolated  synaptic  vesicles  from  whole  rat brain,  3  pM  AMPH  depleted  at  least  70%  of  previously accumulated  labeled  dopamine,  but  only  collapsed  the proton  gradient  by  12% (Floor  and  Meng,  1996), although the  level  of  alkalinization  from  higher  levels  of  AMPH (~100  p,M)  appeared  to  correlate  with  release.  In chromaffin  granule  ghosts,  AMPH  inhibited  dopamine uptake  more  effectively  than  expected  from  its  collapse  of pH (Reith  et  al.,  1993). Another  indication  that alkalinization  may  not  be  sufficient  to  fully  explain redistribution  of  vesicular  dopamine  is  that  bafilomycin,  a proton  pump  inhibitor  that  is  not  a  VMAT  substrate, decreased  the  pH  gradient  2-fold  more  than  AMPH (Floor and  Meng,  1996), but  released  dopamine  at  only  half  the rate.  [It  should  be  noted,  nevertheless,  that  bafilomycin, like  AMPH  and  control  weak  bases  like  chloroquine,  is quite  effective  at  decreasing  quantal  size  from  vesicles that  are  resident  in  neurons  and  secretory  cells (Pothos et al., 2002).] The  arguments  above  should  also  be  tempered  by considering  that  the  suspension  buffer  greatly  affects  the results  in  these  experiments,  particularly  the  chloride concentration,  which  provides  a  counterion  that  decreases the  vesicular  voltage  gradient  and  allows  a  larger  pH gradient (Johnson,  1988;  Pothos  et  al.,  2002). The  Floor  and Meng  study,  however,  found  a  similar  discrepancy  between proton  gradient  collapse  and  DA  release  at  both  8  and 90 mM chloride (Floor and Meng, 1996). Another  important  consideration  is  the  relationship between  the  proton  gradient  and  vesicular  monoamine accumulation is not linear, but rather

logfy^M =^ + 2ApH (Johnson, 1988) 

where  [A]  is  the  concentration  of  monoamine, MP  is  the 

voltage  gradient,  and  Z  is RTIF  =  50  mV.  If  only  ApH 

changes,  one  monoamine  molecule  would  be  redistributed 

for  two  protons.  Assuming  a  typical MP  =  80  mV,  alkalini­

zation  of  vesicular  pH  gradients  from  pH  5.6  to  5.9,  a 

seemingly  unimpressive  change,  would  in  theory  lead  to  a 

loss  of  75%  of  vesicular  transmitter.  Thus,  an  apparently 

small  change  in  pH  that  may  be  difficult  or  impossible  to measure,  particularly  in  small  vesicles,  may  greatly  affect 

vesicular transmitter.

Another  objection  to  the  weak  base  hypothesis  based  on the  relationship  between  the  pH  gradient  and  redistribution is  that  in  wild-type  CHO  cells,  a  2  order-of-magnitude higher  level  of  METH  was  required  to  abolish  acridine 

orange  staining  than  to  inhibit  serotonin  uptake  in  VMATtransfected  CHO  lines (Peter  et  al.,  1994). A  caveat particular  to  that  experiment,  however,  is  that  CHO  cells 

do  not  contain  synaptic  vesicles,  and  the  effects  of  METH 

were  likely  measured  on  other  acidic  organelles  that 

accumulated serotonin, such as lysosomes.

Perhaps  most  damning  to  the  completeness  of  the  weak base  action  for  explaining  effects  at  vesicles  is  that  the  S(+)AMPH  stereoisomer  is  several  fold  more  effective  than  the R(—)-isomer (Peter  et  al.,  1994). As  the  S(+)-isomer  exhibits preferential  binding  to  the  transporter (Peter  et  al.,  1994; Erickson  et  al.,  1996), these  results  endorse  a  complemen­ tary role for VMAT competition.

As  an  interesting  addendum  to  the  weak  base  effects  of AMPH,  rapid  perfusion  of  the  drug  as  well  as  non­ psychostimulant  weak  bases  induced  quantal  exocytosis 

from  chromaffin  cells  via  a  weak  base  action  (see  Section 

6.6).

4.4.  VMAT competition

A  recurring  theme  is  that  while  amphetamines  compete 

with  reserpine  binding  to  VMAT (Peter  et  al.,  1994) and  with 

ligands  for  plasma  membrane  transporters  (Section 5), it  is not  straightforward  to  prove  that  they  are  actually 

transported  substrates.  If  it  is  transported  by  VMAT,  it  is 

likely  that  AMPH  translocation  from  the  cytoplasm  to  lumen 

will  promote  the  reverse  transport  of  monoamines  from  the 

lumen  since  such  ‘exchange  diffusion’  is  a  general phenomenon  of  carrier  proteins  (Section 5.5). Regardless 

of  whether  AMPH  is  a  VMAT  substrate  or  merely  binds 

without  being  transported,  there  must  be  a  competition between  monoamines  and  AMPH  for  the  uptake  site.  While uptake  blockade  would  not  itself  deplete  vesicular  trans­ mitter,  there  is  an  ongoing  leak  of  vesicular  transmitter, particularly  with  synaptic  vesicles (Floor  et  al.,  1995;  Pothos 

et  al.,  2000;  Schonn  et  al.,  2003). The  combination  of  these 

effects  would  increase  cytosolic  monoamines  providing  that AMPH  in  binding  VMAT  does  not  act  like  cocaine  at  the plasma  membrane  transporter  and  block  reverse  transport  to the  cytosol.  Such  blockade  appears  unlikely  as  there  is  a  leak 

of  vesicular  transmitter  even  with  reserpine,  which  binds

strongly  to  the  cytosolic  face  of  the  transporter:  in  a  manner still  not  explained,  reserpine  apparently  blocks  uptake  but not  release  through  the  VMAT.  It  should  be  noted  that,  while sheer  conjecture,  the  release  of  monoamines  by  AMPH  or reserpine  could  occur  via  a  different  vesicular  transporter  or channel. Differential  binding  of  AMPH  and  its  derivatives  to VMAT  has  been  measured  in  isolated  vesicles (Reith  et  al., 1993) and  digitionin-permeabilized  cells (Erickson  et  al., 1996), but  competition  for  binding  per  se  is  not  a  simple parameter  to  measure  since  a  vesicular/cytosolic  pH  gradient is  also  required  for  uptake  and  can  be  altered  by  the protocols  used.  This  point  was  made  explicit  by  Shimon Schuldiner  et  al.  (1993b), who  showed  that  genuine  ApH dissipation  can  yield  an  artifactual  apparent  competitive inhibition  in  translocation  assays.  This  would  lead  to  an overestimation  of  the  effects  due  to  VMAT  binding  and  an underestimate of effects due to weak base action. Attempts  have  been  made  to  integrate  both  hypotheses. For  example,  a  study  on  isolated  synaptic  vesicles  from whole  brains  and  adrenal  chromaffin  vesicles (Reith  et  al., 1993) suggested  that  AMPH  binding  to  VMAT  is  too  weak to  provide  the  underlying  mechanism  for  vesicular  mono­ amine  uptake  inhibition,  although  the  authors  agree  that  low concentrations  of  AMPH  might  inhibit  uptake  with  little effect on pH. In  summary,  there  are  numerous  unanswered  questions about  the  effects  of  AMPH  on  vesicles.  A  role  for  AMPH uptake  competition  with  catecholamines  can  be  inferred, particularly  at  low  levels  of  AMPH,  but  remains  to  be  clearly differentiated  from  the  drug’s  weak  base  effects  on transvesicular  proton  and  voltage  gradients,  particularly for  synaptic  vesicles.  The  mechanism  of  how  reverse transport  occurs  is  unknown,  and  a  very  old  issue  of  how reserpine  can  inhibit  uptake  but  not  halt  reverse  transport remains  opaque.  The  intravesicular  milieu  including catecholamine  and  AMPH  binding  sites  and  vesicular  ion channels,  particularly  the  anion  conductances  of  Cl-,  may play  important  roles  that  remain  uncharacterized.  The rebound  acidification  of  vesicles  may  have  a  significant effect  on  neurotransmitter  release,  but  this  remains  to  be explored.  As  will  shortly  be  apparent,  many  similar  concerns pertain  to  effects  of  AMPH  at  the  plasma  membrane,  even where study of many of these issues is easier to conduct.

**5.  Actions at plasma membrane transporters**

5.1.  Early studies of cellular monoamine uptake

While  the sine  qua  non  property  of  AMPH  at  monoamine transporters  is  the  promotion  of  monoamine  release  via reverse  transport,  there  are  yet  profound  mysteries  in understanding  how  this  works.  It  is  additionally  clear  that AMPH  is  an  uptake  blocker  as  well  as  a  releaser,  and differentiating  between  elevating  extracellular  monoamines 

by  reverse  transport  or  uptake  blockade  can  be  difficult.  Of course,  the  many  AMPH  derivatives  and  different  transpor­ ters  maintain  different  combinatorial  properties,  an  impor­ tant topic beyond the range of this article.

Although  a  specific  uptake  system  for  epinephrine  was theorized  by  T.R.  Eliott  around  1914  (Section 3.1), the  actual identification  of  a  specific  transmitter  uptake  system occurred  more  than  forty  years  later  by  Bernard  Brodie and  his  fellow,  F.  Barbara  Hughes,  with  many  further insights  provided  by  Julius  Axelrod.  Axelrod  received  a bachelor’s  degree  in  chemistry  in  1933  and  wrote  many  of his  celebrated  papers  as  a  technician  in  Brodie’s  lab  before entering  graduate  school  and  receiving  a  Ph.D.  21  years  later 

(Axelrod,  2003). His  co-discovery  of  neuronal  norepine­ phrine  uptake  along  with  discovery  of  catechol-O-methyl transferase  was  acknowledged  by  the  1970  Nobel  Prize  in medicine.

In  their  initial  reports,  Hughes  and  Brodie  examined 

serotonin  and  catecholamine  uptake  in  guinea  pig  blood platelets (Hughes  et  al.,  1958;  Hughes  and  Brodie,  1959). Their  argument  for  a  specific  uptake  transport  system  was mostly  based  on  inhibition  of  accumulation  by  reserpine; this  was  prior  to  the  identification  of  reserpine  with  vesicle uptake  sites  (Section 3.1), and  they  assumed  that  reserpine inhibited  the  plasma  membrane  uptake  site.  They  concluded that  there  was  “an  endergonic  mechanism  that  rapidly extracts  serotonin  from  the  surrounding  medium  against  a concentration gradient”.

Similar  findings  were  soon  published  for  neuronal catecholamine  uptake  by  two  groups.  Georg Hertting  and Axelrod  (1961) injected  tritiated  norepinephrine  (provided by  Seymour  Kety’s  laboratory,  which  had  recently  devel­ oped  the  technology)  into  cats,  comparing  its  presence  in peripheral  tissues  following  removal  of  superior  cervical ganglia.  During  the  same  year,  Hans Dengler  et  al.  (1961) first  demonstrated  CNS  uptake  of  norepinephrine  by examining  cortical  brain  slices.  As  had  Barbara  Hughes, they  identified  inhibition  by  reserpine  but  suggested  that  the uptake  system  worked  to  deliver  catecholamines  to  “an intracellular  pool  distinct  from  the  particulate  sites,”  or  in contemporary terms, to the cytosol rather than to vesicles.

Leslie  Iversen  introduced  the  terms  “uptake  1”  for cocaine-sensitive  neuronal  uptake  of  norepinephrine  and 

“uptake  2”  for  the  less  avid,  non-neuronal  uptake,  and  these terms  were  widely  adopted  in  the  literature.  Many  years later,  uptake  2  was  shown  to  likely  be  due  to  the  action  of  an organic  cation  transporters  on  astrocytes (Jonker  and Schinkel, 2004).

Axelrod’s  group  re-addressed  the  classical  issue  of  how and  which  psychostimulants  block  reuptake  and  which induce  release.  They  initially  reported  that  cocaine  blocked norepinephrine  uptake  into  the  nerves  innervating  heart, 

spleen,  and  adrenal  gland (Whitby  et  al.,  1960). While  Bum and  Rand  had  shown  in  1958  that  cocaine  blocked  what  later was  confirmed  to  be  reverse  transport  (Section 3.1), to  our knowledge,  Whitby’s  study  is  the  first  to  show  that  cocaine

blocks  catecholamine  uptake,  which  is  now  acknowledged to  be  its  primary  means  of  elevating  extracellular catecholamine levels. In  a  reformulation  of  Bum  and  Rand’s  earlier  categories of directly  and indirectly  acting  sympathomimetics,  Axelrod divided  drags  that  elevated  norepinephrine  levels  in  the blood  into  compounds  that  (a) prevent  norepinephrine uptake,  i.e.,  lower  tissue  norepinephrine  levels  when administered before  the  labeled  norepinephrine,  or  (b) release  norepinephrine,  i.e.,  lower  tissue  norepinephrine when  administered after  labeled  norepinephrine (Axelrod et  al.,  1961). The  tricyclic  antidepressants  imipramine  and chloropromazine  were  labeled  uptake  blockers,  while reserpine,  AMPH,  and  tyramine  were  considered  releasers. While  Axelrod  confirmed  Burn  and  Rand’s  prior  hypothesis that  AMPH  releases  catecholamine,  he  eventually  reported that  AMPH  could  block  both  uptake  and  release  of  labeled norepinephrine  in  the  brain (Axelrod,  1971), underlining  the reoccurring  theme  that  both  aspects  at  the  transporter  may  be important. Most  of  the  neurotransmitter  transporters  were  cloned over  a  very  short  period.  Two  families  of  plasma  membrane neurotransmitter  transporters  were  identified  on  the  basis  of sequence  homology:  one  family  includes  the  norepinephrine (Pacholczyk  et  al.,  1991), dopamine (Kilty  et  al.,  1991; Shimada  et  al.,  1991;  Usdin  et  al.,  1991), gammaaminobutyric  acid  (GABA) (Clark  et  al.,  1992), and serotonin  (5HT) (Blakely  et  al.,  1991;  Hoffman  et  al., 1991) transporters  and  the  other  includes  transporters  for glutamate (Pines  et  al.,  1992;  Storck  et  al.,  1992;  Tanaka, 1993;  Arriza  et  al.,  1994). The  transfection  of  these transporters  into  cells  provided  new  means  to  identify pharmacological effects on uptake and reverse transport.

5.2. How is catecholamine uptake powered?

Plasma  membrane  and  vesicular  neurotransmitter  trans­ porters  are  referred  to  as secondary  active  transporters  or concentrative  transporters  because  they  utilize  electroche­ mical  energy  derived  from  preexisting  ion  gradients, particularly  sodium,  and  the  transmembrane  electrical potential.  The  coupling  coefficients  of  the  transporter  for organic  substrate  and  the  pertinent  ions  determine  the magnitude  of  the  substrate  concentration  gradient  at equilibrium.  The  monoamine  plasma  membrane  transpor­ ters  and  vesicular  transporters  are  thus  analogous  in depending  on  electrochemical  gradients  built  by  other pumps,  but  differ  in  that  the  plasma  membrane  transporters mostly  rely  on  co-transport  of  driving co-substrate  ions  with substrates  whereas  vesicular  carriers  counter-transport monoamines and protons (Sections 4.1 and 4.2). In  principle,  concentrative  transporters  must  possess  at least  one  conformation  that  prevents  substrates  from  simply diffusing  down  their  concentration  gradient.  This  property  is often  labeled  a gating  mechanism.  Literature  on  the  traversal of  a  substrate  or  ion  co-substrate  binding  site  between 

internal  and  external  faces  often  invokes  an alternating access  model (Jardetzky,  1966), meaning  that  binding  sites for  substrates  and  co-substrates  are  alternately  exposed  to extracellular  and  cytoplasmic  environments via  conforma­ tional changes in the transporter protein.

Studies  by  Leslie  Iversen’s  laboratory  and  others  indicated that  catecholamine  uptake  by  membrane  transporters followed  Michaelis-Menten  type  kinetics  and  required  an ion  gradient  that  would  presumably  act  as  a  co-substrate, principally  consisting  of  sodium (Iversen,  1963). The  sodium concentration  gradient  could  then  be  invoked  as  a  means  to provide  energy  for  the  accumulation  of  cytosolic  catechola­ mine against its concentration gradient.

The  precise  stoichiometry  of  ion  exchange  for  catecho­ lamines  has  been  the  subject  of  many  studies.  Perhaps  the most  notable  in  neurons  was  of  DAT  activity  in  striatal 

synaptosomes,  indicating  that  dopamine  accumulation against  a  concentration  gradient  required  the  cotransport of  2  Na+  and  1  Cl-  ions (Krueger,  1990), resulting  in  net import  of  two  cations  per  transport  cycle,  and  these  values are  now  widely  assumed  under  “physiological”  conditions for  DAT.  The  stoichiometry  of  ion  gradients  have  never­ theless  continued  to  be  controversial,  in  part  because  this coupling  may  be  altered  under  different  conditions (Pill  and 

Singer,  1999), and  there  may  well  be  different  values  for  the other  catecholamine  transporters.  Isotopic  studies  on neurotransmitter  transporter-expressing  cells  and  membrane vesicles  indicated  a  stoichiometry  of  one  Na+  and  one  Clfor  each  molecule  of  norepinephrine  for  NET (Galli  et  al., 

1996), while  mammalian  SERT  was  proposed  to  be electroneutral  due  to  additional  counter  ion  flow (Rudnick, 

1998). For  all  of  the  monoamine  transporters,  the  role  of  Clmay  be  particularly  variable,  even  between  paralogs  (species variants  of  a  single  transporter).  The  electrical  gradient  (i.e., membrane  potential)  also  contributes  to  the  driving  force  for 

substrate  uptake  as  recently  pointed  out  for  DAT  (Section 5.5), but  this  factor  is  also  likely  to  vary  between  different transporters.

5.3.  AMPH uptake

It  might  seem  that  AMPH  ought  to  be  subject  to  the  same rales  for  accumulation  as  catecholamines,  but  this  remains uncertain,  and  indeed,  as  is  the  case  for  VMAT  (Section 4.4), it  has  historically  been  difficult  to  determine  if  AMPH  is  a genuine  substrate  of  DAT  and  other  plasma  membrane transporters,  i.e.,  whether  it  is  transported.  This  is  in  part  due to  the  drag’s  lipophilicity  and  accumulation  as  a  weak  base in  lysosomes  and  other  acidic  intracellular  organelles (Mack and  Bonisch,  1979). This  is  an  important  issue,  as  if  AMPH is  not  a  substrate,  it  may  simply  block  uptake  or  even  cause release via a channel-like mechanism (Section 5.5).

An  initial  case  for  specific  uptake  of  AMPH  by transporters  was  made  in  studies  of  stereospecificity, although  it  certainly  is  possible  that  binding  has  stereo­

specificity  even  if  no  transport  occurs.  A  variety  of  studies  in

the  1970s  examined  differential  effects  of  AMPH  stereo­ isomers  on  plasma  membrane  uptake  transport  of  tritiated catecholamines  by  synaptosomes.  In  an  initial  study  by Joseph  Coyle  and  Solomon  Snyder  (1969), the  S(+)-isomer preferentially  blocked  catecholamine  uptake  in  cortical  but not  striatal  synaptosomes.  As  there  is  more  dopamine  in  the striatum  and  more  norepinephrine  in  the  cortex,  it  was suggested  that  the  S(+)-isomer  was  more  effective  than  the R(—)-isomer  at  the  norepinephrine  than  the  dopamine uptake  system.  Most  follow-up  studies,  as  reviewed  by Kenneth Moore  (1978), however,  found  the  opposite response,  with  the  S(+)-isomer  more  potent  at  blocking dopamine  uptake  by  DAT,  and  less  stereoselectivity  for  NET. Presently,  selectivity  for  the  S(+)-isomer  by  DAT  is  widely accepted. While  there  was  evidence  of  cocaine  inhibition  of  AMPH uptake  into  heart  tissue  in  the  1960s (Ross  and  Renyi,  1966), the  classic  demonstration  of  genuine  AMPH  uptake  in neuronal-like  cells  did  not  occur  until  1984 (Bonisch,  1984), mostly  due  to  the  aforementioned  background  uptake  due  to the  drug’s  lipophilic  nature.  For  instance,  although Cho  et  al. (1975) demonstrated  that  the  more  hydrophilic  metabolite  4hydroxyamphetamine  (23)  could  be  accumulated  by  way  of the  dopamine  carrier  in  rat  striatal  synaptosomes,  they  were unable  to  demonstrate  temperature-dependent  uptake  of AMPH  itself.  H.  Bonisch  used  PC12  cells,  a  cancer (phaeochromocytoma)  cell  line  of  rat  chromaffin  cells  with neuronal  characteristics (Greene  and  Tischler,  1976). This study  finally  confirmed  that  cellular  accumulation  of radiolabeled  AMPH  was  indeed  similar  to  that  of  labeled norepinephrine  in  that  it  required  Na+  and  Cl-,  and  was  fully blocked  by  cocaine  and  desipramine.  PC12  cells  were  later shown  to  endogenously  express  the  NET  but  not  the  DAT (Lorang et al., 1994). The  first  convincing  data  we  are  aware  of  that  confirmed AMPH  as  a  transporter  substrate  in  true  neurons  were  from careful  experiments  using  low  concentrations  (5  nM)  of radiolabeled  AMPH  and  striatal  synaptosomes  by  Robert Zaczek  et  al.  (1991a). They  showed  that  AMPH  accumula­ tion  was  saturable,  ouabain-sensitive  (ouabain  blocks  Na+/ K+  exchange,  and  thus  runs  down  the  Na+  gradient  required for  uptake)  and  temperature-dependent,  consistent  with active  transport.  They  estimated  an  apparent  kjTI  of  97  nM and  Vmax  of  3.0  fmol/mg  tissue/min  for  S(+)-AMPH  uptake into  striatal  tissue.  The  DAT  blockers  GBR12909,  methyl­ phenidate,  and  cocaine,  as  well  as  METH,  were  potent inhibitors  of  AMPH  accumulation  while  serotonin  was relatively  weak,  presumably  because  striatal  AMPH  uptake relied  on  DAT,  which  is  much  more  highly  expressed  in  the striatum than SERT. The  same  study  also  confirmed  as  discussed  above  that S(+)-AMPH  was  an  8-fold  more  potent  inhibitor  of  the transport  than  R(—)-AMPH  at  blocking  dopamine  uptake (see  also  preferential  binding  of  the  S(+)-isomer  at  VMAT, Section 4.1, and  at  MAO,  Section 6.1). Interestingly,  the lab’s  accompanying  study  showed  evidence  that  the  AMPH 

once  accumulated  into  the  cytoplasm  may  not  be  free  but rather  bound  to  small  soluble  acidic  peptides  in  the  cytosol 

(Zaczek et al., 1991b).

More  recently,  whole  cell  electrophysiological  record­

ings  of  the  transporter-mediated  currents  have  convincingly 

shown  that  AMPH  is  a  genuine  substrate  for  the  transporters, 

as  related  in  Section 5.4. Given  that,  it  may  be  surprising  that the  ionic  stoichiometry  for  AMPH  uptake  remains 

uncharacterized.  It  may  be  that  binding  and  transport  have 

different  requirements.  It  appears  that  AMPH  binds  even  in the  absence  of  extracellular  Na+,  whereas  high  affinity binding  of  cocaine  analogs  appears  more  strongly  affected by  Na+  removal (Reith  et  al.,  1980;  Sonders  et  al.,  1997;  Li 

et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2003).

5.4.  Differentiating uptake blockade from release

Very  early  work  found  that  cocaine  and  other  uptake blockers  inhibit  tyramine-induced  increase  of  extracellular 

catecholamines (Tainter  and  Chang,  1927) (Section 3.1), and 

much  later,  a  similar  inhibition  by  cocaine  was  reported  for AMPH-mediated  release (Fischer  and  Cho,  1979;  Liang  and 

Rutledge,  1982;  Parker  and  Cubeddu,  1988). Those  findings, however,  only  demonstrated  a  role  for  plasma  membrane transporters.  Cocaine  sitting  at  the  entry  site  of  the transporter  should  in  principle  block both  uptake  and reverse  transport.  While  one  might  imagine  that  uptake blockade  precedes  reverse  transport,  until  quite  recently, 

available  approaches  were  too  slow  to  differentiate  whether 

cocaine  blocked  AMPH  action  due  to  its  inhibition  of AMPH  uptake  as  a  substrate  or  its  blockade  of  dopamine reverse transport (Heikkila et al., 1975a).

Thus,  analogous  to  the  problems  related  above  in  proving that  AMPH  was  a  transported  substrate,  it  was  difficult  to prove  directly  that  catecholamines  could  undergo  reverse transport,  and  it  was  argued  that  transporters  might  be 

designed  so  as  to  not  allow  reversal.  A  real  time 

demonstration  of  this  function  via  DAT  was  finally  provided 

from  studies  using  the  giant  dopamine  neuron  of  the  pond 

snail Planorbis  corneus.  Dopamine  was  injected  directly 

into  the  cytosol  by  a  pipette  and  its  efflux  from  the  neuron measured  by  amperometric  recording,  thus  avoiding  the problem  with  concurrent  uptake  blockade.  The  resulting 

dopamine  efflux  was  completely  and  reversibly  blocked  by the  uptake  inhibitor  nomifensine,  thus  indicating  that  all  of the  detectable  dopamine  was  released  by  reverse  transport 

(Sulzer  et  al.,  1995). Since  the  released  dopamine  was  never taken  up  by  the  transporter,  this  further  suggested  that reverse  transport  occurred  when  an  equilibrium  across  the transporter  was  disrupted.  Similarly,  when  AMPH  was 

directly  injected  into  the  cytosol,  dopamine  was  released  in  a 

nomifensine-inhibitable  manner even  though  AMPH  had  not 

been  accumulated  by  the  transporter.  These  findings 

indicated  not  only  AMPH-induced  reverse  transport  in  the 

absence  of  uptake  blockade,  but  also  that  uptake  and  reverse transport  can  be  dissociated  under  some  circumstances.  (As

well  as  strongly  suggesting  a  role  for  AMPH-mediated redistribution  and  subsequent  release  of  synaptic  vesicle dopamine.)  Later  studies  of  labeled  NE  flux  in  transfected cells  confirmed  that  reverse  transport  and  uptake  blockade both  occur,  dependent  in  part  on  AMPH  concentration (Pill et al., 1999). A  rapid method  that  can char acterize compounds  as upt ake blockers  or  transported  substrates  is  to  measure  the transporter-associated  ion  currents  (Section 5.1) that  accom­ pany  substrate  uptake.  This  approach  was  first  approached  by recording  a  heterologous  system  of  cloned  DAT  in  the  oocyte of  the  African  clawed  frog, Xenopus  laevis (Sonders  et  al., 1997). Known  substrates  of  DAT  induce  Na+-dependent currents  mediated  by  DAT,  whereas  non-substrate  inhibitors of  the  transporter  such  as  cocaine  block  these  currents. Because  AMPH  elicited  such  “transport-associated  cur­ rents,”  this  electrophysiological  approach  thus  clearly identified  AMPH  as  a  DAT  substrate  regardless  of  its  ability to  lipophilically  traverse  the  membrane.  This  approach  further indicated  that  the  AMPH  derivative  methylphenidate  (3),  for instance,  was  not  a  substrate  but  rather  a  DAT  blocker.  Given Ritalin’s  widespread  use  as  a  pharmacotherapy  for  ADHD  in children  and  adults  and  the  neurotoxicity  associated  with  the class  of  releasers,  this  might  be  considered  welcome  news (Section 2.3). The  extent  of  contributions  of  both  reverse  transport  and uptake  blockade  to  AMPH  action  in  striatum  were  finally measured  using  rapid  electrochemical  recordings  in  brain striatal  slice  preparations  and  a  “random  walk/finite difference”  analysis  that  incorporated  Michaelis-Menten kinetics.  (A  tutorial  on  this  approach  is  available  at http:// cumc.columbia.edu/dept/neurology/sulzer/download.html.) The  results  showed  that  AMPH’s  effect  on  dopamine overflow  was  due  primarily  to  reverse  transport  but  that uptake  inhibition  also  contributed  a  substantial  component of the total effect (Schmitz et al., 2001).

5.5. Models of how AMPH activates reverse transport

If  neurotransmitter  transporters  had  no  gating  mechanism they  could  not  maintain  a  high  level  of  cytosolic  substrate. Their  obvious  ability  to  concentrate  substrate  could  arise from  either  of  two  non-exclusive  mechanisms:  (1)  the transporter  could  function  asymmetrically,  operating  more efficiently  for  uptake,  or  (2)  the  prevailing  gradient  of pertinent  ions,  substrate,  and  membrane  potential  might determine substrate flux to favor uptake. Current  research  suggests  that  both  mechanisms  are important.  For  instance,  for  the  GABA  transporter  GAT1, GABA  elicits  “transport  currents”  (a  surrogate  measure  of GABA  flux)  with  clear  asymmetries (Hilgemann  and  Lu, 1999). In  contrast,  some  mutants  of  the  bacterial  lactose permease  transporter  affect  both  uptake  and  reverse  transport equally (Abramson  et  al.,  2003), while  glycine  transporters appear  to  transport  substrate  according  to  the  imposed electrochemical gradient (Roux and Supplisson, 2000).

For  reverse  transport  to  be  effective,  one  or  both  of  these functions  needs  to  be  countervailed,  and  accordingly,  there are  at  least  two  non-exclusive  hypotheses  that  may  explain the  mechanism  by  which  AMPH  enhances  reverse  transport. We label these as:

(1) facilitated  exchange  diffusion:  this  implies  a  net 

asymmetric  substrate  flux  due  to  intrinsic  structural 

properties,  and  in  its  classical  formulation,  an  upper 

limit  of  one-for-one  molecular  exchange  of  AMPH  for 

catecholamine.

(2) channel-like  transport  modes:  this  implies  a  reliance  on 

transmembrane  gradients  for  net  flux  and  an  exchange 

ratio  that  can  exceed  one-for-one  catecholamine 

exchange of AMPH.

As  related  below,  there  are  also  hypotheses  that  integrate both mechanisms.

5.5.1.  Facilitated exchange diffusion

The  most  prominent  model  in  the  literature  used  to explain  how  AMPH  induces  monoamine  release  at  plasma membrane  uptake  transporters  is  the facilitated  exchange diffusion  model.  This  is  based  on  concepts  introduced  by Wilfred  Stein  and  coworkers  at  Hebrew  University  to describe  glucose  transport (Stein,  1967). The  model  relies  on a  binding  site  for  substrate  that  can  crisscross  the  plasma membrane.  To  accumulate  cellular  glucose,  the  binding  site would  take  up  a  molecule  of  glucose  extracellularly  and  then translocate  the  molecule  across  the  membrane  to  release  the glucose  in  the  cytosol.  Reverse  transport  would  occur  when the  binding  site  faces  the  cytosol  after  release  of  the 

substrate,  where  it  could  bind  another  molecule  of  cytosolic glucose  and  later  release  it  extracellularly  following  its  re­ transversal  to  the  external  site.  An  important  aspect  of  this classical  model  is  that  the  traversal  of  the  binding  site  is driven  by  the  substrate;  thus,  there  would  be  a  limit  of  no more  than  one  molecule  of  glucose  released  from  the  cell  for each molecule taken up.

An  important  facet  of  this  model  is  the  question  of  why there  would  be  relatively  little  reverse  transport  of  substrate, 

since  as  above,  there  would  otherwise  be  no  net  cytosolic accumulation.  In  Stein’s  classical  formulation  of  the  model, transport  in  the  reverse  direction  would  be  relatively infrequent  due  to  sodium  binding  to  the  binding  site,  which would  be  much  more  frequent  at  the  extracellular  face  and would  favor  a  confirmation  that  preferentially  elicits  uptake. This  idea  was  specifically  extended  to  catecholamine transporters  by  Donald  Bogdanski  and  Brodie,  who 

suggested  that  sodium  ions,  present  at  higher  levels  on the  extracellular  surface,  would  favor  an  outward  facing orientation (Bogdanski  and  Brodie,  1969). This  hypothesis essentially  partakes  of  both  the  idea  of  transporter asymmetry  and  that  a  transporter  can  be  driven  by transmembrane  gradients.  Thus,  while  there  is  still  an  upper limit  of  one  molecule  of  glucose  released  for  each  molecule

taken  up,  uptake  under  normal  sodium  gradients  would exceed efflux.

In  its  adaptation  to  explaining  AMPH  action (Paton, 

1973), facilitated  exchange  diffusion  states  that  AMPHinduced  dopamine  release  resulted  from  translocation  of AMPH  as  a  substrate  of  DAT,  thus  increasing  the  probability that  the  DAT  binding  sites  face  the  cytosol.  Then  dopamine, which  is  at  higher  concentration  in  the  cytosol,  could  bind the  internalized  binding  site,  thereby  increasing  the  rate  of reverse  transport  of  dopamine.  A  molecule  of  dopamine released  by  reverse  transport  would  follow  the  uptake  of  an AMPH  molecule,  and  in  this  model’s  classical  form,  there would  be  at  most  one  molecule  of  dopamine  released  for each  molecule  of  AMPH  taken  up.  Since  there  is  less intracellular  sodium  to  immobilize  the  inward  face,  most  of the  reverse  traversals  of  the  binding  sites  would  return empty.  Thus,  AMPH  would  work  by  increasing  the  rate  of outward-to-inward  traversals  and  increasing  the  opportunity for  intracellular  dopamine  to  bind  and  be  carried  outwards. Also  by  this  model,  any  external  substrate,  including dopamine  itself,  would  be  predicted  to  stimulate  counterflux of internal substrate molecules.

In 1969,  Hans  Thoenen  et  al. showed  that  tyraminemediated  norepinephrine  release  from  cat  iris  required  the presence  of  external  sodium.  This  supported  the  idea  that AMPH-like  releasers  must  be  accumulated  by  plasma membrane  transporters  to  induce  release.  The  first  sugges­ tion  that  facilitated  exchange  diffusion  per  se  underlies 

sympathomimetic-mediated  catecholamine  release  was  by D.M.  Paton  in  1973 in  a  study  that  showed  that  tyramine  and metaraminol  (3',alpha-dihydroxyamphetamine)  increased efflux  of  norepinephrine  from  rabbit  atria  in  a  manner inhibited  by  cocaine  or  the  norepinephrine  uptake  blocker desipramine.  While  essentially  a  restatement  of  the  old 

“cocaine  paradox”,  and  not  substantially  different  than much  earlier  experiments  by  Bums  and  others  (Section 2), Paton  interpreted  the  results  to  indicate  that  “The  ability  of noradrenaline,  metaraminol  and  tyramine  to  increase  efflux is  in  keeping  with  an  accelerative  exchange  diffusion process”.  The  idea  that  the  cotransport  of  sodium  with  a 

substrate,  which  would  increase  the  affinity  for  substrate  for the  inward  face,  could  favor  reverse  transport  was  suggested by Sammet  and  Graefe  (1979). Thus,  all  of  the  ingredients for  an  AMPH  facilitated  exchange  diffusion  mechanism were in place by 1979.

It  has  not,  however,  been  an  easy  task  to  prove  the existence  of  classical  facilitated  exchange  diffusion  driven by  AMPH.  First,  some  of  the  presumed  requirements  for  this model,  such  as  the  ability  to  saturate  transport,  temperature dependence,  inhibition  by  uptake  blockers,  sensitivity  to 

structural  modification  or  stereospecificity,  could  equally well  apply  to  other  modes  of  release  via  the  transporter  that do  not  require  a  mobile  carrier  to  traverse  the  membrane  (in the  case  of  the  standard  version  of  the  model)  or  to  have  a binding  site(s)  with  alternating  access  to  either  side  (a  more common  version  of  the  model  at  the  present  time);  moreover, 

these  same  properties  could  be  consistent  with  release  by  a 

channel-like mode.

One  prediction  that  might  specifically  endorse  facilitated 

exchange  diffusion  is  that  for  compounds  that  elicit  release  via 

exchange,  those  that  are  better  substrates  for  uptake  should 

also  be  better  releasers,  i.e.,  a  linear  regression  between  the 

two properties.  The first  study we  are aware  of designed  to test 

Paton’s  theory  of  facilitated  exchange  diffusion  as  a  means  of 

AMPH  action  was  by  Charles  Rutledge  and  coworkers 

(Arnold  et  al.,  1977), in  which  they  showed  that  the  S(+)-

AMPH  was  a  more  potent  releaser  of  dopamine  and 

norepinephrine  from  chopped  cortical  brain  tissue  than  its 

stereoisomer.  They  wrote  that  the  temperature  dependence 

and  stereospecificity  of  AMPH-mediated  release  “suggest 

that  a  carrier-mediated,  facilitated  diffusion  is  involved  in 

amphetamine-induced  transport  of  norepinephrine  and 

dopamine.”

A  more  specific  prediction  of  a  linear  relationship 

between  uptake  and  release  was  tested  by J.K.  Fischer  and 

Arthur  Cho  (1979), who  reported  a  nearly  linear  relationship 

between  the  inhibition  of  dopamine  uptake  and  release  for 

both  AMPH  optical  isomers,  and  three  other  sympathomi-

metics.  For  instance,  S(+)-AMPH  was  about  3-fold  more 

efficacious  than  the  R(—)-isomer  at  both  uptake  and  release. 

They  concluded  that  while  AMPH  enhances  cytoplasmic 

dopamine  levels  by  “stimulation  of  granular  release,”  i.e., 

redistribution  of  vesicular  dopamine,  and  by  MAO  inhibi­

tion,  there  was  no  release  of  dopamine  unless  AMPH  was 

taken up the transporter.

In  contrast,  a  follow-up  study  by  U.  Trendelenburg  and 

collaborators  showed  a  non-linear  relationship  between 

uptake  and  release  of  various  AMPH-like  compounds 

(Langeloh  et  al.,  1987). They  compared  the  effects  of  a 

variety  of  sympathomimetics  using  rat  vas  deferens,  tubes  that 

transport  sperm  from  the  epididymis  to  the  ejaculatory  ducts 

and  are  surrounded  by  smooth  muscle  innervated  by 

norepinephrinergic  terminals.  They  did  not  confirm  the 

predicted  straightforward  relationship  between  uptake  and 

release  reported  by  Fischer  and  Cho,  but  rather  that  some 

compounds,  including  AMPH,  were  substantially  better 

releasers  than  substrates  for  uptake.  The  curve  of  release 

versus uptake  was related  to uptake  to the  4th power,  and they 

used  that  relationship  to  surmise  that  there  might  be  four 

different  contributors  to  efflux.  They  suggested  that  these 

were  (in  the  absence  of  vesicular  stores  and  MAO  activity, 

which  were  pharmacologically  blocked  in  that  study):  (1) 

facilitated  exchange  diffusion,  (2)  cotransport  of  sodium  that 

would  increase  the  affinity  of  catecholamines  to  the  inward 

facing  binding  site,  (3)  cotransport  of  chloride,  which  would 

also  increase  affinity,  and  (4)  competitive  inhibition  of 

catecholamine reuptake.

A  study  by Sarah  Jones  et  al.  (1999) to  test  facilitated 

exchange  diffusion  in  the  striatum  found  that  dopamine 

displacement  from  vesicles  by  Ro4-1248  and  reserpine-like 

compounds,  which  would  be  expected  to  increase  cytosolic 

dopamine  levels,  did  not  cause  dopamine  efflux.  This  was

interpreted  to  mean  that  simply  increasing  the  intracellular dopamine  concentration  was  not  enough  to  cause  dopamine efflux  and  that  actual  uptake  of  AMPH  by  DAT  was  essential. Later  results,  however,  contradicted  the  assumption  that reserpine  elevates  cytosolic  dopamine  levels (Mosharov  et  al., 2003), as  cytosolic  catecholamines  were  rapidly  metabolized by  MAO  to  DOPAC  and  similar  derivatives  that  are  not  DAT substrates  (Section 6.1). Note  also  that  a  requirement  of AMPH to  elicit reverse  transport can  be consistent  with a  gated channel-like model. An  electrochemical  study  of  norepinephrine  reverse transport  in  transfected  cells  by Nianhang  Chen  and Joseph  Justice  (1998) used  tyramine  and  cocaine  to  test predictions  of  facilitated  exchange  diffusion.  After allowing  the  cells  to  accumulate  dopamine  and  then challenging  them  with  tyramine,  they  found  that  more tyramine  was  taken  up  than  dopamine  released.  As  they increased  dopamine  accumulation,  tyramine-induced dopamine  release  became  comparatively  more  efficient (but  still  less  than  one-for-one  exchange).  The  authors concluded  that  “theoretically,  with  the  intracellular dopamine  approaching  infinitely  high  concentration,  the efflux  rate  of  internal  dopamine  would  equal  the  uptake rate  of  external  m-tyramine,”  which  would  be  consistent with facilitated exchange diffusion. There  are,  however,  conflicting  results  in  the  tradition  of the  Langeloh  study  indicating  that  uptake  and  release  can  be uncoupled.  In  the  case  of  DAT,  applying  zinc  (10  pM)  to DAT-transfected  cells  stimulates  efflux  of  intracellular [3H]dopamine  despite  its  concomitant  inhibition  of  substrate uptake (Scholze  et  al.,  2002;  Meinild  et  al.,  2004). This dissociation  contravenes  the  expectation  that  efflux  velocity principally  depends  on  the  rate  of  outward-to-inward  facing binding  sites.  Recent  efforts  to  produce  concatemers  of SERT  and  GABA  transporters  suggest  that  the  quaternary arrangement  of  the  proteins  may  regulate  AMPH  driven reverse transport (Seidel et al., 2005). Despite  the  difficulty  in  proving  classical  facilitated exchange  diffusion,  there  is  also  little  reason  to  state  that  it does  not  occur.  There  are,  nevertheless,  instances  of AMPH-driven  reverse  transport  that  facilitated  exchange diffusion  cannot  explain.  For  instance,  AMPH  injected directly  into  giant  dopamine  neurons  of  the Planorbis corneus  pond  snail  induces  reverse  transport  of  dopamine (Sulzer  et  al.,  1995), although  in  that  case,  the  AMPH  was never  transported  by  DAT.  Similarly,  membranophilic  weak bases  that  are  not  DAT  substrates,  such  as  chloroquine  and methylamine,  collapse  synaptic  vesicle  pH  gradients  and induce  reverse  transport  that  is  halted  by  DAT  blockers (Sulzer  et  al.,  1993). Moreover,  simply  increasing intracellular  sodium  can  drive  dopamine  efflux  in  the absence  of  extracellular  AMPH (Khoshbouei  et  al.,  2003), and  release  of  synaptosomal  dopamine  in  Na+-free  medium or  after  inhibition  Na+/K+  exchange  by  ouabain  is  well established (Raiteri  et  al.,  1979). Each  of  these  examples points  out  that  classical  facilitated  exchange  diffusion 

cannot  be  sufficient  to  explain  all  of  the  release  of 

catecholamines by AMPH.

5.5.2. Channel-like transporter modes

Direct  evidence  for  channel-like  release  events  mediated by  AMPH  is  recent,  as  very  rapid  recording  technology  is required  to  observe  such  events.  In  the  initial  reports,  patch 

clamp  recordings  of  cell  lines  expressing  catecholamine transporters  displayed  transient  very  large  events  that 

appeared  to  indicate  ion  channel-like  mode  of  conduction 

of  catecholamine (Galli  et  al.,  1996,  1998). Such  events resemble  uncoupled  ion  conductances  similar  to  those recorded  in  classical  ion  channels.  These  uncoupled  ion 

conductances  have  been  associated  with  DAT (Sonders 

et  al.,  1997), serotonin  transporter  (SERT) (Mager  et  al., 

1994) and  glutamate  transporters (Wadiche  et  al.,  1995;  Otis 

and Jahr, 1998).

The  existence  of  ion-channel  like  conductions  of 

catecholamines  themselves  was  confirmed  by  simulta­

neously  measuring  both  large  current  and  catecholamine release  events  by  combining  patch-clamp  with  ampero­

metric  recordings,  which  demonstrated  that  the  channel-like 

activity  of  the  NET  transporter  was  temporally  associated 

with  transmitter  flux (Galli  et  al.,  1998). The  authors  thus 

concluded  that  the  transmitter  can  cross  the  cell  membrane through an aqueous NET pore.

AMPH-triggered  channel-like  dopamine  release  events 

mediated  by  DAT  were  recently  recorded  from  cultures  of both  midbrain  dopamine  neurons  and  a  DAT-transfected 

cell  line (Kahlig  et  al.,  2005). The  channel-like  events  were 

surprisingly  large,  consisting  of  ~10,000  molecules released  over  at  most  a  few  milliseconds,  startlingly  similar to  quantal  release  events  measured  from  synaptic  vesicle 

exocytosis  from  axons  of  the  same  neurons  (Pothos  et  al., 

1998; Staal  et  al.,  2004); unlike  quantal  events,  however, AMPH-triggered  events  were  completely  blocked  by 

cocaine.

Using  simultaneous  patch-clamp  and  amperometric recordings  as  they  had  for  NET,  the  investigators  confirmed that  AMPH-mediated  reverse  transport  at  DAT  required  the presence  of  intracellular  sodium,  but  found  that  the  number 

of  released  dopamine  molecules  per  ion  transported  was  far higher  during  the  brief  episodes  of  channel-like  release  than the  much  slower,  lower  level  of  release  assumed  to  be  due  to 

exchange  diffusion.  They  estimated  that  about  10%  of AMPH-mediated  dopamine  released  was  due  to  the 

channel-like  events;  although  due  to  the  difficulty  in measuring slow release with amperometry (Schmitz et al.,

2001), the  genuine  contribution  by  channel-like  events  may be  higher.  More  strikingly,  extracellular  AMPH  increased the  frequency  of  channel-like  release  events  by  ~8-fold, 

while  extracellular  dopamine  had  no  effect  on  the  frequency 

of  the  channel-like  events.  These  results  suggest  an unexpected  very  different  response  by  DAT  to  AMPH  or 

dopamine,  the  basis  of  which  is  entirely  unknown,  although the  authors  speculate  that  it  may  have  to  do  with  additional

proteins  associated  with  DAT  that  are  regulated  selectively by the neurotransmitter.

5.5.3.  A  grand  unified  theory?  A  role  for  second messengers? As  above,  Stein’s  introduction  of  a  facilitated  exchange diffusion  model  underlying  reverse  transport  already  had  a role  for  transmembrane  gradients.  Under  most  circum­ stances,  its  adaptation  by  Paton,  Sammet  and  Graefe,  and Fischer  and  Cho  as  an  exchange  mechanism  of  AMPH  for cytosolic  catecholamine  via  increasing  outward-to-inward facing  conformations  is  consistent  with  AMPH  action,  so long  as  a  sufficient  pool  of  cytosolic  substrate  is  available. Nevertheless,  the  ability  of  AMPH,  membranophilic  weak bases,  Na+,  or  Zn2+  to  release  transmitter  even  when  not taken  up  by  DAT,  as  well  as  the  recent  demonstration  of  the existence  of  AMPH-induced  channel-like  release  events mediated  by  DAT  that  release  very  large  quantities  of substrates  via  reverse  flow  through  the  transporter,  indicates that  a  more  detailed  explanation  of  the  structural  changes that  occur  during  reverse  transport  and  its  regulation  by  the various transmembrane gradients is required. An  important  aspect  may  be  due  to  AMPH’s  ability  to stimulate  the  cotransport  of  ions,  as  originally  suggested  by Thonen’s  study (Thoenen  et  al.,  1969), and  the  consequent rearrangement  of  electrochemical  gradients (Sitte  et  al., 1998;  Khoshbouei  et  al.,  2003). The  recent  finding  that AMPH’s  increase  of  intracellular  sodium  concentration  may be  sufficient  to  stimulate  AMPH-induced  DAT-mediated dopamine  efflux (Khoshbouei  et  al.,  2003) supports  the notion  that  this  action  is  essential  for  its  stimulation  of dopamine efflux (Pill and Singer, 1999; Pill et al., 2004). How  might  this  work  at  the  level  of  transporter  structure? A  “unified”  model  that  encompasses  roles  for  both  substrate and  ion  gradients,  as  well  as  channel-like  properties  in  which multiple  substrates  could  be  transported  without  a  shuttling binding  site,  could  be  consistent  with  reports  of  the  structure of  the  first  secondary  active  transporters  to  be  crystallized, the  plasma  membrane E.  coli  bacterial  lactose  permease  and glycerol-3-phosphatase  transporters (Abramson  et  al.,  2003; Huang  et  al.,  2003) as  well  as  a  putative  prokaryotic glutamate  transporter  from  the  thermophilic  archaean Pyrococcus  horikoshii (Yemool  et  al.,  2004); unfortunately, only  a  single  conformation  is  currently  available  for  each transporter,  and  so  these  hypotheses  are  quite  conjectural. These  first  two  structures  were  suggested  to  be  consistent with  a rocker-switch  alternating  access  model,  in  which tilting  of  transporter  domains  would close  a  “cavity”  on  the cytoplasmic  side  (the inward-facing  conformation)  to thereby open  a  new  “cavity”  on  the  extracellular  (or  for bacteria,  periplasmic)  side  (the outward-facing  conforma­ tion) (Huang  et  al.,  2003;  Locher  et  al.,  2003). The  structure of  the  putative  glutamate  transporter (Yemool  et  al.,  2004) suggested  an  alternate  model  in  which  coordinated  “flipper” movements  of  two  sets  of  two  hairpin  loops  might  allow alternating  access  by  occluding  the  transporter,  perhaps  in  a 

series  of  three  conformations.  As  pointed  out  in  a  short review (Kavanaugh,  2004), this  differs  from  the  rocker­

switch  model  in  that  it  provides  an  “open  state”  on  either 

side of the membrane without an “open channel”.

Both  models  would  provide  variations  on  the  classical facilitated  exchange  diffusion,  but  without  the  requirement for  a  binding  site  that  traverses  the  membrane,  and  so  they can  seemingly  provide  for  channel-like  events.  There  would then  be  no  limit  of  a  one-for-one  molecule  exchange  of cytosolic  substrate  in  reverse  transport.  Rather,  reverse transport  may  follow  electrochemical/ionic/substrate  gra­ dients  that  act  to  lower  the  energy  barrier  for  favorable conformations  that  favor  translocation.  If  in  the  case  of AMPH  reverse  transport,  this  would  be  provided  by  AMPH acting  as  a  substrate  itself  or  its  accompanying  cotransported ion(s).  This  would  be  neither  classical  facilitated  exchange diffusion  with  a  one-to-one  molecule  limit  nor  a  channel  that 

simply  follows  a  substrate  gradient  once  it  has  been  opened, but  rather  a  gating  mechanism  that  exhibits  aspects  of  both classical hypotheses.

New  work (Khoshbouei  et  al.,  2004) seems  consistent with  such  a unified  model,  invoking  an  asymmetric transporter  that  suggests  a  conformational  property  of DAT  that  typically  favors  influx  over  efflux,  but  with  net  flux controlled  by  transmembrane  substrate  gradients,  and  also introduces  a  potential  second  messenger  system  that  may provide  the  basis  for  these  observations.  Evidence  for  an asymmetric  conformation  of  the  transporter  is  that  when  the first  22  amino  acids  of  the  N-terminal  region  of  DAT  were truncated  or  if  serine  residues  in  that  region  were  mutated  to alanine  (which  cannot  be  phosphorylated),  AMPH-mediated dopamine  efflux  was  selectively  reduced  by  ~80%.  As mutating  the  same  serine  residues  to  aspartate  in  order  to 

simulate  serine  phosphorylation  resulted  in  normal  AMPHmediated  efflux,  the  authors  suggested  that  phosphorylation of  some  serines  may  shift  DAT  from  a  “reluctant”  state  to  a 

“willing”  state  that  favors  AMPH-induced  dopamine  efflux, without affecting normal dopamine uptake.

Consistent  with  a  regulation  of  transport  direction  by 

second  messenger  systems,  numerous  putative  phosphor­ ylation  sites  for  various  protein  kinases  were  identified  in  the intracellular  domains  of  the  DAT (Giros  et  al.,  1996;  Granas et  al.,  2003). In  addition,  multiple  protein  kinases  have  been 

shown  to  regulate  DAT  function (Melikian  and  Buckley, 

1999;  Carvelli  et  al.,  2002;  Granas  et  al.,  2003;  Loder  and Melikian,  2003). Interestingly,  AMPH  has  been  shown  to increase  striatal  particulate  protein  kinase  C  (PKC)  activity 

(Giambalvo,  1992). Accordingly,  PKC  activation  has  been 

shown  to  stimulate  DAT-mediated  release  of  dopamine 

(Giambalvo,  1992;  Kantor  and  Gnegy,  1998), and  AMPHmediated  DA  release  is  inhibited  by  PKC  inhibitors  and  by downregulation  of  PKC (Kantor  and  Gnegy,  1998), whereas 

[ 3 H]DA  uptake  is  unaffected  by  these  manipulations. Moreover,  phosphorylation  of  NET  by  protein  kinase  C  is reported  to  be  required  for  AMPH-mediated  efflux (Kantor et al., 2001).

It  may  be  that  the  combination  of  AMPH  and phosphorylation  produces  a  DAT  conformation  that  favors dopamine  efflux.  This  would  also  be  a  new  non-classical variant  of  facilitated  exchange  diffusion  (if  one  could  still call  it  that),  as  there  would  no  longer  be  a  requirement  of  a one-for-one  exchange  of  dopamine  and  AMPH  molecules.  It may  be  that  some  such  DAT  states  underlie  the  channel-like release events.

In  summary,  despite  very  strong  confirmation  of  the notion  that  AMPH  elicits  reverse  transport,  there  are  many unanswered  questions  on  how  it  does  so.  How  do  changes  in ion  and  substrate  concentrations  and  gradients  affect facilitated  exchange  diffusion  or  channel-like  properties? How  important  is  the  putative  channel-like  mode  for  the efflux  of  neurotransmitter,  and  why  is  it  selectively  activated by  AMPH  but  not  dopamine?  How  do  second  messenger 

systems  and  associated  proteins  alter  these  states?  What  are the  relevant  structural  conformations,  and  are  the  neuro­ transmitter  and  ion  substrate  binding  and  translocation  sites identical  on  the  cytosolic  and  extracellular  sides?  While  the classical  transport  models  have  contributed  important  ideas, is  it  time  to  develop  new  names  for  the  revised  models  that avoid  confusing  semantic  traps?  Or,  as  in  Friedrich Nietchze’s  version  of  the  wisdom  of  Zarathustra,  shall  we researchers “muddy their water that it may seem deep” ?

**6.  Other  mechanisms  that  affect  extracellular** **catecholamine levels**

There  are  many  other  properties  of  AMPH  that  contribute to  drug  effects,  but  we  have  attempted  to  limit  this  review  to those  that  affect  extracellular  catecholamines.  Here  we review  additional  mechanisms  that  may  be  important  in regulating  extracellular  catecholamines,  in  particular  for AMPH  and  METH.  For  some  mechanisms,  such  as  MAO inhibition,  the  effects  are  clearly  germane,  while  for  others  a genuine role is yet to be elucidated.

6.1. Amphetamines as monoamine oxidase inhibitors

A  means  by  which  amphetamines  can  influence  neuro­ transmitter  release  apart  from  effects  on  plasma  membrane and  vesicular  transporters  is  to  increase  the  quantity  of biogenic  amine  available  for  release  by  inhibiting  MAOs  — key  mediators  of  amine  catabolism  located  on  the  outer mitochondrial  membrane.  AMPH  derivatives  are  competitive inhibitors  of  these  enzymes,  and  recognition  of  this  fact  far predates  the  isolation  of  the  enzymes.  Hermann Blaschko et  al.  (1937) used  a  range  of  substrates  and  inhibitors  to characterize  amine  oxidizing  activities  in  various  tissue, animal,  and  plant  preparations.  They  demonstrated  that  many isopropylamines,  including  AMPH  and  ephedrine,  are  not themselves  subject  to  degradation  by  the  enzyme  preparations but  can  nevertheless  block  the  consumption  of  oxygen otherwise  used  to  oxidize  substrates  including  epinephrine 

and  tyramine.  It  is  worth  noting  Merton  Sandler’s  opinion  that 

these  studies  of  amine  oxidation  by  Blaschko  “were  probably 

responsible  for  triggering  off  the  psychopharmacology 

revolution” (Sandler,  2004) as  they  presaged  the  introduction 

of  MAO  inhibitors  for  treatment  of  depression:  such  use  of  the 

drugs  was  initiated  in  the  early  1950s  after  mood  elevation 

was  noted  following  administration  of  iproniazid  to 

tuberculosis patients.

Mann  and  Quastel  (1940) reported  an  analogous  finding 

on  MAO  inhibition  motivated  by  an  entirely  different 

rationale.  AMPH  has  long  been  used  for  treating  narcolepsy 

(Section 2.3). The  authors  were  interested  in  testing  a 

hypothesis  that  narcolepsy  resulted  from  amine-induced 

inhibition  of  brain  metabolism  by  determining  whether 

AMPH  prevented  a  gradual  decline  in  respiration  observed 

in  tissue  treated  with  amine  oxidase  substrates  such  as 

tyramine.  Their  findings  suggested  that  aldehydes  formed  by 

amine  oxidation  depressed  respiration  and  that  AMPH 

inhibited their formation, albeit with modest potency.

In 1971,  Leitz  and  Stefano published  a  study  of 

norepinephrine  metabolism  and  release  in  which  they  drew 

the  bold  conclusion  that  the  principal  actions  of  AMPH, 

tyramine,  and  metaraminol  on  neurotransmitter  release  is 

mediated  through  MAO  inhibition.  Using  perfused  rat  hearts 

preloaded  with  [3H]norepinephrine,  they  observed  that 

AMPH  and  tyramine  increased  [3H]norepinephrine  and 

concomitantly  decreased  its  tritiated  deaminated  metabo­

lites  in  the  perfusate.  To  bolster  their  argument,  the  authors 

also  showed  that  tranylcypromine **(18),** an  irreversible  MAO 

inhibitor  which  is  an  AMPH  analog,  had  effects  comparable 

to  those  of  AMPH  on  releasing  tritiated  species.  These 

results,  however,  were  likely  the  conflated  outcome  of  at 

least  three  distinct  mechanisms:  (1)  effects  on  MAO  activity; 

(2)  efflux  through  plasma  membrane  NET;  and  (3)  the  efflux 

of  the  acidic  and  glycol  metabolites.  Furthermore,  tranyl­

cypromine  is  a  substrate  of  the  plasma  membrane 

transporters  and  therefore  could  promote  efflux,  while  the 

timescale  tested  may  have  been  too  short  to  observe 

irreversible  effects  of  tranylcypromine  on  MAO. Rutledge 

(1970) made  a  concerted  attempt  to  disentangle  such  factors 

using  rabbit  brain  slices  and  synaptosomal  preparations  and 

reached  a  different  conclusion:  that  AMPH  prevents 

deamination  most  potently  by  acting  at  plasma  membrane 

transporters  to  block  reuptake  and  facilitate  efflux  of  amines 

from  the  cytoplasm  which  thus  escape  MAO,  although 

AMPH additionally acts to directly inhibit MAO.

The  development  of  relatively  specific  irreversible 

inhibitors  for  MAO  A  (clorgyline)  and  B  (deprenyl) **(13)** 

subtypes  in  the  1960s (Knoll  et  al.,  1965;  Johnston,  1968; 

Knoll  and  Magyar,  1972) facilitated  the  study  of  inhibitor 

selectivity.  AMPH  and  many  of  its  analogs  show  5-fold  or 

greater  selectivity  for  MAO  A  over  MAO  B (Mantle  et  al., 

1976;  Robinson,  1985;  Scorzaetal.,  1997), and  most  behave 

as  reversible  and  competitive  non-substrate  inhibitors.  The 

affinity  of  AMPH  for  MAO  A  is  typically  in  the  range  of 

10  |±M  for  the  S(+)-enantiomer,  a  few  fold  higher  in  affinity

than  its  optical  antipode (Mantle  et  al.,  1976;  Robinson, 1985). Thus,  the  stereoselectivity  of  MAO  A  for  S(+)-AMPH is  similar  to  those  of  DAT  and  VMAT.  METH,  which  shows comparable  affinity  and  stereoselectivity  to  AMPH  at  the plasma  membrane  transporters,  in  contrast,  displays  about five-fold  lower  affinity  (~100  p-M)  than  (±)-AMPH  for MAO  A  and  essentially  no  stereoselectivity (Robinson, 1985). The  affinities  of  AMPH  and  METH  for  MAOs compare  unfavorably  with  their  potency  at  NET  and  DAT, which  are  usually  reported  in  the  100-200  nM  range (references in Sections 5.1 and 5.2). Considering  the  poor  affinity  and  stereoselectivity  of MAO  B  for  AMPH  and  METH,  it  is  curious  that  the prototypic  substrate  for  MAO  B  is  p-phenethylamine,  which differs  from  AMPH  only  in  lacking  the  a-methyl  group,  and that  the  first  and  still  widely-used  irreversible  selective  MAO B  inhibitor  is  (—)-deprenyl,  an  A-2-propynyl  analog  of METH.  [Note  that  deprenyl  is  metabolized  to  AMPH  and METH (Reynolds  et  al.,  1978).] AMPH-like  structures  have served  as  a  useful  scaffold  for  the  development  of  much more  potent  competitive  and  irreversible  inhibitors  includ­ ing  amiflamine (Ask  et  al.,  1989) **(19),** 4-methoxy-AMPH (PMA) **(20),** 4-methylthio-AMPH (Scorza  et  al.,  1997) **(21),** pheniprazine **(22),** and tranylcypromine **(18).** In  summary,  while  there  is  a  relatively  low  potency  of AMPH  at  MAO,  one  cannot  discount  a  contribution  from MAO  inhibition  to  its  spectrum  of  physiological  activity. Notably,  while  neither  reserpine  nor  MAO  inhibitors  alone increase  cytosolic  dopamine,  intracellular  patch  electro­ chemistry  shows  that  the  combination  of  the  two  causes  a profound  increase  similar  to  that  of  AMPH  itself (Mosharov et al.,  2003). As AMPH  is a  substrate of  the plasma  membrane transporters,  it  could  be  concentrated  in  the  cytoplasm  to  a level  that  inhibits  MAOs  on  the  outer  mitochondrial membranes.  Numerous  factors  already  mentioned  make  it difficult  to  determine  the  cytoplasmic  AMPH  concentrations attained  after  physiological  doses  of  the  drug,  including  the ability  of  AMPH  to  lipophilically  diffuse  across  membranes and  its  uptake  into  vesicles  by  VMAT  and  due  to  its accumulation as a weak base in acidic compartments. Finally,  although  little  data  is  available,  a  major  metabolite of  AMPH (Cho  and  Kumagai,  1994) 4-OH-AMPH  (amethyl-p-tyramine)  (23)  is  likely  to  serve  as  a  competitive inhibitor  of  MAO  A.  As  a  substrate  of  the  plasma  membrane transporters (Cho  et  al.,  1975,  1977) with  lower  membrane permeability  than  AMPH,  the  4-OH-AMPH  metabolite  might be  more  likely  than  AMPH  to  reach  high  levels  in  the cytoplasm to serve as an effective MAO inhibitor.

6.2. Promotion of dopamine synthesis

AMPH  has  long  been  noted  to  enhance  dopamine synthesis,  and  this  provides  an  important  role  in  its  action under  some  conditions,  e.g.,  following  reserpine  treatment (Section 3.2). This  effect  can  be  so  profound,  as  measured  in dopamine  neuronal  culture,  that  AMPH  releases  far  more 

dopamine  in  the  culture  medium  than  was  initially  present  in the entire culture prior to AMPH exposure (Larsen et al., 2002).

There  were  initial  indications  that  AMPH  enhanced dopamine  synthesis  in  in  vivo  experiments (Costa  et  al., 

1972), but  a  confirmation  that  this  was  due  to  tyrosine hydroxylase  activity  awaited  measurement  of  the  conversion of  radiolabeled  tyrosine  to  dopamine  in  rat  striatal 

synaptosomes (Kuczenski,  1975), where  AMPH  at  con­ centrations  up  to  15  |±M  enhanced  dopamine  synthesis  by  as much  as  70%,  while  higher  levels  sharply  decreased conversion,  reaching  control  levels  of  activity  at 

~500  | jiM.  This  enhancement  of  tyrosine  hydroxylase requires extracellular calcium (Fung and Uretsky, 1982).

The  mechanism  by  which  AMPH  enhances  tyrosine hydroxylase  activity  is  unknown.  While  calcium-dependent 

second  messenger  phosphorylation  of  serine  residues  on tyrosine  hydroxylase  can  regulate  enzymatic  activity 

(Griffiths  and  Marley,  2001), the  relationship  to  AMPH remains  obscure.  An  alternate  possibility  is  that  AMPH  may 

substitute  for  dopamine  at  its  tyrosine  hydroxylase-binding 

site  from  where  it  exerts  feedback  inhibition (Goldstein  and Greene,  1987;  Haycock,  1993). Similarly  the  mechanism  of AMPH’s  tyrosine  hydroxylase  inhibition  at  higher  levels remains  unknown,  although  it  has  long  been  suggested  to  be due  to  feedback  inhibition  from  increased  levels  of  cytosolic dopamine (Harris et al., 1975) (Section 6.1).

6.3.  Effects on DAT and VMAT trafficking

This  hypothesis  that  AMPH  acutely  regulates  DAT  cell 

surface  expression  originated  from  a  study  by  Annette Fleckenstein  and  coworkers  in  which  a  single,  high  dose  of AMPH  administered  to  rats  decreased  DAT  function  1  h later (Fleckenstein  et  al.,  1997). Further  work  confirmed  that dopamine  regulates  transporter  cell  surface  expression.  For example,  in Xenopus  laevis  oocytes  expressing  DAT, application  of  dopamine  reduced  DAT  cell  surface  expres­

sion  as  measured  by  binding  by  the  DAT  ligand  [3H]WIN 

35,428 (Gulley  et  al.,  2002) and  similar  dopamine  regulation of  DAT  membrane  expression  was  observed  in  rat  striatal 

synaptosomes (Chi and Reith, 2003).

Like  dopamine,  AMPH  acutely  reduced  cell  surface expression  of  human  DAT  (hDAT)  in  cell  lines,  leading  to  a concomitant  loss  of  DAT  activity (Saunders  et  al.,  2000). Kahlig  et  al.  (2004) using  confocal  imaging  and  electro­ physiology,  demonstrated  that  AMPH  application  causes hDAT  to  redistribute  from  the  plasma  membrane  as  an  active carrier. Sorkina  et  al.  (2003) extended  these  observations  by 

showing  that  AMPH-induced  intracellular  accumulation  of hDAT on endosomal vesicles.

In  addition  to  mediating  hDAT  cell  surface  redistribution, AMPH  and  its  derivatives  appear  to  regulate  VMAT2 function.  In  particular,  a  single  METH  injection  rapidly  (1  h) and  reversibly  decreased  dopamine  uptake  in  a  vesicleenriched  fraction  obtained  from  rat  striatum (Brown  et  al.,

2000, 2002) [for review, see Fleckenstein and Hanson, 2003]. The  METH  action  was  likely  largely  associated  with the  dopaminergic  system,  as  the  destruction  of  the 

serotonergic  projections  did  not  alter  the  effects  on  vesicular dopamine  uptake.  It  is  possible  that  the  response  to  AMPH  is indirect  and  that  the  apparent  inhibition  of  VMAT2  is  due  to D2  autoreceptor  activation  following  dopamine  release 

(Brown  et  al.,  2002). If  VMAT2  is  indeed  redistributed  to endosomes  or  other  compartments,  it  will  be  important  to determine the signaling and mechanics involved.

6.4.  Trace amine receptors and other potential 

receptors for AMPH

As  discussed,  there  has  long  been  speculation  that endogenous  AMPH-like  biogenic  amines,  prominently including  p-phenethylamine,  act  as  endogenous  ampheta­ mines  (Section 2.2). There  has  been  a  resurgence  in  interest in  this  topic  due  to  the  discovery  of  a  family  of  15 mammalian  G  protein-coupled  trace  amine  receptors 

(Borowsky  et  al.,  2001;  Bunzow  et  al.,  2001). The  rat  trace amine  receptor,  rTARl,  which  has  been  the  most  thoroughly characterized  of  these  receptors (Bunzow  et  al.,  2001), acts to  stimulate  cAMP  production;  additional  downstream 

second  messenger  responses  are  likely  to  be  involved. Little  is  now  known  about  the  physiological  actions  of  these receptors,  and  there  is  as  yet  no  data  indicating  that  they  are involved  in  AMPH’s  role  in  enhancing  extracellular catecholamines.

rTARl  is  activated  by  a  broad  array  of  amines,  including 

P-phenethylamine  and  tyramine.  AMPH  and  METH  are both  potent  activators,  with  nearly  identical  responses  to both  isomers.  MDMA  and  hydroxylated  AMPH  derivatives are  likewise  effective,  while  fenfluramine  has  no  action. Interestingly,  the  meta-O-methyl  derivatives  of  the  cate­ cholamines,  namely  3-methoxytyramine,  normetanephrine, and  metanephrine,  are  more  efficacious  activators  of  rTARl than  their  respective  precursors  dopamine,  NE,  and epinephrine.

There  are  other  receptors  that  may  be  activated  by AMPH.  AMPH  binds  to  a-2  adrenergic  receptors (Ritz  and Kuhar,  1989), and  while  these  are  presynaptic  receptors,  we are  unaware  of  a  demonstration  that  they  are  located  on dopamine  terminals.  It  is  nevertheless  possible  that  this action  underlies  effects  of  AMPH  on  anxiety  and  other effects  of  central  norepinephrine  neurons,  where  the presynaptic  receptor  is  found,  and  it  is  interesting  that  the anxiogenic  and  psychotomimetic  drug  yohimbine  (from  the West African tree Corynanthe yohimbe), is an a-2 blocker.

It  should  be  noted  that  some  AMPH  analogs,  prominently including  “hallucinogenic”  derivatives  directly  activate 

serotonin  receptors  and  moreover  that  some  are  more 

specific  for  SERT  than  DAT  (e.g.,  fenfluramine).  Many derivatives  have  been  developed  by  medicinal  chemists through  extensive  studies  on  structure-function  relation­

ships  and  are  beyond  the  scope  of  this  review,  but  are 

discussed  in  excellent  reviews  by  others (Nichols,  1994; 

Schmidt, 1994).

One  study  claims  that  AMPH  releases  catecholamines  by 

activating  nicotinic  acetylcholine  receptors (Liu  et  al., 

2003), primarily  based  on  measuring  Ca2+  transients  in 

chromaffin  cells  (see  also  Section 6.6). In  apparent  contrast, 

single  channel  electrophysiological  studies  indicate  that 

AMPH (Spitzmaul  et  al.,  1999) and  ephedrine (Bouzat, 

1996) act  as  nicotinic  receptor  channel  blockers.  It  will  be 

interesting  to  see  how  this  issue  develops  and  whether  there 

is any pharmacological significance.

6.5.  Depolarization at the DAT

As  detailed  above  (Section 6.4), catecholamine  trans­

porters  transport  Na+  and  Cl-  ions.  Susan Ingram  et  al. 

(2002) reported  that  DAT  activation  by  AMPH  can  induce 

sufficient  excitatory  current  to  potentiate  neuronal  firing. 

Surprisingly,  this  excitation  follows  the  inward  flux  of  Cl-, 

which  normally  hyperpolarizes  these  neurons.  If  borne  out, 

the  finding  could  explain  reports  of  AMPH-induced 

neuronal  excitation (Shi  et  al.,  2000) and  exocytic 

catecholamine  release (Pierce  and  Kalivas,  1997;  Darracq 

et  al.,  2001). It  may  be  that  relatively  low  exposures  to 

AMPH  stimulate  dopamine  neuronal  firing  or  enhance  the 

releasable  vesicular  pool,  although  we  are  not  aware  of 

direct  evidence  at  this  time  beyond  Ingram’s  study  to  support 

these  possibilities.  Rather,  experiments  with  striatal  slices 

demonstrate  that  AMPH-induced  dopamine  release  inhibits 

dopamine  release  by  activating  presynaptic  terminal  D2 

autoreceptors (Schmitz  et  al.,  2001), and  there  is  a 

significant literature on D2 autoreceptor inhibition of firing.

6.6.  Intracellular  calcium  triggered  via  weak  base 

effects

Mark  Wightman  and  coworkers  reported  that  rapid 

perfusion  of  AMPH  as  well  as  non-psychostimulant  weak 

bases  induced  quantal  exocytosis  from  chromaffin  cells  via  a 

weak  base  action (Mundorf  et  al.,  1999), as  the  accumulation 

of  intravesicular  calcium  by  chromaffin  vesicles  can  may  be 

indirectly  dependent  on  H+  gradients (Haigh  and  Phillips, 

1993). The  level  of  calcium  redistributed  from  the  vesicles 

by  AMPH  may  be  sufficient  to  induce  vesicular  exocytosis, 

and  this  could  underlie  a  portion  of  AMPH  action  in 

secretory  cells  under  some  conditions.  AMPH  has  not  yet 

been  observed  to  induce  exocytosis  via  effects  on  cytosolic 

calcium  levels  from  vesicles  in  central  neurons,  and  from  the 

data  discussed  in  Sections 2-5, there  remains  little  evidence 

suggesting  a  substantial  direct  effect  on  exocytosis  in  central 

acute  AMPH-mediated  catecholamine  release,  although  this 

has  by  no  means  been  ruled  out.  It  should,  however,  be 

pointed  out  that  a  prominent  indirect  effect  of  AMPH  is  to 

activate  presynaptic  D2  or  adrenergic  receptors  that  inhibit 

subsequent  evoked  vesicular  catecholamine  release 

(Schmitz et al., 2001).

1.**Epilogue**

Despite  the  importance  of  self-administered  drugs  of reward  and  addiction,  a  thorough  understanding  of  the mechanisms  of  action  of  some,  including  ethanol  and AMPH,  continues  to  elude  us.  Perhaps  our  deepest impression  from  perusing  over  a  century  of  literature  on AMPH  is  that  while  new  technologies  allow  some  long­ standing  hypotheses  to  be  revised,  refined,  or  discarded, variations  on  the  earliest  questions  on  mechanisms  of  action continue  to  re-arise.  We  hope  that  the  historical  approach  we have  adopted  here  underlines  the  profound  insights  gleaned from  relatively  restricted  experimental  tools  by  the  talented pioneers of this research.
