## **ABSTRACT**

# **Introduction:** Attention-deficit/hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a Serious Neurobehavioral Disorder of Childhood Onset That Often Persists

# Into Adolescence and Adulthood. Functional

# Impairments, Underachievement, and Difficult

# Interpersonal Relationships Illustrate the Need for Effective Treatment of ADHD Through Adulthood.

# **Method:This** Prospective, Multisite, ran­ Domized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled,

# Parallel-group, Dose-escalation Study Was Conducted to Assess the Efficacy, Safety, and Duration of Action of Mixed Amphetamine Salts Extended-release (MAS XR) in Adults with ADHD, Combined Type. Adults >18 Years of Age Were Given Placebo or MAS XR 20, 40, or 60 mg/day for 4 weeks.The Main out­ Come Measures Were the ADHD Rating Scale and Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale Short Version Self-Report (CAARS-S-S).

Original Research

# Statistically and Clinically Significant ADHD symp­ Tom Reduction at Endpoint; Mean ADHD Rating Scale Scores Were 18.5 for the 20-mg Group (P=.OO1), 18.4 for the 40-mg Group (P<.001), and 18.5 for the 60-mg Group (Pc.001). Adults with Severe Symptoms (ADHD Rating Scale Score >32 at baseline) Had Significantly Greater Symptom Reduction with the Highest MAS XR Dose (60 mg/day), However, This Dose-response relation­ Ship Was Determined by Post-hoc analysis.The Mean MAS XR Effect Size Was 0.8. Statistically Significant (Pc.05) Improvements in CAARS-S-S ADHD Index Scores Occurred at 4and 12-hours Postdose for All MAS XR Groups, Indicating a 12-hour Duration of Effect. Symptoms Improved Within the First Treatment Week. Most Adverse Events Reported Were Mild or Moderate in inten­ Sity, and the Most Commonly Reported Adverse Events Were Consistent with the Known Profile of Stimulant Medications. Vital Signs and elec­ Trocardiograms Showed No Clinically Significant Cardiovascular Changes. **Conclusion:**These Results Suggest That MAS XR is Safe and Effective in Adults with ADHD and Controlled ADHD Symptoms for up to 12 Hours.

# **INTRODUCTION_______________________** Attention-deficit/hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a Serious Neurobehavioral Disorder of Childhood Onset That Often Persists into ado­ Lescence and Adulthood. Estimates of the preva­ Lence and Persistence of ADHD Vary Depending on the Diagnostic Criteria Used and Definitions of Persistence.1 Based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) Criteria,2 -10% of Schoolaged Youth Worldwide Are Affected by ADHD3

# 5 And 4.4% of Adults in the United States Have ADHD.6 With 209 Million Adults >18 Years of Age and a 4.4% Prevalence Rate, >9 Million Adults in the US May Have ADHD.7

# Faraone and Colleagues8 Surveyed Primary Care and Psychiatry Practices to Determine

# Whether Patterns of Diagnosis and Treatment of

# Adult ADHD Differ. Only 25% of the Patients with ADHD Were First Diagnosed in Childhood or ado­

# Lescence. Although ADHD is a Chronic Disorder,

# Many Individuals Are Able to Compensate Until the Challenges of Family and Career Become Overwhelming. In the Faraone and Colleagues8 Study, >90% of Adults with Undiagnosed ADHD Were Self-referred, Both in Primary Care and

# Psychiatric Settings, and Common Symptoms That Motivated Self-referral Were General disor­

# Ganization, Problems with Time Management, a Tendency to Leave Projects Incomplete, and dif­ Ficulty Functioning at Work. Greater Than 50% of

# Previously Undiagnosed Adults Had Complained About ADHD Symptoms to Other Healthcare

# Professionals in the Past. Unlike the Standard of Care in Pediatrics, Adults Are Not Routinely Screened for ADHD in Primary Care. Lack of Training and Uncertainty About the Diagnosis

# Likely Contribute to the Underrecognition of the Disorder in Adults.

# Clinical, Family, Psychopharmacologic, Neu-

# Robiologic, Neuropsychological, and Outcome Studies Support the Validity of Adult ADHD.9

# Neuroimaging Studies1011 Indicate a Profile of Prefrontal Dopaminergic Hypoactivity in Both Adult and Childhood ADHD. The Core Symptoms of ADHD—inattentiveness, Impulsivity, and Hyperactivity—are Well Documented in Adult ADHD, Although Hyperactivity Symptoms Tend to Diminish with Age.1213 Similar Functional impair­ Ments, Such as Educational or Occupational Underachievement and Difficult Interpersonal Relationships, Affect Both Children and Adults with ADHD.1416 Compared with Ageand gen­ Der-matched Individuals, Teenagers and Young Adults with ADHD Are >4 Times as Likely to Have Automobile Accidents.17 Significantly Fewer Adults with ADHD Had Attended College, Twice as Many Had Been Divorced, and Half as Many Were Completely Satisfied with Their Professional Lives and Career Tracks.16 These Life Impairments illus­ Trate the Need for Effective Treatment of ADHD Throughout the Lifespan.

# Stimulant Medications Have Been Studied Extensively in Children with ADHD and Have a Well-established Safety and Efficacy pro­ File. Research Suggests That Adults with ADHD Respond Well to Stimulants When Adequate Doses Are Used.1819 A Number of Once-daily Extendedrelease (XR) Stimulant Formulations Have Been Developed Recently and Are Likely to Increase

# Treatment Compliance,20 Particularly in a pop­

# Ulation That Tends to Be Forgetful and disorga­

# Nized. Additionally, XR Formulations May Reduce the Abuse Potential Compared with Immediate-

# Release (IR) Formulations.2122

# Mixed Amphetamine Salts XR (MAS XR) Capsules Contain a 1:1 Ratio of Immediate-to-

# Delayed-release MAS pellets.The pharmacoki­

# Netic Profile of One MAS XR 20-mg Capsule is Equivalent to That of Two MAS IR 10-mg Tablets Dosed 4-6 Hours apart.23The Safety Profile and

# Rapid Onset of Action of MAS XR Are Similar to Those of the IR Tablets, but the Long-acting for­

# Mulation Provides a Persistent 12-hour thera­

# Peutic Effect with Once-daily Dosing.2425 A Linear

# Pharmacokinetic Profile for MAS XR 20 Mg, 40

# Mg, and 60 mg/day Has Been Demonstrated

# In Healthy adults.26This Randomized, double­ Blind, Placebo-controlled, Forced-dose-escalation Study Was Designed to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of MAS XR 20, 40, and 60 mg/day in

# Adults with ADHD. We Hypothesized That MAS XR Would Reduce ADHD Symptoms Significantly

# In Adults and That Higher Doses Would Lead to Greater Symptom Improvement.

## **METHODS**

# **Subjects And Eligibility Criteria**

# Subjects Were Outpatients >18 Years of Age Who Were Referred by Clinics and Had a Primary Diagnosis of ADHD Established by Psychiatric Evaluation Using DSM-IV-TR Criteria.2 Diagnosis

# Required Identification of at Least Six of Nine Symptoms for hyperactive/impulsive and inat­ Tentive Subtype Criteria and ADHD Onset by 7 Years of Age. Subjects Were in Good physi­ Cal Health, with Normal Vital Signs and 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements.This Study Complied with Institutional Review Board

# Regulations and the Declaration of Helsinki, 2000 Revision. Each Subject Provided Written,

# Informed Consent After Study Procedures and Objectives Were Disclosed.

# Subjects Incapable of Following Study instruc­ Tions or Having an Intelligence Quotient <80 (Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test) Were Excluded From the Study. Several Comorbid Psychiatric Diagnoses Were Excluded: Psychosis, Bipolar ill­

# Ness, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, Severe Obsessive-compulsive Disorder, and Severe Depressive (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score >19) and Anxiety Disorders

# (14-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety

# Score >17). Subjects Were Excluded for a posi­

# Tive Drug Screen or Substance Abuse History (or

# Living with Someone with a Substance Abuse

# disorder); Glaucoma; Hyperthyroidism; Seizure,

# Tic Disorder, orTourette Syndrome; and preg­

# Nancy or Lactation. Also Excluded Were Subjects

# Who Were Taking Within 30 Days of the screen­

# Ing Visit Any Anticonvulsant Drugs, Clonidine,

# Guanfacine, Systemic Steroids, Medications That

# Affect Blood Pressure (BP) or the Heart or Have

# Central Nervous System Effects, Pemoline, or

# Investigational Drugs.

# **Study Design**

# This Was a Multisite, Randomized, double­

# Blind, Placebo-controlled, Parallel-group Study

# Designed to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of

# Three Doses of MAS XR in Adults with ADHD.

# The Study Was Conducted Between February 6,

# 2002, And May 24, 2002. Eligible Subjects Were

# Randomly Assigned (3 Active:1 placebo) to a Daily

# Morning Dose of MAS XR 20 Mg, 40 Mg, or 60

# Mg for 4 Weeks (Figure 1).This Was a Forced-

# Dose-escalation Design and Dosage Modification

# Was Not Permitted; Subjects Were Excluded if

# Sustained Drug Intolerance Occurred.

Original Research

# **Measurements**

# **Primary Efficacy Assessments**

# Investigators Completed the ADHD Rating

# Scale to Assess the 18 Individual Symptom cri­

# Teria of ADHD in DSM-IV-TR at Baseline and

# At Each Clinic Visit. The ADHD Rating Scale is

# Composed of Two Subscales, Inattentive and

# hyperactive/impulsive; All Items Were Scored

# On a 4-point Scale From 0 (no symptoms) to 3

# (severe symptoms).

# **Secondary Efficacy Assessments**

# Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale-Short

# Version-Self-Report (CAARS-S-S) Was Used to

# Determine the Duration of MAS XR Action. Each

# Item Was Scored on a 4-point Scale, From 0 (not

# At All, never) to 3 (very Much, Very frequently). The Five CAARS-S-S Subscales Include the 12-

# Item ADHD Index and 4-factor-derived, 5-item Scales. The CAARS-S-S ADHD Index Measures the Overall Level of ADHD-related Symptoms

# Using Items That Capture Daily Symptomatology, Such as "I Have a Short fuse/hot temper," "I Am

# Always on the go,” "I Feel Restless Even When Sitting still," and "Things I Hear or See Distract

# Me From What I'm doing." Using an Interactive Voice-response System, Subjects Completed the

# CAARS-S-S at 4and 12-hours Postdose 3 days/ Week During the Washout Week and Each of the 4 Treatment Weeks.

# The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S), -Improvement (CGI-I), and -Efficacy

# (CGI-E) Scales Were Used to Determine Overall

# Improvement Over Time. The CGI-S is a Crosssectional Assessment of the Severity of Illness Using a 7-point Scale and Was Assessed at base­

# Line and End point.The CGI-I (also a 7-point scale) Provides a Longitudinal Assessment of Overall Symptom Improvement Relative to base­

# Line and Was Measured Weekly During the 4 Treatment Weeks. Investigators Also Completed the CGI-E Weekly. The CGI-E Consists of Two

# Items (Therapeutic Effects and Side Effects), Each of Which is a 4-point Scale Intended spe­ Cifically to Capture Medication Effects.

# **Safety Assessments**

# Safety Was Assessed Through Physical exami­ Nation, Neurologic Evaluation, Vital Sign mea­ Surements, and Clinical Laboratory Test Results. A

# 12-lead ECG, Performed at Baseline and 2-week Intervals, Was Evaluated for Safety by the inves­ Tigator but Was Analyzed for ECG Measures by a Central Laboratory. Spontaneously Reported

# Adverse Events (AEs) Were Recorded Weekly Using

# Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse

# Reaction Terms (COSTART)27 Terminology.

# **Statistical Analysis**

# **Determination Of Sample Size**

# An Enrollment of 200 Subjects Was Required

# To Detect a Standardized Treatment Difference of

# 0.60 Between Any MAS XR Group and the pla­

# Cebo Group at 80% Power (type I error=.05) Using

# A 2-sided T-test.

# **Randomization**

# Eligible Subjects Were Randomly Assigned to

# One of the Four Double-blind Treatment Groups

# (MAS XR 20, 40, or 60 mg/day or placebo) in a

# 1:1:1:1 Ratio Using a Block Randomization sched­

# Ule. Each Site Initially Received Treatment Kits in

# Two Complete Blocks (eg, Eight Pre-numbered

# Drug kits); Additional Kits Were Provided in com­

# Plete Blocks as needed.The Clinical Study coordi­

# Nator at Each Site Assigned Eligible Subjects the

# Next Available Randomization Number in ascend­

# Ing Order. Statistical Tests Were Completed to

# Determine Whether the Counts (Cochran-Mantel-

# Haenszel [CMH] test) and Means (F test) for

# Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Were

# Similar Across Treatment Groups.

# Analyses Were Performed Using SAS statisti­

# Cal Software, Version 6.12 or Higher.28 Efficacy

# Results Were Analyzed on the Intent-to-treat

# (ITT) Sample (all Subjects Assigned to Treatment

# With at Least One Valid Post-baseline ADHD

# Rating Scale Total score). Safety Results Were

# Analyzed for All Subjects Assigned to Treatment.

# For All Measures, the Endpoint Was Defined as

# The Last Valid Postbaseline Observation (numer­

# Ically Equivalent to a Last Observation-carried

# Forward analysis).

# **Primary Efficacy Analysis**

# For the ADHD Rating Scale Total Score at end­

# Point, an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) Was

# Performed, with Treatment and Site as Fixed

# Effects and the Baseline Score as a Covariate.

# Dunnett's Test Was Used to Compare Each Active

# Treatment Group with Placebo if an Overall

# Treatment Effect Was detected.This Model Was

# Also Applied to ADHD Rating Scale Total Scores

# At Each Treatment Week and the ADHD Rating

# Scale Subscale Scores at Endpoint. Effect Size

# For the ADHD Rating Scale Total Score at end­

# Point Was Calculated as the Mean Treatment dif­

# Ference for MAS XR Versus Placebo Divided by

# The Pooled Standard Deviation.

Original Research

# **Secondary Efficacy Analyses** Endpoint CAARS-S-S ADHD Index Scores Were Analyzed Using an ANCOVA Model, with Treatment and Site as Fixed Effects and the aver­ Age Baseline ADHD Index Score as a Covariate. For Significant Overall Treatment Effects, Pairwise Comparisons Were Performed Using a Closed-testing Procedure: a T-test Between the Least-squares Means of the MAS XR 60-mg and Placebo Groups Was Performed First; if a Significant Difference Was Detected, the Same Test Was Performed for the 40-mg and 20-mg Groups. To Determine the Treatment Effect at 4and 12-hours Postdose, a Similar Analysis Was Performed for Both Postdose ADHD Index Scores at Endpoint. A Dichotomized Variable Was Created for the CGI-I: the "improved" Category Included Subjects "very Much improved" and "much improved"; the "not improved" Category Included All Other Ratings. For Placebo and Active Treatment Pairs, the Dichotomized CGI-I at Endpoint Was Analyzed for Differences Using a CMH Test Adjusted for site.The CGI-S and CGIE Results Were Summarized as Categorical vari­ Ables (n, % for Each rating). **Post-Hoc Efficacy Analyses** To Further Investigate the Dose-response Relationship Between ADHD Rating Scale Scores and Actual Final Dose (adjusted for Final Dose Duration and Baseline severity), a 1-way ANCOVA Was Performed. Actual Dose Was the Effect, and Baseline ADHD Rating Scale Total Score Was a covariate.The Difference in ADHD Rating Scale Change From Baseline Among the Active Doses Was Assessed for Each treat­ Ment Week. Actual Dose Refers to the Final Dose Achieved, Which in Some Cases Was Less Than the Dose Assigned by Randomization. Because This Was a Forced-dose-escalation Design, sub­ Jects Assigned to Higher Doses Did Not Achieve Their Final Assigned Dose Until Midway Through the Study. Some Subjects May Have Withdrawn From the Study Before Reaching the Assigned Dose. The Model Included the Placebo Dose to Address the Issue of Minimum Effective Dose. Analyses Were Performed on ITT Subjects seg­ Regated by the Median Baseline ADHD Rating Scale Score: <32 (mild) and >32 (severe). The Median Baseline Score Was Chosen to Provide Similar Sample Sizes for This Analysis. The Linear Association Between Final MAS XR Dose at Each Treatment Week and the propor­

# Tion of Subjects Rated "very Much improved" or

# "much improved" On the CGI-I Scale Was ana­

# Lyzed Using the Mantel-Haenszel X2 Test.

# **Safety Analyses**

# Treatment-emergent AEs Were Summarized

# By Body System, Preferred Term, and Treatment Group. Because the Same Subject May Have

# Reported the Same AE When Receiving Different

# Doses of MAS XR in This forced-dose-escala­ Tion Design, the Counts (and percentages) of AEs by Treatment Group Are Not Independent observations.This Lack of Independence Could Affect the Variability and Would Invalidate a Test That Assumes Independence of the pro­

# Portions. Because There is No Methodology for a Statistical Test for Linear Trends in propor­ Tions Where the Proportions Are Dependent, No Statistical Test for a Dose Relationship for AEs Was Conducted. An ANCOVA Model with treat­ Ment as a Fixed Effect and Baseline as a Covariate Was Fitted to the Laboratory, Vital Sign, and ECG Interval Data for Each Visit. For statisti­ Cally Significant Treatment Effects, Dunnett's Test Assessed Which Active-treatment Groups Differed Significantly From the Placebo Group.

# ECGs Included Interval Measurements (RR

# Interval, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB [Bazett correction],

# Heart rate) and Tracing Interpretations (rhythm, Conduction, Morphology, Myocardial infarc­ Tion, ST segments,T Waves, U waves).

# **Post-Hoc Safety Analyses**

# Outlier Analyses of Safety Measures, includ­

# Ing AE Reports, Vital Signs, and ECGs (including QTcF [Fridericia correction]) Were Completed to Further Investigate the Dose-response relation­ Ship for Safety Measures. Individual BP measure­

# Ments >140 mmHg for Systolic or >90 mmHg for Diastolic on Two Consecutive Visits Were consid­ Ered Clinically Significant.28 A Predefined Limit of >110 Beats per Minute Was Considered Clinically Significant for Individual Pulse Measurements.

# Individual Changes in QT or QTcF Intervals >60

# Milliseconds Relative to Baseline Values Were Considered Clinically Noteworthy.30

## **RESULTS**

# **Study Sample**

# Eighteen Study Sites Screened 339 Adults, and 259 Subjects Entered the Washout Phase of the Study; 255 Were Randomly Assigned to Treatment, and 248 Were Included in the ITT Sample (Figure 2).

# **Clinical Global Impressions** Only 27% of Placebo Subjects Experienced Robust Improvement (endpoint CGI-I Score of 1 or 2 ["very Much improved" or "much improved"]) Compared with 55% of Subjects Receiving MAS XR (103/188). The Nonzero Correlation CMH Statistic Showed a Statistically Significant Correlation (Pc.OOl) Between Dose and the Percentage of Subjects Considered Improved by Investigators (includes Ratings of "very Much improved" or "much improved" on the CGI-I scale) (Table 3).The Post-hoc Analysis of CGI-I indi­ Cated That, at Week 2, When Subjects Assigned to the 40and 60-mg Groups Received 40 mg/ Day, the Linear Relationship Between Dose and Proportion of sub­ Jects Considered Improved Was Statistically signifi­ Cant (P=.O3). At Weeks 3 and 4, When Subjects Were Receiving Assigned Doses (20, 40, or 60 mg/day) According to the Forced-dose-escalation Design, the Association Between MAS XR Dose and the propor­ Tion of Subjects Who Were Improved Was Statistically Significant (P=.01 and P=.04, Weeks 3 and 4, respec­ Tively [Figure 4]).These Findings Demonstrate a Clear Dose-response for Efficacy as Measured by the CGI-I.

# **Safety**

# All 259 Subjects Enrolled Were Included in the AE evaluation.The ITT Sample (n=255) Was evalu­

# Ated for All Other Safety Measures.

# **Adverse Events**

# No Serious Adverse Events (AEs) Were Reported. The Incidences of Treatment-related AEs Are sum­

# Marized inTable 4.The Most Commonly Reported AEs Were Dry Mouth (27.4% of All Subjects

# enrolled), anorexia/decreased Appetite (25.5%),

# Insomnia (23.9%), and Headache (23.6%). Most AEs Were Mild or Moderate in Intensity. Insomnia Was the Only Severe AE Reported in Two or More MAS XR-treated Subjects (20-mg Group: n=2; 40-mg Group: n=3; 60-mg Group: n=4). Most AEs Occurred During the First Treatment Week.

# Twenty-four Subjects Withdrew From the Study Due to AEs: One (1.6%) Placebo-treated Subject,

# Nine (13.6%) MAS XR 20-mg Subjects, 6 (9.4%) 40-mg Subjects, and Eight (13.1%) 60-mg sub­ Jects (Figure 2). The Most Common AEs lead­ Ing to Discontinuation Were Insomnia (10 [3.9%] subjects), Agitation (four [1.6%] subjects), anxi­ Ety (four 1.6%), and Nervousness (four 1.6%).

# Three Subjects Were Withdrawn From the Study Due to Cardiovascular AEs (two Tachycardia; One hypertension), One Participant Had Increased

# Liver Enzymes, and One Experienced Chest Pain of Unclear Etiology. None of the Subjects Required Treatment for an AE.

# **Other Safety Assessments**

# There Was a Slight Decrease From Baseline to Endpoint in Mean Cholesterol (-2.4 mg/dL) for Placebo, Compared with Larger, Statistically Significant (Pc.05), Decreases for MAS XR 20 mg/ Day (-15.5 mg/dL), 40 mg/day (-16.0 mg/dL), and 60 mg/day (-18.6 mg/dL).There Was Also a Slight Decrease in Triglycerides for Placebo (-1.8 mg/dL) Compared with Larger, Statistically Significant

# (Pc.05), Decreases for MAS XR 20 mg/day (-31.0

# mg/dL), 40 mg/day (-20.0 mg/dL) And 60 mg/day

# (-42.4 mg/dL). Changes in Mean Laboratory val­

# Ues From Baseline to Endpoint Were Otherwise Small in Magnitude and Showed No Apparent Trend. Changes in Individual Laboratory Values Observed During This Study Seemed to Be sponta­

# Neous Events And, with One Exception (increased

# Liver enzymes), Were Not Considered Clinically Significant. Changes in Physical Examinations Were Similar Across Placebo and MAS XR Groups. A Statistically Significant Treatment Effect of MAS XR on Weight Was Observed (2-way ANCOVA,

# Pc.001): The Mean Weight Loss Between Baseline and Endpoint Was 1.1 ±1.8 Kg for the 20-mg Group (P=.O1), 2.5±2.3 Kg for the 40-mg Group (Pc.001), and 2.5±2.5 Kg for the 60-mg Group (Pc.001) Compared with a Mean Weight Gain of 0.1±2.7 Kg for Subjects Receiving Placebo. However, Weight Loss Was Not Considered Clinically Significant in Any Individual Subject.

# **Vital Signs**

# Mean Changes in Vital Signs Were Moderate and Not Considered Clinically Meaningful. A 2way ANCOVA Indicated a Statistically Significant Treatment Effect of MAS XR on Pulse (P=.025) and Systolic BP (P=.O15) but Not on Diastolic BP (P=. 135). Dunnett's Test for Multiple compari­ Sons Was Used to Further Analyze Mean Changes in Pulse and Systolic BP for Each MAS XR Group Compared with Placebo. Between Baseline and Endpoint, mean±SD Changes in Pulse (beats per minute) Were 4.2±9.7 (P=.582), 5.3±11.3 (P=.O53), 6.2±10.9 (P=.O16) in the 20-, 40-, and 60-mg Groups, Respectively, Compared with 1.9+10.4 Beats per Minute for the Placebo Group. For Systolic BP (mmHg), mean±SD Changes Were 0.3±11.2 (P=.191), 4.3±12.3 (P=.004 ), and 0.9+10.2

# (P=.219) In the 20, 40-, and 60-mg Groups,

# Respectively, Compared with -1.9±10.1 mmHg in the Placebo Group.

# A Post-hoc Outlier Analysis of Vital Signs Did Not Reveal a Dose-response Relationship for

# MAS XR 20 mg/day to MAS XR 60 mg/day for

# Pulse, Systolic BP, or Diastolic BP. Only One sub­

# Ject in Each Treatment Group Had a Pulse >110

# Beats per Minute at Any Point, and Changes >25

# Beats per Minute Were Transitory and Not Dose

# Dependent. Although MAS XR Appears to Have

# A Slight Effect on Systolic BP, the Outlier Analysis

# Did Not Indicate a Dose-response Relationship.

# A Small Number of Subjects Receiving Placebo

# Or MAS XR Had Generally Transient Systolic BP

# Increases of >20 mmHg and Few Subjects Had

# Two Consecutive Measurements >140 mmHg

# (one, Four, One, and Three Subjects in the pla­

# Cebo, 20-, 40-, and 60-mg MAS XR Groups,

# respectively). Similarly, Few Subjects Had dia­

# Stolic BP Increases of >10 mmHg From Baseline

# And Few Had Measurements >90 mmHg at Two

# Consecutive Visits (four, Three, One, and Three

# Subjects in the Placebo, 20-, 40-, and 60-mg

# MAS XR Groups, respectively). No Apparent

# Trends Were Identified for Any of the cardiovas­

# Cular Measurements with Respect to Absolute

# Increases From Baseline or Increases Above the

# Threshold Values on Consecutive Visits.

# **Electrocardiograms**

# The ECG Data Did Not Suggest Any Clinically

# Significant Cardiovascular Treatment Effects asso­

# Ciated with MAS XR in Adults. The Incidence of

# Qualitative ECG Abnormalities Was Similar for

# Subjects Receiving Placebo and for Subjects

# Receiving MAS XR, and the Abnormalities Were

# Either Normal Variants or They Were of Limited

# Clinical Relevance.

# Analyses of ECG Interval Measurements by

# 2-way ANCOVA Revealed No Clinically meaning­

# Ful Differences in PR (P=.354) or QRS (P=.204)

# Intervals From Baseline to Endpoint Between

# MAS XR (all doses) and Placebo. Statistically

# Significant Treatment Effects (ANCOVA) Were

# Noted Fo R Heart Rate (Pc.001) and F or QT (P=.OO2)

# And QTcB (P=.OO3) intervals.The Mean Changes

# For Each Treatment Group Were Not Considered

# Clinically Significant and Were Not Statistically

# Significant in Many Cases When Further ana­

# Lyzed by Dose (Dunnett's Test Was Used for the

# Construction of Treatment Group P-values).The

# Mean Changes From Baseline to Endpoint for

# Heart Rate (beats per minute) Were -2.0±9 for

# The Placebo Group; 2.6±9 for the 20-mg Group

# (P=.O35); 7.3±12 For the 40-mg Group (Pc.001),

# And 4.8±11 for the 60-mg Group (P<.001).The

# (Ft.211); -11.7±25 For the 40-mg Group (P=.OO1), and -7.1±21 for the 60-mg Group (P=.O47). For the QTcB Interval (milliseconds), Mean Changes From Baseline to Endpoint Were -2.8+19 for the Placebo Group; 1.0±21 for the 20-mg Group (Ft.101); 6.9±21 for the 40-mg Group (P=.OO7), and 5.6±22 for the 60-mg Group (P=.OO2). There Were No Apparent Dose-response Relationships. The Post-hoc Analysis Using the Fridericia Method of Correction Indicated No statisti­ Cally Significant Change From Baseline in the QTcF Intervals for MAS XR (all doses) Versus Placebo (ANCOVA, P=.132).The Mean QTcF Interval Changes (milliseconds) From Baseline to Endpoint Were—1.5±16 for the 20-mg Group (P=. 149);—1.1 ±21 for the 40-mg Group (P=.465); and—1.1 ±19 for the 60-mg Group (P=.O75). Dunnett's Test Was Used for the Construction of Treatment Group P-values. At Endpoint, Mean QT Intervals Did Not Exceed 436 Milliseconds for the MAS XR Groups or 433 Milliseconds for the Placebo Group. A Few 30-59 Milliseconds Increases Were Recorded, but These Changes Were Evenly Distributed Across the Placebo and MAS XR Groups. None of the Subjects in Any Treatment Group Experienced a >60 millisec­ Onds Increase in QT or QTcF Intervals.

# **DISCUSSION__________________________** In This Largest Adult ADHD Stimulant Study to Date, Results Indicate That Once-daily MAS XR 20 mg/day, 40 mg/day, and 60 mg/day Doses Were Safe and Effective in the Treatment of Adult ADHD, Combined Type. Subjects Treated with MAS XR Had Significantly Improved Symptoms Compared with Placebo, as Determined by the ADHD Rating Scale. Improved Symptoms Were Detected Within the First Treatment Week and Maintained through­ Out the Study. Although the Lowest Dose Used in This Study (20 mg/day) Led to Some improve­ Ment, the 40 mg/day and 60 mg/day Doses Led to Increasing Levels of efficacy.The Dose-response of Efficacy Seemed to Be Related to Symptom sever­ Ity: Adults with Mild Symptoms Had Significantly Greater Improvements with the Lowest MAS XR Dose (20 mg/day), Whereas Those with Severe Symptoms Had Significantly Greater improve­ Ments with the Highest Dose (60 mg/day). The Mean Effect Size for MAS XR 20, 40, and 60 mg/ Day Was 0.8 Based on ADHD Rating Scale Total Scores at Endpoint.

Analysis of the CGI-ETherapeutic Effects and Side Effects Scales Suggests That the Therapeutic Benefit of treat­ Ment Outweighs the Impact of Side Effects in the Higher-dose Groups, Particularly for Subjects with Higher Symptom Severity at Baseline.

An Effect Size of 0.6 Based on ADHD Rating Scale Total Scores Was Reported for a short­ Term, Placebo-controlled, Flexible-dose Study by Wilens and Colleagues36 of an Extendedrelease Bupropion Formulation (bupropion XL). Effect Sizes of 0.35 and 0.40 Based on the inves­ Tigator-rated CAARS-S-S Were Reported for Two Short-term, Placebo-controlled, Flexible-dose Atomoxetine Studies.33 Demographic charac­ Teristics and Baseline Symptom Severity Were Similar for Both the MAS XR and Atomoxetine Adult Study Samples,37 Whereas Subjects in the Bupropion XL Study Had More Severe symp­ Toms at Baseline (mean Baseline ADHD Rating Scale Score of 36) and 37% of the Subjects Had ADHD, Inattentive Subtype.36

# Limitations of This 4-week Study Relate pri­

# Marily to the Diagnostic Criteria for Adult ADHD,

# Combined Type. Because Many Adults with ADHD

# Are Below the Diagnostic Threshold for Hyper-

# activity/impulsivity, The Study Sample (ADHD,

# Combined type) May Not Be Representative of

# The General Adult ADHD Sample. In Addition,

# The Forced-dose-escalation Study Design May

# Have Underestimated Efficacy Because Subjects

# Assigned to Higher Doses Did Not Achieve Their

# Final Assigned Dose Until Midway Through the

# Study, or Overestimated Side Effects Because AE

# Reports Were Cumulative for All Doses.

## **CONCLUSION_________________________**

# This Short-term, Placebo-controlled, Forced-

# Dose-escalation Study Found That Once-daily

# Doses of MAS XR 20 Mg, 40 Mg, and 60 Mg

# Were Safe and Effective in Adults with ADHD.

# Treatment Response Based on Post-hoc anal­ Ysis Was Related to ADHD Symptom Severity:

# MAS XR 20 mg/day Was Effective for Subjects with Low Symptom Severity at Baseline, and a Trend Toward Dose Response for Efficacy Was

# Observed for Adults with Higher Baseline symp­ Tom Severity. All Doses of MAS XR Adequately Controlled ADHD Symptoms for up to 12 Hours

# And Were Well Tolerated, with No Evidence of a

# Dose-response Relationship for Safety assess­

# Ments. Because Treatment Response Appears to Depend on Baseline Symptom Severity, MAS XR Should Be Dosed to Optimal Efficacy Based on an Objective Symptom Rating Scale. Additional

# Research is Needed to Document Whether These Short-term Benefits Are Sustained During long­ Term Treatment. **CNS**

**INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Bipolar Mania SEROQUEL is indicated for the treatment of acute manic episodes asso­**

**ciated with bipolar I disorder, as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex. The efficacy of**

**SEROQUEL in acute bipolar mania was established in two 12-week monotherapy Inals and one 3-week adjunct ther­**

**apy trial of bipolar I patients initially hospitalized for up to 7 days for acute mama. Effectiveness has not been sys­**

**tematically evaluated in clinical trials for more than 12 weeks in monotherapy and 3 weeks in adjunct therapy.**

**Therefore, the physician who elects to use SEROQUEL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long­**

**term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient Schizophrenia SEROQUEL is indicated for the treat­** **men!** **of schizophrenia. The efficacy of SEROQUEL in schizophrenia was established in short-term (6-week) con-** **trolled trials of schizophrenic inpatients. The effect.veness of SEROQUEL in long-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks,** **has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use SEROQUEL for** **extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.**

**CONTRAINDICATIONS: SEROQUEL is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to this medication**

**or any of its ingredients.**

**WARNINGS: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Elderly patients with**

**dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared**

**to placebo. SEROQUEL (quetiapine) Is not approved lor the treatment ol patients with dementia-related psy­**

**chosis (see Boxed Warning). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). A potentially fatal symptom complex some­**

**times referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of**

**antipsychotic drugs, including SEROQUEL. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with SEROQUEL. Clinical mani­**

**festations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability**

**(irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may indude**

**elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation**

**of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the**

**clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g.,pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated**

**or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential**

**diagnosis include central anticholinergic tax city, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS)**

**pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other**

**drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treat­**

**ment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general**

**agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug**

**treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The**

**patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Tardive Dyskinesia: A syn­**

**drome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsy­**

**chotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderty**

**women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment,** **which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to** **cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become**

**irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs** **administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after rel­** **atively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyslcnesia.** **although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic** **treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and there­**

**by may possibly mask the undertying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term** **course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, SEROQUEL should be presented in a manner that** **is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be** **reserved tor patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs,** **and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropri­** **ate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment produc­** **ing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed peri­** **odically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on SEROQUEL, drug discontinuation should** **be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with SEROQUEL despite the presence of the syndrome.**

**Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Me 11 Itus: Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or** **hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including SEROQUEL.** **Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is qomplicated by the** **possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes meliitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing inci­** **dence of diabetes meliitus in the general population. Grven these confounders, the relationship between atypical** **antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiologi­** **cal studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients**

**treated with the atypical antipsychotics Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients** **treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes meliitus who** **are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with** **risk factors for diabetes meliitus (eg, obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical** **antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during** **treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia** **including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during** **treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia** **has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti­** **diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.** **PRECAUTIONS: General: Orthostatic Hypotension: SEROQUEL may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with** **dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably** **reflecting its a,-adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 1% (23/2567) of the patients treated with** **SEROQUEL, compared with 0% (0/607) on placebo and about 0.4% (2/527) on active control drugs. SEROQUEL** **should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarc­** **tion or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease or conditions** **which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia and treatment with antihypertensive** **medications). The risk of orthostatic hypotension ana syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to** **25 mg bid. If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration** **schedule is appropriate. Cataracts: The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine** **tzaalmafrtIn** **chronic in rtudiea(see** **Animal Toxicology), Lens changeshave** **alio been observed In pallente** **during long-term SEROQUEL treatment, but a causal relationship to SEROQUEL use has not been established.** **Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of** **the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as silt lamp exam or other appropriately sen­** **sitive methods, Is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6 month Intervals during** **chronic treatment. Seizures: During clinical trials, seizures occurred In 0.6% (18/2792) of patients treated with** **SEROQUEL compared to 0.2% (1/607)** or**placebo and 0.7% (4/527) on active control drugs. As with other antipsy­** **chotics SEROQUEL should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially** **lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more** **prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. Hypothyroidism: Clinical trials with SEROQUEL demonstrated a dose-** **related decrease in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range** **and was maximal in the first two to four weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression dur­** **ing more chronic therapy Generally, these changes were of no clinical significance and TSH was unchanged in most** **patients, and levels of TBG were unchanged. In nearly all cases, cessation of SEROQUEL treatment was associated** **with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. About 0.4% (12/2791)** **ol SEROQUEL patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Six of the patients with TSH increas­** **es needed replacement thyroid treatment. In the mama adjunct studies, where SEROQUEL was added to lithium or** **divalproate, 12% (24/196) of SEROQUEL treated patients compared to 7% (15/203) of placebo treated patients had** **elevated TSH leveis Of me SEROQUEL treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4** **levels. Cholesterol and Triglyceride Elevations: In schizophrenia trials, SEROQUEL treated patients had increases** **from baseline in cholesterol and triglyceride of 11% and 1 /%, respectively, compared to slight decreases for place­** **bo patients. These changes were only weakly related to the increases in weight observed in SEROQUEL treated** **patients. Hyperprolactinemia: Although an elevation of prolactin levels was not demonstrated in clinical trials with** **SEROQUEL, increased prolactin levels were observed In rat studies with this compound, and were associated with** **an increase in mammary gland neoplasia in rats (see Carcinogenesis). Tissue culture experiments indicate that** **approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent** **in vitro,a factor of potential importance if** **the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although distur­** **bances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevat­** **ing compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clin­**

**ical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration**

**of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive** **at this time Transaminase Elevations; Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases**

**(primarily ALT) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations**

**of > 3 times the upper limits ol the normal reference range in a pool of 3to 6-week placebo-controlled trials were**

**approximately 6% for SEROQUEL compared to 1% for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials, the proportions of**
