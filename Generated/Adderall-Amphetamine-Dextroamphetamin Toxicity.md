The  American  Psychiatric  Association  estimates  that  3-7%  of  US  school-aged  children  exhibit  attention-

deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD).  Adderall®  (amphetamine  dextroamphetamine)  and  a  variety  of 

brand  names  and  generic  versions  of  this  combination  are  available  by  prescription  to  treat  ADHD  and 

narcolepsy.  Both  immediate  and  sustained  release  products  are  used  as  are  single  agent  amphetamine 

medication. Knowing the exact agent ingested can provide information of dose labeled and length of

clinical effects. These drugs are used off label by college students for memory enhancement, test taking

ability,  and  for  study  marathons.  These  agents  are  DEA  Schedule  II  controlled  substances  with  high 

potential  for  abuse.  For  humans  with  ADHD  or  narcolepsy,  standard  recommended  dosage  is  5-60  mg 

daily.  Amphetamine  and  its  analogues  stimulate  the  release  of  norepinephrine  affecting  both a-  and  fi-

adrenergic  receptor  sites.  a-Adrenergic  stimulation  causes  vasoconstriction  and  an  increase  in  total 

peripheral  resistance.  0-Adrenergic  receptor  stimulation  leads  to  an  increase  in  heart  rate,  stroke  volume, 

and  skeletal  muscle  blood  flow.  Clinical  signs  of  AdderaHiS  overdose  in  humans  and  dogs  include 

hyperactivity,  hyperthermia,  tachycardia,  tachypnea,  mydriasis,  tremors,  and  seizures.  In  addition, 

Adderall  intoxication  in  dogs  has  been  reported  to  cause  hyperthermia,  hypoglycemia,  hypersegmenta-

tion  of  neutrophils,  and  mild  thrombocytopenia.  Diagnosis  can  be  confirmed  by  detecting  amphetamine 

in  stomach  contents  or  vomitus,  or  by  positive  results  obtained  in  urine  tests  for  illicit  drugs.  Treatment 

is  directed  at  controlling  life-threatening  central  nervous  system  and  cardiovascular  signs.  Seizures  can 

be  controlled  with  benzodiazepines,  phenothiazines,  pentobarbital,  and  propofol.  Cardiac  tachyarrhyth­

mias  can  be  managed  with  a  (3-blocker  such  as  propranolol.  Intravenous  fluids  counter  the  hyperthermia, 

assist  in  maintenance  of  renal  function,  and  help  promote  the  elimination  of  amphetamine  and  its 

analogues.  Prognosis  after  poisoning  with  Adderall®  depends  upon  the  severity  and  duration  of  clinical 

signs  at  presentation.  Differential  diagnoses  that  should  be  considered  in  cases  of  suspected  amphet­

amine  overdose  are  any  other  agents  that  can  cause  central  nervous  system  stimulation,  tremors,  and 

seizures.  This  article  discusses  our  present  understanding  of  Adderall®  intoxication  and  examines  3  dogs 

presented to our practice after ingestion of large amounts of the drug.

**Introduction**

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  the  most commonly  diagnosed  neurobehavioral  disorder  affecting  between 3%  and 7%  of  school-aged  children.1  This  disorder  results  in delayed  learning  ability,  impaired  academic  achievement,  and delayed  maturation.  Symptoms  include  having  trouble  in  con­ centrating  or  completing  simple  or  complex  tasks,  losing  or misplacing  important  items,  forgetfulness,  being  easily  distracted, hyperactivity,  restlessness,  impulsive  behavior,  inability  to get  along  with  others,  and  frequent  insubordination.  Once thought  to  regress  largely  in  adolescence,  a  growing  body  of work  suggests  that  ADHD  and  associated  disorders  persist  into adulthood  in  the  majority  of  cases.2  If  left  untreated,  this  disorder robs  many  young  people  of  their  potential  and  makes  it  difficult for  them  to  be  successful.  Only  a  trained  psychologist,  psychia­ trist,  or  physician  can  make  a  diagnosis  of  ADHD  with  certainty based  upon  past  behavior,  medical  testing,  and  clinical  observa­ tions.  Adderall®’  (amphetamine  and  dextroamphetamine  salts)  is a drug  used in  treating ADHD  and narcolepsy.3 The  standard daily dose i n hum ans i s 2.5- 60 mg  daily gi ven 1-3  times.4 A dderall  ® is available  as  a  tablet  in  5  mg,  7.5  mg,  10  mg,  12.5  mg,  15  mg, 20  mg,  and  30  mg  strengths.  It  is  also  available  in  an  extendedrelease  (XR)  form  as  a  15-mg  tablet.  It  is  a  controlled  substance available  only  by  prescription  from  a  licensed  physician  and,  like other  amphetamines,  is  a  schedule  II  drug  with  a  high  potential for abuse. In addition to the prescription use of the drug, recently

Adderall  ®  has  been  seen  to  be  abused  by  college  students  and 

young  people,  both  as  a  study  aid  during  examinations  and  as  a 

recreational  drug.1,4,5  Recently,  we  have  seen  3  dogs  present  for 

accidental  ingestion  of  Adderall®’.  In  this  discussion,  we  examine 

Adderall® overdose in companion animals.

Amphetamine  is  the  parent  compound  (a-methylphenylethyl-

amine) and  belongs to  the family  of phenylethylamines.  Numerous 

substitutions  of  the  phenylethylamine  backbone  are  possible,  and 

all  these  spin-off,  amphetamine-like  compounds  are  referred  to  as 

amphetamine  analogues.  Currently,  in  human  medicine,  there  are 

very  few  legitimate  medical  indications  for  amphetamine,  although 

it  is  still  used  to  treat  ADHD  and  narcolepsy,  and  for  short-term 

weight-reduction  therapy.  Amphetamine  itself  is  no  longer  used  in 

veterinary  medicine.6  Prior  to  the  enactment  of  the  Controlled 

Substance  Act  of  1970,  amphetamine  was  used  in  veterinary 

medicine  as  a  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  and  respiratory 

stimulant  to  overcome  the  depressive  effects  of  barbiturates  in 

dogs. Today, nearly all  the amphetamine exposures seen by  veter­

inarians  are  by  accidental  ingestions  of  prescription  drugs.  Occa­

sionally,  because  of  the  resurgence  of  amphetamine  abuse  by 

people,  animals  are  seen  after  ingesting  street  forms  such  as 

methamphetamine  and  methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA 

or  “ecstasy”).  Currently,  methamphetamine,  along  with  its  various 1527-3369/$-see front matter © 2013 Topics in Companion Animal Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. http://dx.doi.Org/10.1053/j.tcam.2013.03.002

analogues,  is  the  most  common  illicit  drug  produced  by  clandes­ tine  laboratories  in  the  United  States.  Owing  to  the  ease  and relative  low  cost  of  methamphetamine  production,  cost  to  the user  for  methamphetamine  is  less  than  one-third  the  price  of cocaine.  In  addition,  methamphetamine  has  a  much  longer  halflife  than  cocaine  QJ;(12  hours  compared  with  90  minutes)  and, therefore,  a  much  longer  duration of act ion.7 B oth  its  low cost  and prolonged  activity  contribute  to  the  popularity  of  methamphet­ amine and  its analogues.  Recently, the  productions of  “bath salts,” synthetic designer  drugs, have  also received  some notoriety  in the press.  These  products  can  contain  4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone)  that  transforms  to  cathinone  (benzylketoamphetamine),  which  is  thought  to  be  the  primary  active  agent  and produces  the  potency  and  clinical  signs  of  methcathinone  (com­ parable  to  that  of  methamphetamine).8  Small-animal  clinicians must  make  every  effort  to  keep  current  with  regard  to  both prescription  and  illicit  drugs  and  their  various  effects  if  they  are to provide effective treatment.

**Toxic Dose**

In  dogs,  the  oral  median  lethal  dose  for  amphetamine  can  be anywhere  from  9-11  mg/kg  for  methamphetamine  hydrochloride to  20-27  mg/kg  for  amphetamine  sulfate.9  The  intravenous median  lethal  dose  for  amphetamine  in  dogs  is  5.85  mg/kg.10  In humans,  death  from  amphetamine  has  been  recorded  with  as  low a  dose  as  1.5  mg/kg.11  In  rats,  the  oral  LD50  for  dextroamphet­ amine is 96.8 mg/kg.

**Toxicokinetics and Mechanism of Toxicity**

Pharmacologic  effects  of  amphetamine  are  complex  and diverse  but  their  primary  mechanism  of  action  is  the  release  of catecholamines,  primarily  dopamine  and  norepinephrine  from presynaptic  terminals.12  Amphetamine  and  its  analogues  work indirectly  to  cause  neuronal  stimulation  by  increasing  postsynaptic  catecholamines.  This  occurs  via  their  blocking  of  presy­ naptic  uptake  activity,  by  blocking  presynaptic  vesicular  storage, and  by  reducing  cytoplastic  destruction  of  catecholamines through  inhibition  of  mitochondrial  monoamine  oxidase.13 Amphetamines  lack  the  local  anesthetic  effects  on  cardiac  and nervous tissue that occur with cocaine.7 Although  a  number  of  receptors  have  been  implicated  in mediating  the  complex  physiological  response  to  amphetamine, the  underlying  clinical  effects  associated  with  amphetamine overdose  involve  excessive  stimulation  of  the  sympathetic  nerv­ ous system.  The rapid  and sustai ned activation  of the  sympathetic nervous  system  is  responsible  for  amphetamine’s  signature  of tachycardia,  hypertension,  mydriasis,  diaphoresis,  and  psycho­ motor  agitation.14  Furthermore,  the  prolonged  release  of  central monoamines  and  activation  of  the  sympathetic  nervous  system are  responsible  for  most  of  the  acute  recognizable  neurologic complications  associated  with  amphetamine  intoxication  (hyper­ thermia, agitation, and seizures). The  increased  norepinephrine  causes  sympathetic  nervous stimulation.  This  results  in  bronchodilation,  hyperglycemia,  and increases  in  heart  rate,  cardiac  output,  blood  pressure,  and  pupil size,  all  of  which  are  effects  noted  in  the  “flght-or-flight” response.15  CNS  effects  of  amphetamine  appear  to  be  mediated primarily  by  dopaminergic  alterations  affecting  changes  in  mood, excitation,  motor  movements,  and  appetite.  The  most  identifiable effects of amphetamines are those caused by catecholamine release and  resultant  stimulation  of  peripheral  a-  and  0-adrenergic  recep­ tors.  In  the  CNS,  increased  norepinephrine  at  the  locus  caeruleus 

mediates the anorectic and alerting effects,  and also some locomo­ tor stimulation.  The increase  in central  dopamine mediates  stereo­ typical behavior and some of the other locomotor activities.

Amphetamines are  highly lipid  soluble and  are readily  absorbed across most biological membranes. Tissue redistribution of amphet­ amine  is  extensive  and  high  lipid  solubility  leads  to  increased concentration  relative  to  serum  in  the  liver,  kidneys,  and  lung.15 After  oral  ingestion,  peak  plasma  concentrations  occur  within  2-3 hours.6 Amphetamines undergo  some hepatic metabolism and  both the  unchanged  forms  and  the  metabolites  of  the  drug  and  its analogues are  excreted into  the urine.  Some of the  metabolites are pharmacologically  active.  Generally,  metabolism  is  minimal  and most  amphetamines  are  excreted  as  the  parent  molecule.  The majority  of  amphetamines  are  eliminated  in  the  urine.  The  serum half-lives  of  amphetamine  and  its  analogue  compounds  are  urine pH  dependent  and  range  between  7  and  34  hours.16  The  more acidic  the  urine,  the  shorter  the  half-life  because  of  reduced  renal reabsorption of  ionized urinary  amphetamine.15 As  much as 30%  of amphetamine is excreted in the urine unchanged.

Amphetamines  have  been  shown  not  only  to  cause  seizures but  also  to  induce  stereotyped  repetitive  movements  in  both humans  and  animals.14171819  Non-goal  directed  repetitive behaviors  like  circling,  head  bobbing,  facial  tics,  licking,  lip smacking,  foot  paddling,  and  sniffling  have  been  described  in  a variety  of  animals  that  were  given  amphetamines.17  These  signs disappear  while  they  are  sleeping.  With  time,  treatment,  and cessation  of  amphetamine  use,  these  signs  resolve.  Although  the neurologic  mechanism  behind  this  repetitive  stereotypic  behav­ ior  is  not  well  understood,  it  appears  to  involve  dopamine.14 Increases  in  stereotypic  locomotor  activities  (circling,  etc.)  and, recently,  dopamine-mediated  decreases  in  acetylcholine  have been implicated.1417

**Clinical Signs**

Onset  of  clinical  signs  of  amphetamine  toxicity  can  vary  with the  formulation  of  the  product  ingested.  Signs  may  be  seen almost  immediately  or  can  be  delayed  for  several  hours  with ingestion  of  XR  formulations.  Amphetamines  act  through  causing neuronal  stimulation  by  increasing  postsynaptic  catecholamines (norepinephrine  and  dopamine).  An  increase  in  postsynaptic norepinephrine  causes  stimulation  of  the  sympathetic  nervous system.15  Release  of  norepinephrine  stimulates  both  a-  and  Padrenergic  receptor  sites.12  Bronchodilation  and  increases  in heart  rate,  cardiac  output,  and  blood  pressure  all  occur  as  a result.  Recently,  myocardial  infarction  has  been  reported  after ingestion  of  Adderall®.20  In  addition,  Adderall®  XR  was  tempo­ rarily  taken  off  the  market  in  Canada  due  to  increases  in  cardiacrelated  diseases.20  Animals  and  humans  also  exhibit  mydriasis, hypersalivation,  hyperthermia,  and  tachycardia.6  The  CNS  effects of  amphetamine  are  thought  to  be  mediated  primarily  by  dop­ aminergic  alterations  and  include  ataxia,  excitation,  and  changes in  motor  movements,  vocalizations,  tremors,  and  seizures.15  In addition,  repetitive  stereotypic  motions  may  be  observed.1418 Table  1 summarizes  the  most  common  clinical  signs  observed  in instances of amphetamine intoxication.

**Table 2** A minimum database for amphetamine intoxication

•  Complete blood count •  Biochemical profile •  Coagulation panel •  Blood gas evaluation to determine acid-base status (if available) •  Blood pressure •  Electrocardiogram •  Body temperature check for hyperthermia •  Seizure watch

**Minimum Database**

Minimum  database  in  cases  of  amphetamine  poisoning  should include  a  complete  blood  count,  a  biochemical  profile,  a  coagu­ lation  panel,  an  electrocardiogram  (ECG),  and  a  blood  pressure analysis.  A  blood  gas  evaluation  to  determine  acid-base  status should  be  run,  if  possible.  A  urinalysis  should  be  performed  to monitor  myoglobinuria.  Animals  should  be  closely  observed  for hyperthermia  and  seizures.  A  summary  of  a  minimum  database necessary  to  evaluate  an  animal  following  real  or  suspected amphetamine toxicity is included in Table 2.

**Diagnostics and Confirming Tests**

Amphetamines  can  be  identified  in  vomitus,  stomach  con­ tents,  and  urine  by  human  toxicologic  laboratories.  A  good relationship  with  the  toxicology  section  of  a  local  human  hospital or  a  local  human  toxicologist  can  have  many  benefits.  Consulta­ tion  with  a  diagnostic  toxicologist  should  always  be  sought before  collection  and  submission  to  prevent  nondiagnostic  sam­ plings  and  to  improve  accuracy.  In  addition  to  local  hospitals, regional  veterinary  teaching  hospitals  and  poison  centers  can likewise  be  very  helpful.  Amphetamines  would  test  positive  (+) on  human  amphetamine  or  methamphetamine  urine  tests,  but these  screening  tests  have  not  been  validated  for  use  in  animals. Other  ways  that  can  help  confirm  amphetamine  poisoning  but  are not  diagnostic  are  as  follows:  (a)  sinus  tachycardia  and  ventric­ ular  arrhythmias  on  ECG,  (b)  metabolic  acidosis  confirmed  by blood  gas  analysis,  (c)  an  increase  in  blood  pressure  (hyper­ tension),  (d)  myoglobinuria  secondary  to  rhabdomyolysis  identi­ fied by urinalysis, and (e) hyperthermia. Finally,  as  in  other  animals  suffering  from  hyperpyrexia,  the blood  may  reflect  heat-induced  damage  of  erythrocytes,  neutro­ phils,  and  platelets.21,22  Such  hematologic  changes  associated with  Adderall  toxicity  in  a  dog  have  been  described  (metarubricytosis,  hypersegmentation  and  pyknosis  of  neutrophils,  and thrombocytopenia).4  However,  these  changes  were  not  consistent in  every  dog  presented  to  our  hospital  for  dextroamphetamine ingestion.  A  list  of  diagnostic  and  confirming  tests  to  aid  in establishing definite amphetamine toxicity are shown in Table 3.

**Table 3** Diagnostics and confirmatory test for amphetamine poisoning

**Treatment**

Just  as  in  any  poisoning,  initiation  of  treatment  must  not supersede  the  essentials  of  emergency  medicine.  Temperature, respiration,  heart  rate  and  rhythm  must  all  be  strictly  moni­ tored  and  never  overlooked.  The  mainstays  of  treatment  for amphetamine-poisoned  animals  are  supportive  care,  control  of behavior,  management  of  arrhythmias,  stopping  seizures,  and temperature  reduction.  There  remains  no  specific  antidote  for amphetamine  intoxication.  Hyperthermia,  a  frequent  manifes­ tation  of  this  poisoning  syndrome,  must  be  swiftly  managed with  immediate  intervention.  Animals  seen  early  enough, within  30  minutes  of  ingestion  and  showing  no  signs,  can  be treated  by  emesis  and  administration  of  activated  charcoal.  The efficacy  of  the  use  of  activated  charcoal  in  treating  amphet­ amine  exposure  has  been  well  documented  in  mice;  sustained or  XR  forms  of  the  drug  may  require  repeated  doses  of  activated charcoal.

Seizures  can  be  successfully  treated  using  benzodiazepines, barbiturates,  or  propofol.  Although  benzodiazepines  have  been reported  to  exacerbate  the  neurologic  effects  of  amphetamine,6,24 these developments  have not  been seen  with diazepam  use at  our hospital.  Chlorpromazine  (given  intravenously  at  10-18  mg/kg) prevented  lethal  effects  from  amphetamine  in  experimentally dosed  dogs  and  is  also  recommended  for  controlling  CNS  excita­ tion  and  seizures  owing  to  its  dopamine  excitatory  receptor antagonist  properties.23  Acepromazine  (given  intravenously  at 0.05 mg/kg)  has also  been recommended.  The phenothiazines  are also  used  to  manage  the  agitation,  but  they  must  be  utilized recognizing  that  they  may  lower  seizure  threshold.  The  serotonin antagonist  cyproheptadine  has  also  been  suggested  to  combat agitation.  Dosage  recommended  is  1.1  mg/kg  given  orally  in  dogs and  2-4  mg  total  dosage  per  cat.  Hyperthermia  should  be  dealt with  early  and  corrected  using  intravenous  fluids,  fans,  ice  packs, or  cool-water  baths.  Animals  must  be  continually  monitored  to identify  subsequent  hypothermia.  Intravenous  fluids  are  neces­ sary  not  only  to  regulate  body  temperature  but  also  to  maintain renal  function,  protect  the  kidneys  from  myoglobinuria,  and  to promote  elimination  of  amphetamines.  Although  urinary  acid­ ification  can  significantly  increase  the  elimination  and  decrease the  half-lives  of  amphetamine  and  its  analogues,  this  pH  manip­ ulation  does  not  decrease  toxicity  and  may  increase  the  risk  of renal  compromise  and  acute  tubular  necrosis  from  rhabdomyol­ ysis  by  precipitating  ferrihemate  in  the  renal  tubules.  Urinary acidification  using  ascorbic  acid  (20-30  mg/kg  PO)  or  ammonium chloride  (100-200  mg/kg  PO  divided  QID)  has  been  shown  to increase  the  elimination  of  amphetamine  in  a  variety  of  species but  this  procedure  is  contraindicated  if  the  animal’s  acid-base status  cannot  be  monitored  or  if  myoglobinuria  is  already present.6  The  intense  muscle  activity  caused  by  tremors  and seizures  can  result  in  metabolic  acidosis  and  rhabdomyolysis. Fluid  therapy,  but  not  urine  acidification,  should  be  employed  to treat these animals.

**Table 4** Management of animals with amphetamine toxicity

Gastric decontamination •  If brought in within 30 min of ingestion, induce emesis Apomorphine (dogs): 0.04 mg/kg IV

•  If animal is alert, start activated charcoal therapy Extended-release formulations may require repeated doses

Agitation •  Phenothiazines: acepromazine (0.05 mg/kg IV) Chlorpromazine (0.5 mg/kg IV)

•  Cyproheptadine: serotonin antagonist Dogs—1.1 mg/kg PO Cats—24 mg per cat total

Tachycardia-tachyarrhythmias •  Propranolol (0.020.06 mg/kg IV)—0-blocker •  Tremors •  Methocarbamol (50100 mg/kg IV)

Seizures •  Phenobarbital (34 mg/kg IV to effect) •  Inhalant anesthetics (isoflurane and sevoflurane) •  Propofol CRI •  Diazepam (0.25-0.5 mg/kg IV to effect)

Hyperthermia •  Intravenous fluids •  Fans •  Ice packs •  Cool baths •  Chemical sedation •  Monitor continually to avoid hypothermia

CRI, continuous rate infusion.

Tachyarrhythmias  and  tachycardia  can  be  controlled  with  Pblockers  such  as  propranolol  (0.02-0.06  mg/kg  given  intrave­ nously)  or  metoprolol  (0.1  mg/kg  PO).  Ventricular  dysrhythmias should  be  treated  with  lidocaine  (0.025-0.08  mg/kg/min  infu­ sion).  Tremors  can  be  managed  with  methocarbamol  (50100  mg/kg  given  intravenously).  Seizure  activity  can  be  treated by  benzodiazepines  (diazepam  0.25-0.5  mg/kg  given  intrave­ nously)  or  by  barbiturates  given  to  effect  (phenobarbital  34  mg/kg  given  intravenously).  Animals  must  be  kept  quiet  and sensory  stimulation  should  be  kept  to  a  minimum.  Intractable seizures  can  be  managed  with  inhalant  anesthetics  (isoflurane and  sevoflurane)  or  on  a  propofol  continuous  rate  infusion. Sedation  prevents  further  muscle  contraction,  stops  tremors  and seizures,  and  thereby  lowers  heat  production.  In  conclusion, recently,  intravenous  lipid  therapy  has  been  considered  for  use with  regard  to  the  more  lipophilic  amphetamine  analogue  com­ pounds.6 Table  4 summarizes  therapeutic  treatment  to  an  animal suffering from amphetamine toxicity.

**Discussion**

Adderall®  (amphetamine  salts  and  dextroamphetamine  salts) is  a  prescription  drug  commonly  prescribed  for  children  with ADHD.  Currently,  it  is  estimated  that  between  3%  and 7%  of school-aged  children  in  the  United  States  have  some  degree  of ADHD.  In  addition,  Adderall®’  is  becoming  more  commonly abused  by  young  people  and  college  students  with  nonprescrip­ tion  use.  The  drug  is  widely  prescribed,  found  in  a  surprising 

percentage  of  American  homes,  and  has  a  high  potential  for abuse.  The  greater  availability  and  use  of  this  drug  increases  the chances for  inadvertent animal exposure.  Recently, we saw  3 dogs present  to  our  emergency  room  that  had  ingested  large  amounts of Adderall®.

In  the  last  12  months,  3  dogs  presented  to  our  practice  after ingesting  various  amounts  of  Adderall®.  Dog  1  was  a  7-year-old, spayed  female  border  collie  (21  kg)  that  had  consumed  20  20-mg tablets  at  an  unknown  amount  of  time  before  admission  to  our emergency  room.  This  amounted  to  400  mg  ingested  or  approx­ imately  10  mg/kg  body  weight.  Upon  presentation,  the  dog  was recumbent,  had  bilaterally  dilated  pupils,  was  tremoring,  and  had 2  short  seizures  on  the  way  to  the  hospital.  The  dog  had  a  rectal temperature  of  41  °C.  When  aroused,  the  dog  would  repeatedly circle  to  the  right  and  bring  the  right  front  paw  across  the  muzzle repetitively.

Dog  2  was  a  4.5-year-old,  neutered  male  Jack  Russell  terrier (11  kg)  that  had  consumed  12  15-mg  Adderall®  XR  (extended release)  tablets  2  hours  before  admission.  This  would  represent 

180  mg  ingested  or  17  mg/kg  body  weight.  At  presentation,  the dog  was  alert,  responsive  but  agitated,  had  bilaterally  dilated pupils  but  showed  no  tremors  or  seizures.  Rectal  temperature was 42°C. Once i n a cage, the  dog continually circled, would  not lie down, and was restless.

Dog 3  was a  5-year-old, spayed  female shepherd-cross  (33 kg) that  had  consumed  25-30  20-mg  Adderall®’  tablets  1  hour  before admission.  This  represented  approximately  600  mg  ingested  or nearly  18  mg/kg  body  weight.  At  the  time  of  admission,  the  dog was  alert  and  responsive  but  extremely  agitated  and  revealed  a rectal  temperature  of  41.5°C.  The  dog  had  bilaterally  dilated pupils. The  dog was  given apomorphine  (0.04 mg/kg  IV) t o induce emesis  but  did  not  vomit.  Two  hours  after  admission  to  our intensive  care  unit,  the  dog  became  recumbent,  started  to  tremor, and had  1 short  (60 second)  seizure. Postictally,  the dog  displayed the  stereotypical  repetitive  behavior  (circling  and  repeated  paw lifting)  that  Dog  1  also  manifested.  The  normal  daily  dosage  for Adderall®  in  humans  with  ADHD  or  narcolepsy  varies  from 5-60  mg.  The  dogs  in  our  study  ingested  from  3-10  times  the highest daily dosage prescribed for humans.

Upon  presentation  to  our  hospital,  all  3  dogs  were  given thorough  physical  exams,  had  body  temperature,  mentation, and  heart  rate  rhythm  assessed.  Next  blood  samples  were  drawn for  a  CBC  and  a  biochemical  profile  panel.  All  had  electrocardio­ grams  run.  After  the  blood  samples  were  taken,  intravenous catheters  were  put  in  and  all  3  of  the  dogs  were  started  on  0.9% normal  saline  to  counter  their  hyperthermia  and  to  support kidney  function.  All  3  were  started  on  phenobarbital  (3  mg/kg IV)  and  methocarbamol  (50  mg/kg  IV)  to  control  tremors  and seizures,  supported  with  intravenous  fluids,  and  were  regularly monitored for status of body temperature.

The  ECGs  in  all  3  dogs  revealed  tachycardia  (dog  1:  180 beats/min,  dog  2:  180  beats/min,  and  dog  3:  192  beats/min)  but no  premature  ventricular  contractions  or  other  arrhythmias.  After 8 hours  of  intravenous f luids,  the  fever  in  all 3  dogs resolved  (dog 

1: 37.0°C,  dog 2:  37.5°C, and  dog 3:  37.3°C). Upon  administration of  the  phenobarbital,  the  tremors,  seizures,  and  stereotypical repetitive  behaviors  all  ceased.  No  more  seizures  were  observed and  by  the  second  day  after  presentation,  all  the  neurologic  signs (circling,  repetitive  motions)  had  resolved.  All  3  dogs  were clinically  normal  (no  fever,  no  pupillary  dilation,  no  tremors,  no seizures,  and no  repetitive mot ion behaviors,  and were  eating and drinking)  when  they  were  released  on  the  third  day  of  hospital­ ization. The dogs were sent home on no medication.

The  results  of  the  complete  blood  count  for  the  3  dogs revealed  no  anemia  and  a  normal  white  blood  cell  count.  All  3 dogs showed elevated lactate levels at presentation that resolved

with  fluid  therapy.  The  3  dogs  shared  a  mild  hypoglycemia:  dog 1 (60  mg/dL);  dog  2  (64  mg/dL);  and dog  3 ( 58 mg/ dL).  Hypoglyce­ mia  has  been  previously  reported  in  several  different  instances  of hyperthermia.  The  hypoglycemia  in  these  cases  may  have resulted  from  increased  glucose  utilization  owing  to  the  tremors and  seizures,  increased  glucose  utilization  owing  to  the  increased catecholamine  release,  decreased  glucose  production  owing  to mild  liver  dysfunction  due  to  increased  metabolism,  or  a  gener­ alized  increase  in  adenosine  triphosphate  demand  combined  with the  high  body  temperature.  In  a  previous  report  of  Adderall® toxicity  in  a  dog,  the  blood  work  revealed  mild  hypoglycemia, mild  thrombocytopenia,  hypersegmented  neutrophils,  and  sev­ eral  pylenotic  nuclei.4  Also  in  that  previous  report,  the  dog showed  coagulation  abnormalities  that,  together  with  the described  thrombocytopenia,  might  predispose  animals  ingesting large  amounts  of  Adderall  ®  to  the  development  of  disseminated intravascular  coagulation.  This  is  probably  the  result  of  hyper­ thermia.  Thrombocytopenia  and  coagulation  abnormalities  are commonly seen  in dogs  with fever  and heat-induced  illnesses.20"22 Disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  is  believed  to  occur  in heat  stroke  as  a  result  of  heat-induced  damage  to  endothelial cells  with  subsequent  activation  of  platelets  and  the  coagulation cascade.  The  results  of  blood  work  for  the  dogs  in  our  s==tudy  are == included in Tables 5 and 6.

Prognosis  for  Adderall  ®  ingestion  is  similar  for  other  amphet­ amines  and  depends  upon  severity  and  duration  of  clinical  signs. Trauma,  hypoxia,  hyperthermia,  or  even  cerebral  edema  can result  from  myoglobinuria.  If  the  animal  survives  the  initial physiological  changes  and  biochemical  abnormalities,  and  if  the CNS,  cardiac  signs,  and  kidney  problems  are  swiftly  addressed, the  prognosis  for  a  full  recovery  is  good.  For  most  dogs  managed aggressively  (fluids  and  seizure  control)  few  permanent  problems should  be  expected.  Although  the  clinical  signs  of  this  toxicity  are dramatic,  most  animals  show  no  long-term  clinical  consequences of Adderall®’ toxicity.

Prevention  of  accidental  Adderall®’  intoxication  in  dogs  (or  for that  matter  any  drug)  depends  upon  responsible  storage  of  all medications.  Both  human  and  animal  medications  should  be stored  in  drug  cabinets  with  a  working  latch.  No  drugs  should be  kept  on  night  stands  next  to  beds.  All  old  human  medication should  be  accounted  for,  returned  to  the  pharmacy,  and  incin­ erated. They  should never  be thrown  into garbage  cans or  flushed down  the  toilet.  Some  pharmacies  charge  for  this  incineration service  but  it  is  worth  not  having  animals  or  children  blunder across  dangerous drugs  or having  toxic molecules  enter our  water supply.  Periodically,  the  DEA  hosts  medication  take  back  days. Information  about  programs  in  your  area  can  be  found  at http:// ==www.deadiversion.u==sdoi.gov/drugdisposal/index.html== ======or  call  the national  poison  hotline  at  800-222-1222.  These  simple  measures can  be  life  saving  and  prevent  discarded  drugs  from  contaminat­ ing our environment.

Despite  the  severity  of  clinical  signs  in  dogs  following Adderall®  ingestion  (which  can  be  quite  severe),  if  no  kidney problems  develop  as  a  result  of  the  poisoning,  there  are  no specific  or  pathognomic  histopathologic  lesions  consistent  with this intoxication.24

Any  agent  that  can  cause  CNS  stimulation,  tremors,  and seizures  must  be  included  in  a  differential  diagnosis  list  for Adderall®  toxicosis.  These  would  include  a  host  of  substances such  as  methylxanthines,  metaldehyde,  tremorgenic  mycotoxins, pseudoephedrine,  strychnine,  tricyclic  antidepressants,  5-fluo­ rouracil,  organochlorine  insecticides,  organophosphates  and  car­ bamate  insecticides,  nicotine,  4-aminopyridines,  sodium  ion toxicosis,  lead,  serotonergic  medications,  and  herbal  preparations containing  ma  huang,  guarana  root,  or  ephedra.6  Molecules  like

these  must  all  be  considered  before  arriving  at  a  particular 

suspect  for  the  poisoning.  A  partial  list  of  differential  diagnoses for amphetamine toxicosis is included in Table 7.

To  arrive  at  a  correct  toxicologic  diagnosis,  the  clinicians  must assemble  a  coherent  picture  based  upon  history,  clinical  signs, laboratory  results,  and  appropriate  response  to  therapy.  Animals 

ingesting  toxic  substances  remain  among  the  most  challenging cases  faced  by  small-animal  clinicians.  Nevertheless,  through  the judicious  use  of  available  resources  (local  toxicology  laboratories, local  hospitals,  regional  poison  centers,  local  toxicologists, regional  veterinary  colleges,  the  national  poison  hotline  (800222-1222),  the  national  animal  poisoning  hotline  (888-4264435),  and  an  awareness  of  the  current  literature  and  treatment 

protocols),  many  seemingly  devastating  poisonings  can  have  very favorable outcomes.
