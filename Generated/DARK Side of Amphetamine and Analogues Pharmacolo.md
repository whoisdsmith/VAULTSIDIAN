**■ INTRODUCTION** As  a  contribution  to  the  call  for  DARK  Classics  in  Chemical Neuroscience  in  2017,  this  Viewpoint  is  to  reflect  on  underlying mechanisms  behind  the  addictive  central  nervous  system (CNS)  excitation  that  rushes  in  with  abuse  of  amphetamine (APA)  and  its  analogues  like  methamphetamine  (MA) (Figure 1A).  As  with  any  other  addictive  drug  and  chemical,  all  that  is ====needed  to  get  an  individual  hooked  to  MA  is  the  first ====experience  of  its  “rush”,  an  event  that  is  so  very  likely  to  occur ====in  gatherings  and  parties  these  days.  The  rest  of  the  job  of ====getting  an  individual  addicted  to  APA  or  MA  is  done  by  the ====recalls  of  the  highs  by  the  temporal  lobe  of  the  brain,  that  is ====known  for  keeping  the  virtual  memories  of  such  events.  These ====memory recalls  are nearly  impossible to  resist in  the near  future ====and coul d be  best  referred as  the revisit  calls which  are hard,  if ====not impossible,  to resist.  The next  exposures and  the buildup  of addiction  takes  a  natural  course,  with  the  denials  by  the individual  that  “I  am  not  hooked  to  it  at  all”  and  “my  use  of  this is  purely  occasional.”  We  as  humans  would  honestly  confess that  the  same  rule  applies  to  not  so  very  dangerous,  but addictive social drinks  like coffee and tea. In the case  of MA and similar  drugs like  cocaine, t he addi ction bui lds up  over a  period of  time  until  it  completely  grips  the  user  to  defy  the  abovementioned  confident  denial  and  initiates  the  downward  spiral of  the  most  dangerous  kind.  Briefly,  this  Viewpoint  addresses the 1.  Chemistry  and  sites  of  amphetamine  bindings  to  induce its CNS action 2.  Effects of methamphetamine on organs and tissues 3.  The  nature  of  neurochemical  imbalance  at  the  level  of synapses in amphetamine addiction 4.  Management of methamphetamine addiction

# **Syndromic Manifestation, and Management of Amphetamine** **Addiction** Abdul Mannan Baig* * The Aga Khan University, 78400 Karachi, Pakistan **ABSTRACT:** The  threat  imposed  by  the  use  of  psychoactive,  illicit  drugs  on  human  health  and  the  cost  of  rehabilitation  of  the 

# affected individuals  is nothing  less than  billions of  dollars per  year. Of  the psychoactive  substance abuse  drugs are  amphetamine and  its  analogues  like  methamphetamine.  This  Viewpoint  intends  to  draw  the  attention  of  readers  toward  the  neurological  basis of “falling  a prey”  to  methamphetamine.  Attention  has  been pai d t oward a r apid  desensitizing  attribute  that  develops  shortly  after the  repetitive  use  of  drugs  belonging  to  sympathomimetic  agents  of  this  group.  Also  summarized  are  the  changes  in  physical characteristics and  behavioral changes  that could  herald the  loved ones  around the  methamphetamine abuser  to seek  the help  of healthcare  professionals  before  permanent  and  irreversible  neurological  damage  ensues.  A  brief  pharmacology  of methamphetamine  also  precedes  the  management  of  these  patients,  for  which  no  standard  procedures  exist  at  present. **KEYWORDS:** Methamphetamine, amphetamine, crystal meth, ice, crank, psychoactive drugs, illicit drugs

**BINDINGS FOR ADDITIVE ACTION** Amphetamine  (APA)  (racemic  //-phenylisopropylamine)  is  one 

of  the  most  potent  sympathomimetic  amines  in  inducing  an 

excited  state  of  the  CNS (Figure 1A). Of  its  different  isomers, the  D-isomer  (dextroamphetamine)  is  3—4  times  more  potent than  the  L-isomer.  APA  and  its  analogue  methamphetamine 

====(MA) ====(Figure  1) ====acts  on  the  CNS  to  release  dopamine  (DA) ====and other  biogenic amines  and to  inhibit neuronal  and vesicular ====monoamine  transporters  (VMAT2)  and  monoaminoxidase 

====(MAO). ====1,2====  The  effect  of  amphetamine  as  a  CNS  stimulant, ====its  anorectic  effect,  and  at  least  an  element  of  its  locomotor­ ====stimulating  action  presumably  are  mediated  by  release  of ====noradrenaline  from  central  noradrenergic  neurons.  Some ====aspects  of  locomotor  activity  and  the  stereotypical  behavior ====induced  by  amphetamine  probably  result  from  the  release  of 

====dopamine  from  dopaminergic  nerve  terminals  in  the  neo­ ====striatum ====(Figure ====IB).  Higher  doses  are  required  to  produce behavioral  effects,  and  disturbances  of  perception  as  well  as overt psychosis  may occur,  with the  latter being  possibly due  to release  of  5-HT  from  serotonergic  neurons  and  of  dopamine  in the  mesolimbic  system.  In  low  doses,  amphetamine  increases the  concentration  of  dopamine  in  the  synaptic  cleft (Figure 1A) in  three  ways:1  (1)  Amphetamine  can  interact  with  dopamine 

containing  synaptic  vesicles,  releasing  free  dopamine  into  the nerve  terminal.  (2)  It  can  bind  to  the  presynaptic  membrane  of 

dopaminergic  neurons  and  induce  the  release  of  dopamine from  the  nerve  terminal.  (3)  Amphetamine  can  bind  to  the 

dopamine  reuptake  transporter,  causing  it  to  act  in  reverse  and transport free dopamine out of the nerve terminal.

**Figure  1.** Shows  a  CNS  synapse  representative  of  biogenic  amines  as  neurotransmitters  and  the  sites  of  action  of  amphetamine  and methamphetamine.  Structures  of  both  of  these  drugs  resemble  the  biogenic  amines.  APA  and  MA  (blue  dots)  enter  the  axonal  terminals  in  dilferent areas  of  the  brain  by  a  reuptake  pump  that  normally  transports  biogenic  amines  (A).  Within  the  axonal  terminal,  VMAT2  [yellow  circle]  transports APA  and  MA  into  the  secretory  vesicles  to  replace  the  biogenic  amines  in  a  quantitative  manner  (A).  These  biogenic  amines  like  dopamine, adrenaline,  noradrenaline,  and  serotonin  escape  the  axon  to  reach  the  synaptic  cleft  and  bind  the  receptors  to  produce  the  CNS  stimulation  (B)  and euphoric  elfects  observed  with  the  use  of  APA  and  MA.  Chronic  use  induces  a  short-developing  tolerance  called  tachyphylaxis  in  which  the  vesicles become  depleted  of  the  biogenic  amines.  Amphetamine  is  released  into  the  synaptic  cleft  with  subsequent  nerve  discharges  and  acts  as  a  “false neurotransmitter”.

**■  EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE ON ORGANS AND** **TISSUES** **Neurological  and  Behavioral  Effects.** Psychic  effects  of an  oral  dose  of  10—30  mg  manifest  by  causing  wakefulness, alertness,  and  reduced  fatigue;  mood  elevation,  with  improved self-confidence, ability to concentrate and an increase in speech. APA  and  analogues  often  produce  elation  and  euphoria. Performances  of  mental  tasks  are  noted  to  improve.1  Physical performance  of  sportsmen  and  athletes  gets  notably  improved, which  becomes  the  basis  of  it  abuse  in  these  professionals. Depression  and  fatigue  often  follow  during  prolonged  use  or upon using  large doses. Many  individuals given APA  experience headache,  palpitation,  dizziness,  vasomotor  disturbances, agitation,  confusion,  dysphoria,  apprehension,  delirium,  or fatigue.  In  general,  amphetamine  extends  the  period  of sufficient  performance  before  fatigue  takeover.  The  need  for sleep  may  be  postponed,  but  it  cannot  be  avoided  for  an indefinite period. **Body  Weight  and  Hunger.** Amphetamine  has  been  used for  weight  loss  in  obese  individuals,  and  this  effect  is  entirely due to  a reduced  appetite caused  by this  drug. Tolerance  to the appetite suppression develops quickly in humans. **Analgesia.** Amphetamine  and  some  other  sympathomi­ metic  amines  have  a  miniature  analgesic  effect  that  is  not therapeutically useful. APA can  enhance the analgesia produced by morphine and other related opioids. **Respiratory  Function.** Amphetamine  stimulates  the respiratory  center  in  the  brainstem,  increasing  the  respiratory minute  volume  by  increasing  the  rate  and  depth  of  respiration. However,  its  action  is  seen  to  appreciably  stimulate  breathing when  the  center  of  respiration  is  under  inhibition  caused  by morphine and hypnotic drugs. **■  AMPHETAMINE ADDICTION ASSOCIATED SIGNS** **AND SYMPTOMS** APA  and MA  are  powerful  CNS  stimulants,  that  produce  a hi gh that  can  last  up  to  12  h.  Both  of  these  drugs  exert  an  appetite 

suppressing  effect  that  has  made  them  appealing,  particularly among  women  interested  in  losing  weight.  The  crystallized form  of  MA,  often  referred  to  as  “speed”,  “ice”,  “crank”,  or simply  “meth”,  is  a  powerfully  addictive  synthetic  drug  which  is typically  snorted,  injected,  or  swallowed.  MA  is  often administered  several  times  over  the  course  of  many  days  in runs  or  binges.2  However,  tolerance  and  eventually  tachyphy­ laxis  to  APA  and  MA  occur  rapidly,  causing  the  addicts  to  take increasing  amounts  or  more  frequent  doses  as  they  chase  a 

diminishing  high  (an  effect  that  is  not  possible  because  of tachyphylaxis).  Severe  addiction  invariably  takes  hold  at  this point.  Because  of  the  process  by  which  this  form  of  MA  is manufactured,  crystal  meth  is  full  of  punitive  chemicals,  filth, and  additives  that  make  this  form  of  the  drug  so  very 

MA  abusers  often  have  pupillary  dilation,  their  heart  rate increases,  and  they  may  show  signs  of  physical  exertion 

(sweating  and  increased  body  temperature).  They  may  seem particularly  frantic,  edgy,  or  angry  without  a  reasonable  cause. Because  it  has  CNS  stimulant  effects,  users  will  often  go  for 

extended  periods,  even  days  at  a  time,  without  sleep  with  a markedly  diminished  appetite.  Looking  bony,  drawn,  or  starved may  be  the  first  clue  toward  MA  addiction,  but  when  coupled with  other  neurological  and  cardiovascular  symptoms  of  MA abuse  these  signs  should  be  taken  very  seriously.  Over  long periods of  addiction, the  harsh chemicals  in the  drug cause  oral cavity  erosions  and  deterioration  of  the  gums  and  teeth. Eventually,  psychosis  follows  and  clinically  symptoms  of induced  by  amphetamines  are  very  similar  to  those  of  acute schizophrenia.

**Cognitive  Deficits.** With  chronic  exposure  to  APA  and MA,  deficits  in  learning,  memory,  perception,  and  problem solving  are  seen.  The  exact  mechanism  is  unknown.  As mentioned  in  sections  below,  impairment  of  the  functions  of parallel  running  neurotransmitter  systems  also  may  occur  in APA  and  MA  abusers.  Such  a  parallel  neurotransmitter  system includes the cholinergic pathway, and studies have shown that, **2300**DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00137

What  begins  as  a  party  drug  with  occasional  use,  like  any  other addictive  drug  its  use  becomes  more  frequent  with  time.  Skin,  teeth,  muscles,  and  eyes  start  exhibiting  the  features  of  an  emaciated  individual. Insomnia  is  usual  and  an  accidental  or  deliberate  overdose  causes  death.  Incidences  of  stroke  and  myocardial  ischemia  are  reported  to  be  high  in amphetamine addicts.

Facial  skin  with  weight  loss gives them a gaunt, hollowed-out appearance (Figure 2).

**Meth  Mouth.** Oral  cavity  findings  are  caused  by  several factors:  tooth  enamel  is  dissolved  by  the  harsh  irritant  nature  of the drug,  the blood  vessels contained in  healthy gums and  teeth shrink, increasing  the r ate of  tooth  decay, and  the production  of saliva diminishes (Figure 2).

**Psychosis.** Psychotic episodes  are seen  in MA  addicts that have  been  observed  with  short-term  use  as  well  as  in  chronic heavy  MA  users.2  Neurotoxic  damage  to  the  serotonergic  and 

dopaminergic  neurons  has  been  proposed2,4  for  psychosis 

resembling  schizophrenia.  The  latter  group  has  also  been 

implicated to  be addiction  prone in  several studies.  Chronic use 

is  very  commonly  associated  with  paranoid  features  that  are  a 

sign  of  what  is  referred  to  be  the  “rock  bottom”  of  the 

downstream spiral of MA abuse.

**End Organ  Damage and  Death.** Stroke, hear t attack,  and 

accelerated hypertensive states necessitates hospitalization, and 

death from overdose is common in MA and APA abusers.

drugs that  act by  doctrine of  false neurotransmitters  in the  CNS 

synapses (Figure 1A), is  their  ability  to  hit  the  tachyphylaxis 

benchmark  in  a  short  period  of  time.  Drugs  like  amphetamine, 

ephedrine, and their derivatives belong to the tachyphylaxis

exhibiting  class  of  drugs.1  Initial  stoichiometric  displacement  of the biogenic  amines occurs  at the  synaptic vesicles (Figure 1A) followed  by  the  storage  of  the  amphetamine  within  the granules.  After  synaptic  replacement,  the  next  nerve  impulse releases the  amphetamine i nstead of  the native  biogenic amine 

(dopamine,  adrenaline,  noradrenaline),  resulting  in  a  partial agonistic  effect  on  postsynaptic  receptor.  Eventually,  the 

disturbed  physiological  functions  of  these  biogenic  amines gets  the  abusers  into  a  mayhem,  resulting  in  severe  behavioral and  cognitive  abnormalities  that  become  clinically  evident  in MA  addicts.  The  synaptic  cross  talk  in  the  human  brain  is  a complex  phenomenon,  as  many  of  the  human  behavioral, 

cognitive,  and  motor  functions  are  not  the  result  of  the  function 

of  a  signal  neurotransmitter,  but  are  due  to  a  balance  between them  and  several  parallel  neurotransmitters  functioning  in concert.  A  reduced  functional  performance  of  one  of  the neurotransmitters  is  reflected  clinically  as  a  syndrome  because 

of  the  shifting  of  the  neurochemical  balance  toward  a functionally  opposite  neurotransmitter.  Parkinsonism  is  one known  example  of  such  a  neurotransmitter  imbalance  between

Understanding  the  concept  of  this  neuro­ transmitter  interplay  is  expected  to  improve  the  treatment protocols  in  the  rehabilitation  centers  that  are  striving  to understand  the  biological  basis  of  amphetamine  addiction.

**logues.** A  2017  world  drug  abuse  report  has  shown  that  the users of  amphetamines has  increased, reaching  the figure  of 37 million  globally.  Studies  of  drug  addiction  and  abuse  in  the United  States  indicate  that  MA  addiction  is  a  substantial  public health concern  that is  growing at  an alarming  rate. According  to the  National  Household  Survey  on  Drug  Abuse  done  in  2012, approximately  1.2  million  people  reported  use  of  MA  in  2011. APA  and  MA  are  now  thought  to  be  more  of  concern  than  any 

drug-related  deaths  in  Australia.  There  remains  no  standard 

treatment  of  MA  addiction.  In-house  managements  often  fail 

due  to  reduced  patient  compliance.  Management  of  the 

syndromic  presentation (Table 1) includes  drug  therapy, 

psychotherapy  that  encourages  the  patients  to  hold  on  to  the 

motivation  that  had  brought  them  to  the  rehabilitation  center. 

MA  induced  psychosis,  depression,  excessive  sleeping  anxiety, 

and  several  related  symptoms  have  to  be  treated  at  the  same 

time. No single drug has  been effective in combating these signs 

and symptoms  when used  alone. The  drugs used  to combat  the 

withdrawal  symptoms  have  proven  to  be  of  help,  but  despite 

some  of  them  having  an  influence  on  craving,  none  of  the 

treatment  regimens  has  remained  effective  on  abstinence. 

Understanding  that  the  tachyphylaxis  has  no  easier  way  to  be 

combated  remains  a major problem  in the  treatment of patients 

with  MA  addiction.  Replenishment  of  the  neurotransmitters 

coupled  with  normalization  of  the  parallel  running  synaptic 

neurotransmitters  is  needed  at  the  molecular  level  before  any 

clinical  improvements  could  be  expected.  Antipsychotics  have 

been used,  and drugs  like olanzapine  and haloperidol  effectively 

improved  psychotic  symptoms  due  to  amphetamines  in  the 

short-term.5  A  drawback  of  using  antipsychotics  could  be  that 

such  drugs  have  a  tendency  to  block  the  dopamine  receptor 

type-2,  potentially  increasing  anhedonia  that  could,  in  turn, 

cause  a  greater  vulnerability  to  relapse  into  drug  abuse.2 

Olanzapine  has  such  action  on  the  dopamine  type  2  receptor, 

but  has  the  advantage  of  being  effective  because  it  combats 

anxiety  and  depression  that  may  be  correlated  with  its  impact 

on the serotonergic 5HT2A receptor.5

### **■ CONCLUSION**

The  experience  of  exposure  to  a  euphoric  addictive  drugs  like 

APA and its anal ogues is perceived as  casual and amusing. The 

highs  (euphoria)  caused by  these illicit  drugs have  the potential 

of getting  stored as  memory and  the subsequent  compulsion to 

re-experience  the  euphoria.  Naivety,  therefore  cannot  be  an 

excuse  for  the  first  use  of  any  euphoric  drug  in  general,  and 

MA/APA  in  particular,  users  should  know  that  the  cycle  of 

use—denial—reuse repeats  itself to  eventually convert  a casual 

user to a compulsive addict. The management of MA addiction

and  MA  addiction  are  irreversible  cognitive  dysfunction  and psychosis  caused  by  neurotoxicity  that  results  in  permanent neuronal loss.3
