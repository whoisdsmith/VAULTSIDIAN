# Blueprints To A Better Future

---

- **Always** **Communicate**
  - Understand yourself and learn to understand how your significant other Communicates.
  - Without Communication there is no Relationship. Period.
- **Always Be Honest.**
  - If you do or say something bad, own that shit and apologize.
  - Pride and being stubborn has no place when it comes to making mistakes. That's the devils work and fuck that guy.
  - When you lie your relationship will bleed and so will the person you lied to.
- **Understand YOUR Needs and the things YOU value.**
  - It's just important to understand THEIR needs and what they value as well.
- **Every Relationship is different because every single person is different.**
  - What happened in your previous relationships have no place in your current one.
  - Just because you were lied to, cheated on or neglected before doesn't mean the same thing will happen with this new person. If you go into a new relationship with that mindset, you are metaphorically holding a gun to the head of this new person and have condemned the relationship to fail right from the beginning.
  - Every person has baggage and wounds from someone else, it is your responsibility to be open and understanding to why people feel the way they feel and to talk about it in ways that helps your relationship.
  - When people have been hurt, they don't always like to talk about it. Opening up is hard and even harder when it's to someone new and someone you have feelings for. This might be because they don't want to feel embarrassed or stupid or judged or vulnerable.
  - Be patient and be understanding.
- **Take the time to heal from your heartbreaks**
  - This really should be Number 1 on this subject because people don't understand that you can't just jump into a new relationship right after your previous one fails.
  - You have to heal your wounds. You have to understand why the relationship ended. You have to feel that pain and those aches in your stomach to the full extent.
  - **DO NOT** run from that pain. Face it and find acceptance and closure before moving on.
