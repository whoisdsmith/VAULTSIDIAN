# What's It Like To Be In Love?

---

I'm sure everyone will have something different to say about this and that's ok.

 "To be in love, is to be alive"

I don't know who originally said that but it's pretty close to the truth.

All the excitement, the butterflies, the never ending day dreaming of fairytales and perfect endings.

We go through many stages of love throughout life. Starting with the relationships we have when we're young. Love is a new feeling to us and we think we know everything about it. As we grow older, we realize just how ignorant our younger selves are. We knew nothing about intamacy or how to really treat each other.

Love is, going to and through hell with each other and for each other  
Sometimes, it's going to hell all by yourself to retrieve things the other cannot. Sometimes it's to fight demons that aren't yours. Sometimes that's where you end up after love has come and gone.

Too many times, we take for granted the good days. We tend to hold onto the bad days and turn them into resentment. Too often, we move at the speed of light and rarely stop to embrace the moment. We should stop more often to appreciate the way someone loves us, the way that they make us feel.

Love comes and love goes, but the feelings always stay.

Always.
