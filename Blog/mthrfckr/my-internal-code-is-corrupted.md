# My Internal Code Is Corrupted

---

I've known for awhile now that something wasn't right.

The sounds of alarms were going off and error codes were being thrown but I chose to ignore them because they weren't affecting me enough to the point where I couldn't keep going.

Turns out, it's the small things that end up crippling you the most.

Especially when they go unaddressed.

Those internal debugging features were installed to make sure the user runs and performs as smoothly as possible.

If there is an alarm or an error being thrown. **IT'S FOR A REASON!**

I knew that just as much back then as I do now.

That's what I do though. I ignore anything and everything unless it stops me right where I'm at and I'm left with the only option to deal with it right then and there.

It worked for 37 years. I knew those faults and error codes would never fix themselves but I thought that I would get to a point in my life where I would care enough about myself to take care of myself.

I know now , that if I had taken the time to install bug patches and updates, that would have prevented me from continuing to run on a corrupted operating system.  

There is no reset button, I can't just wipe my internal operating system or clear my cache. We are not the same as computers. Computers will eventuality crash hard enough that they won't run at all until you replace hardware or install a new OS.

Humans will continue to run even when they're completely faulty and corrupted. Our brain just re-wires itself to keep operating even after the code it spits out is improperly encoded.

Maybe there's someone out there who might still see some light and hope somewhere in that statement.

But I don't. If I can't fix my internal code that was written for me and only me, than nobody else can either.

I am in an endless loop that I can't get out of.

Every day it uses more and more CPU, RAM and storage space.  

Please take the time to address the small issues before it's too late.
