Wednesday morning I had a dream so real, so haunting I woke up and with instant sadness and anxiety. I instantly drank two beers and sat with all of my ghosts. I then did the only thing I knew how to keep them at bay……

I relapsed into a brick of Xanax and 4 flexurals. Some ghosts will always find you, you will never be able to bury all of your past. My mind is weak, my heart seeks peace. I need my son, he’s the only one who makes me feel truly alive. God, if you’re listening and if you’re real. My ears are open, are yours?

I use to think things couldn’t get worse than losing your first pet. I use to think there was nothing worse than being humiliated in front of the whole school back in 4th grade. I use to think there was nothing worse than having a face full of pimples. I use to think there was nothing worse than my first gf breaking up because I wasn’t cool enough. I use to think there was nothing worse than having to shower  with everyone else after gym class. I use to think there was nothing worse than my gf breaking up with me to sleep with some douche bag who didn’t care about her. I use to think there was nothing worse than hearing the words “im pregnant” while being in the recording studio finishing up final touches for our first record deal. I use to think there was nothing worse than being on tour with two of my best friends, when my fiancé was having complications with my son. I use to think there was nothing worse than working 90 hr weeks and coming home to someone who always complained about me not being around. I use to think there was nothing worse than my fiancé sleeping with someone who was supposed to be a friend. I use to think it couldn’t get worse that that. Truth is it can always get worse but hearing the person you have loved so much and for so long tell you that she’s pregnant and marrying another man and on top of that taking our son with her as they start a new family, well I don’t know if there is anything worse than that but I do know it’s been 4 years and Nothings come close to touching those feelings. I am being such a bitch right now, I’ll blame lack of sleep and alcohol for this one.
