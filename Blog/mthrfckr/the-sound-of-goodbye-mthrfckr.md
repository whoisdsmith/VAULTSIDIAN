# The Sound of Goodbye–MTHRFCKR

---

## [Uncategorized](https://whoisdsmith.ctrlaltback.space/category/uncategorized/) · August 9, 2011

I was living in the hopes that you would stay  
I never knew you were dying just to get away  
I spent those last few months staying up at night  
You spent those months practicing the sound of goodbye

Which meant

No more i Iove yous, no more goodnights  
No more “how was your day” and “are you alright?”  
No more fighting, no more lying, no more reasons to continue trying  
cause whats the point when everything you love is gone  
some will fall apart while others fall back in love

This day was meant for us  
I never thought that we would give up  
If I could do things over  
I’d find a way to save our love  
I learned that time heals the pain,  
but time can’t erase those old feelings  
And when I see your face,  
my heart weakens and I can’t breathe  
Straight to my stomach it drops  
once again Im starting to get lost  
In that place where we still exist  
As two lovers who wanted kids

But Then  
Reality sets in, my mind is caving in  
and Im confused again, I break before I bend.  
Will I ever end this fiction in my head?  
I need to try and live a life that you’re not in.

(Wake me up from this state im in  
my head is such a mess)  
(Cant I just forget the nights we spent  
we were never meant)  
(Its hard to accept that this is it  
and im still living in)  
(Regrets of what went wrong  
with a past I cant out run)

Wake up, just wake me up
