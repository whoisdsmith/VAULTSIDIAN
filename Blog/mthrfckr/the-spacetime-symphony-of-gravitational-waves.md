# Official Video For Upcoming Astronaudia Release

Back in 2020 I watched a TED Talk by Kelly Holley-Bockelmann called “The Spacetime Symphony of Gravitational Waves”

It inspired me to write an album about it (I guess it’s more of a soundtrack really) anyways, this was the first song I wrote.

I named it after her TED Talk.
