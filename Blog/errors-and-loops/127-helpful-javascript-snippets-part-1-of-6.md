JavaScript is one of the most popular languages you can learn. As many people say: “If you’re going to learn just one programming language, go for JavaScript.”

Quincy Larson, the founder of FreeCodeCamp, was asked in a recent [interview](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/short-interview-with-quincy-larson/) which language developers should learn first. He answered: “JavaScript.”:

> “Software is eating the world, and JavaScript is eating software. JavaScript is becoming more dominant with each year, and nobody knows what might eventually replace it.
>
> If you don’t have a very good reason to learn a new language (such as your job requiring you to maintain a non-JavaScript codebase), my humble advice is to focus on getting better at JavaScript.”

If this sounds compelling to you, here’s a list of 127 beneficial snippets taken from [this project](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-code) that you can learn and use immediately.

# 1\. All

This snippet returns `true` if the predicate function returns `true` for all elements in a collection and `false` otherwise. You can omit the second argument `fn`_ *if you want to use `Boolean`* _as a default value.

# 2\. allEqual

This snippet checks whether all elements of the array are equal.

# 3\. approximatelyEqual

This snippet checks whether two numbers are approximately equal to each other, with a small difference.

# 4\. arrayToCSV

This snippet converts the elements that don’t have commas or double quotes to strings with comma-separated values.

# 5\. arrayToHtmlList

This snippet converts the elements of an array into `<li>` tags and appends them to the list of the given ID.

# 6\. Attempt

This snippet executes a function, returning either the result or the caught error object.

# 7\. Average

This snippet returns the average of two or more numerical values.

# 8\. averageBy

This snippet returns the average of an array after initially doing the mapping of each element to a value using a given function.

# 9\. Bifurcate

This snippet splits values into two groups and then puts a truthy element of `filter`_ _in the first group, and in the second group otherwise.

You can use `Array.prototype.reduce()`_ *and `Array.prototype.push()`* _to add elements to groups based on `filter`.

# 10\. bifurcateBy

This snippet splits values into two groups, based on a predicate function. If the predicate function returns a truthy value, the element will be placed in the first group. Otherwise, it will be placed in the second group.

You can use `Array.prototype.reduce()`_ *and `Array.prototype.push()`* *to add elements to groups, based on the value returned by `fn`* _for each element.

# 11\. bottomVisible

This snippet checks whether the bottom of a page is visible.

# 12\. byteSize

This snippet returns the length of a string in bytes.

# 13\. Capitalize

This snippet capitalizes the first letter of a string.

# 14\. capitalizeEveryWord

This snippet capitalizes the first letter of every word in a given string.

# 15\. castArray

This snippet converts a non-array value into array.

# 16\. Compact

This snippet removes false values from an array.

# 17\. countOccurrences

This snippet counts the occurrences of a value in an array.

# 18\. Create Directory

This snippet uses `existsSync()` to check whether a directory exists and then `mkdirSync()` to create it if it doesn’t.

# 19\. currentURL

This snippet returns the current URL.

# 20\. dayOfYear

This snippet gets the day of the year from a `Date`_ _object.

# 21\. Decapitalize

This snippet turns the first letter of a string into lowercase.

This is part one of these short snippets. There are five other parts remaining that you can read.
