# Humble

I am super humble and thankful that I have chosen **not** to let myself down.

I've got a big heart.

I've got a light inside me that glows, no matter how dark it gets.

I've always wanted to be where I'm at right now, continuing to shine even when the darkness starts casting its shadows.
