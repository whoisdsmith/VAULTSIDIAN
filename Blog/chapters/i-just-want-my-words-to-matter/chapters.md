# Chapters

I use to write chapter after chapter about you.

The good,the bad and the ugly.

For months I lost countless nights of sleep,

writing you pages and pages of how I felt.

I remember I would always hit the send button as if you were my editor, who would revise it and provide feedback.

Those were thousands of words you never read and oh how it burns to not be heard.
