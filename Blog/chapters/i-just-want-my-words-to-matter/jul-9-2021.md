Eight years ago, back in the Summer of 2013, I found an app called “Day One ” It was and still is labeled as a “Journaling App” but it really is so much more\.  From time to time I go through these phases of wanting to write my thoughts down, privately just me and my thoughts\. What I’m feeling, how I’m feeling, where I’m at in life, who Im with, what I love, what I hate and so on\. So I thought I would give this app a shot and write down a few words here and there and I would grow out of it and discard it as time went by\. Here’s the thing, I never got tired or bored with it, I actually started using it more and more each year\. Looking back now, I have come to understand and realize this isn’t just a journal, this is my journey through life as an adult, more so, every entry is a blueprint from where I was to where Im at now\.

So many of the earlier entries are filled with frustration, confusion, sadness, bitterness and negativity\. So many entries, that looking back now I realize,  just how selfish and naive I was being sometimes\. Moments back in time where I swore I was right or that my opinion was the only one that mattered\. I am so glad that regardless of how or what I was feeling in those moments, I decided to take the time to write them down, because now I am able to go back and see things from a different perspective and change the things that I was once unwilling to before\. The thing about making mistakes is we don’t like to acknowledge them or admit to them, we like to pretend they never happened and bury them deep enough that we forget about them, or we like to put the blame on other people, usually the ones that love us the most\. Sometimes it really feels like we would rather put that weight and that blame on other people and know that it will impact them in heavy ways, than to actually admit we are at fault and take responsibility for actions\. I understand now just how deep those scars can go and where that road can take you, when you carry the blame and the burden of someone else’s mistakes and when you put that blame and burden onto others as well\. I have tried to document any and all of my mistakes and I haven’t deleted a single one, instead I go back and place tags on those entries on whether or not I have taken responsibility for them or whether I have learned from them\.

I started with a single Journal and now Im up to 39, as I mentioned earlier, this isn’t just a journal to write what you’re feeling or going through, there are so many things that can be integrated with it as well, using IFTTT, iOS Shortcuts, Facebook, Instagram, it can track your entire location each day and automatically create an entry of where you were and what you were doing,  you can upload photos, videos, documents, create voice entries and even send text messages to different journals to create a new entry\. Most of my journals are automated by certain criteria\.

I have always wanted to do better and be better and I feel like I’m a lot better than I use to be but I know I’m not even close to where I want to be\.

It’s never too late to change or to do better\.

That is all\.
