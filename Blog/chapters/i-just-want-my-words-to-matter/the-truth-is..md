# The Truth Is

You never really heal from certain traumas. They become a part of you forever. The only hope is that you don’t become the people that hurt you. It’s not fair that they did what they did to you, but it’s more unfair that you cause someone else the same trauma just because it was done to you. Know the difference, break the cycle or the cycle keeps repeating. Year after year, generation to generation.
