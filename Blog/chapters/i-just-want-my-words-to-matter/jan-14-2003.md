What if this world was all fake? What if nothing mattered anymore? What if God doesn’t exist? What if, what you thought was fake was real? What if who you thought you were, wasnt really you at all? These are all questions I ask myself daily and many more I don’t understand\. Why am I here? What is my purpose for being here\. Do you ever wonder where it is you go after you die? Maybe you turn into something else or someone else, maybe you go to heaven or hell, or…worse maybe nothing at all\. Maybe our lives are just for the moment\. 

Maybe when were alive that’s the only time we get to live\. Maybe were all just made up of someone else’s imagination\. It doesn’t matter anyway\. No one cares about some stupid kid whos got nothing, who took the wrong road and shot up on heroin, no one cares that I tried to do the right thing, no one cares about me, nor does anyone care about anyone else all we care about is ourselves, about money about power, about all the stupid shit that’s corrupted this world\. Again I ask myself is this even real? Am I really sitting here talking to myself?

The story begins back in the fall of 1997 when I was 17\. I was living with my parents of course before everything fell apart\. I was working for a construction company and was a senior in high school, everything seemed right I had a beautiful girlfriend Sara she’s been my girl since 8th grade, my first love ever\. I had the best friends ever too everything was so perfect…

I was going to go to college, get married, get a decent job, and start a family of my own, when it all fell apart\. I remember it happened on a cold dark night in October\. I was at my friend Greg’s house watching a skate video when I got the phone call from my grandma\. My parents had gone out for the evening and on their way home a semi driver fell asleep at the wheel and smashed head on with my mom and dad, my mother wasn’t wearing her seatbelt that night which was weird because she never leaves anywhere without it on\. But she was thrown through the windshield and killed instantly, my dad on the other hand passed out he was trapped between the dash and the motor\. When the semi struck them it hit so hard it pushed the motor right into him, and then came the fire that killed him\. Both my parents died that night\. I remember watching the news and seeing what was left of my parent’s vehicle and watching in horror as the policemen carried away the black body suits\. Was this fucking real? Were my parents really dead? That wasn’t the part that hurt the most, before they left that evening my mother and I had gotten in a big fight because I wouldn’t clean the house and mow the lawn she yelled and said I was worthless and a mistake so I replied that I wish she was dead\. Oh god how I regret that\. Ill never be able to forgive myself for saying that\.



Well as time went by I dropped out of school and lost my job I was going nowhere, still in shock the days grew darker I had nowhere left to go\. Sara decided to call it quits, after 4 years she leaves me, the one thing I had left\. She moved away and went to a college in California\. I thought to myself that life couldn’t get much worse, but this was just the beginning\. After Sara moved off to college I hitched a ride to Boston\. I decided that maybe I could start a new life there\. I stayed in a shelter in the evening, and during the days I spent hours walking up and down the street looking for jobs after a few days I got one working for a used CD store making $6\.30 an hour\. Which wasn’t bad I guess it was better than nothing\. After 2 months I saved up on enough to rent an apartment in the suburbs\. Things seemed to start showing hope again I met new people, made new friends and even met Jennifer the prettiest girl I’ve seen since Sara she’s the only girl I had spoken to since Sara\. After awhile of talking we began dating and fell in love a few months later I moved in with her\. I moved up from $6\.30 to $10\.50 at the CD store I was the new manager, which wasn’t bad because I loved music\. Most of my past had faded away\. Except the last words I said to my mother, they still haunt me I try to shut them out but I never can\. A year went by and Jennifer was pregnant I was going to be a dad something that scared me since I was only 19\. Maybe this is what I needed though, a chance to be somebody better than I am a lot better\. I wanted to be a good dad, but as fate has it, It happened again only this time on a Grey morning\. I was walking on my way to work and Jennifer was on her way to the grocery store when a taxi driver ran a red light and struck her throwing her over the car\. I turned around in horror as I heard her scream it was a short scream to\. I ran as fast as I could punching and pushing my way through the crowds of people surrounding her\. Ill never forget the look on her face or the last words from her mouth\. She said, “I’m sorry Kris ill always love you don’t cry everything will be alright” I was so furious at the world I hated it I hated that cab driver I hated God I hated myself\. Everything good I ever had has been taken from me\.


After her funeral I lost it, I couldn’t control my feelings any longer all I could feel was solemn and nostalgia\. I hated myself and everyone else to\. I had nothing now\. Am I cursed? Is this all just a dream? Or am I just as fucked up as I think I am? Well whatever the answer was it didn’t matter\. Nothing would ever be the same\. I tried sleeping at nights, I tried to eat and think\. I just tried to move on but I couldn’t I was constantly reminded that everything ive ever loved has been taken from me\. Days turned to nights, nights turned to weeks and weeks turned to months and nothing got better\. I was in search of something anything to make me feel better cause all that’s in side me now is pain and sorrow\. Some times id rent my favorite movies and make it seem like old times but it never worked I never got through the whole movie with out breaking down and destroying the living room\. Six months went by and still nothing changed I never slept and when I did it was because I past out from exhaustion and when that happened it was always nightmares\. Eventually I took my problems to the street, I thought for sure drugs would make me feel better, and they did\. They were the solution to all of my problems\. I started off just smoking a couple of joints here and there, but that didn’t seem to help much, because I would just smoke eat sleep, smoke eat sleep, and every time I slept it was like déjà vu all over again\. The memories would play over in my head all day and they’d never escape me even when I slept\. I had no one to comfort me no one cared at all\. Then one day I went for a walk and that’s when I met Jay he was walking down the street and I wasn’t paying attention of course, and I ran right into him\. He was a big muscular guy who I thought was going to beat the shit out of me, but instead he turned around and said, “are you alright?” and I was like yea im ok\. 

He turned around and took about two steps and turned around again and said do you need a job? I did need a job I had spent all my money on weed, so I said sure and we walked to his place\. His crib was awesome he had everything\. We started talking and he asked me if ive ever dealt before and I said no so he took me through this little tutorial about how to deal and make drugs\. This guy was out of his fucking mind\. He’s known me for like two hours and he’s trusting me with his money and drugs\. He showed me how to make and mix up certain drugs, and that’s when I got really messed up\. I started taking some crazy pills that made me feel really really good\. After  that I got into heroin I shot up at least once a day maybe more\. It made me forget my past and myself\. I was making some good money and dealing some heavy drugs to pretty big people\. I moved up from the suburbs and into a classy apartment\. Jay and I became partners dealing to people from all over\. It was big, We were big I lost track of time and myself, over a year had gone by since Jennifer died, and almost 3 since my parents\. I still missed them, but the drugs wouldn’t let me miss them too much\. I went out one night making a delivery for Jay to drop off a really big package when I was greeted by 6 other guys who apparently wanted the same package, I wasn’t going to just hand it over either, they threatened to kill me if I didn’t but I wasn’t scared and especially of dying\. I told them this was an important package that’s going to an important person but they didn’t listen they jumped me before I even realized what was going on they took the package but they didn’t get away free I got in a few good packages before I was knocked out\. The only thing I remember after that was driving to Jays to tell him what happened but he didn’t care\. Little did I know there was over 20 lbs of cocaine in that package\. 

Jay told me if I didn’t get it back that it was my ass\. This wasn’t my fault I was doing my job and shit happens there wasn’t anything I could do about it, and there was no way in heel I could get that cocaine back either\. A week went by and Jay showed up at my door demanding the coke or the money\. I didn’t have either\. So he gave me one more day and if I didn’t have it I was dead meat\. Why does all this shit always happen to me? What did I do? if there is a god what did I do to him? What if there is no heaven or hell, do I only have one more day left to live? 

So I said fuck it\. I had $20,000 saved up and I was leaving from this fucked up place\. I realized this wasn’t what I wanted anymore, but it was too late…I packed up my shit and threw everything in my car, when I heard a familiar voice\. Where ya going? It was Jay and some friends I never met\. I replied that I was leaving this town and if he was going to kill me to go ahead but he didn’t he and his boys just beat the shit out of me\. I was stabbed in the right kidney and my left knee had been shattered\. He took everything from me my wallet with the last picture of my mom and dad and Jennifer, all of my money and clothes and my car\. Again I had nothing\. I was left for dead on the side of the street 100 people live on this big street and yet no one saw anything? No one was willing to help me? No one even called an ambulance\. I crawled in the middle of the road hoping that would stop somebody but everyone just went around me\. What the fuck is wrong with all these people? After almost 3 hours a cop rolled by and radioed in an ambulance\. I went into shock and fell into a deep sleep\.





My right kidney had to be immediately taken out and my left knee was shattered the doctors said id never be able to walk right again\. My nose was broken and my lip had to have 3 stitches\. I was fucked up pretty bad\. It took me 6 months to fully recover and guess what I walked just fine\. I heard from some people that later that month jay got killed in a shoot out so that was pretty cool I guess…after I got out of rehab I had no where to go, no money, and no one to turn to I was so sick of this I tried to build up the bricks over and over again but they always got knocked down\. I ask myself whats the point? Why am I here? I decided it wasn’t my destiny to always live in the past\. I was going to forget everything change myself change who I was and who I am\. Ill never be Kris Conley again\.
I slept on a park bench that night, I saw Jennifer in my dream and she told me that everything is all right and that it’ll all work out in the end\. So next morning I hitched a ride to Florida with hopes of starting over, with hopes to be somebody new, with hopes of forgetting Kris Conley\. I got a job working on the docks where I cut up fish for 8 hrs a day I had to sleep in someone’s boat for about a month before I could rent my own place\.


I finally was starting to piece back my life I wasn’t much of a talker I didn’t have many friends in fact I didn’t any I wasn’t anti\-social I did associate with people but I never was friends with them I knew better\. I had moved on from my past yes but I still wasn’t taking any chances…
I went around each day after work looking for a better job, but no one wanted to hire me since I had no diploma and my work record sucked\. Eventually I found a job at a computer shop I had a lot of experience with computers since all I did in rehab was use one of the nurses lap tops I had learned how to design web pages and make programs so that’s what I did\. I also got my GED and after that I went to a community college in business and production which was ironic because 4 years ago I hated that shit\. One night after class I took the long way home I was starting to feel better I was making something of myself I cant even explain how much pain and hatred I’ve had in me\. I went through Cavanaugh park which was cool because it wasn’t your normal park it was a musicians park where many great bands have played \(the clash, the ramones, something corporate etc\.\) as I was daydreaming I passed a bunch of bullies beating on a another kid, they were seriously hurting him and I watched and just kept going I kept on walking, just hept on walking, and kept walking…when it hit me BOOM\!\!\! 

What was I doing? How could I just walk away from that? Ive been there just like that kid in his spot and when I was there everyone just walked away so I wasn’t going to do the same\. I turned around and thought to myself what good am I going to do there’s 6 of them and 1 of me but that didn’t scare me I was doing a good thing I hoped\. I yelled at the group to stop but they didn’t so I ran over to them and pushed them off the kid they stared at me like I was the stupidest person theyd ever seen\. “Hey what the hell you doing bitch get outta here or youll end up just like him” one of them yelled\. I replied with shut the hell up and outta know where one the kids kicked the kid right in the face and I snapped I mean I just blew up with anger, and I went after the guy who had kicked the other kid in face\. I just started punching his face in until all the other guys pulled me off\. I had beaten that guy up so bad that they all were scared shitless of me and picked their friend up and left\. My whole body was covered in blood\. I just sat on the ground in shock I had never been that aggressive and angry it even scared me\. Billy the kid who was getting beat up came over to me and sat down\. He thanked me and told me that the guy I beat the shit out of slept with his girlfriend and Billy had threatened to kick his ass and instead the guy got all his friends and beat the shit out of him\. Talk about bad karma, something I myself had a lot of I guess\.


Billy had been my only friend in Florida\. He was a cool guy we played Tony
Hawk 4 on PS2 every weekend and watched Jay and silent Bob movies to get out all the laughs\. Yea those were the good times I thought they’d never end, but as time went by Billy got married to a beautiful model and moved to Paris\. The last day I saw him he told me that I was going to find my own lady and that ill live happily ever after I just laughed and congratulated him\. That night I was watching CNN to get the weather forecast when a plane had crashed in the ocean flight 97 that was Billy’s flight\. I just sat in despair what the hell was going on I swear that I should lock myself in a steamer trunk\. So here I am now 21 years old and still wondering why I’m here\. I believe that there is a God out there and I believe that he thinks he’s a good man but I cant bring myself to forgive him id rather sell my sole to the devil and live in hell for all eternity……
