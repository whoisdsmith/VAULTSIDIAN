# Analogy

Drawing you a picture of how you make me feel, using words in the form of an analogy

It starts with a top view of an ledge of a cliff.

Standing on top of that cliff is you

That ledge represents your breaking point, your life, your feelings, your mental state and everything else weighing you down.

Next we see that ledge break and take you with it

But you don’t fall the whole way down, you catch yourself on another ledge but a ledge that leaves you stuck where you’re at, with no way to climb in any direction.

So you cry out for help, scared, anxious, sad and alone

I hear those cries and I already know where you’re at and what’s happened, so I bring food, water, flashlights and rope

I arrive on top of the place you have just fallen from and I assure you everything is going to be fine and to remain calm

I get out my rope and I toss it down to you, but you’re further down than I had thought, so the rope doesn’t reach.

Right now, there’s no way to get you back up, without me having to climb down far enough to where that rope will finally reach you.

So I make my descent down to the halfway point by climbing, but as I get there, the ledge above me breaks so I can’t climb back up

So I throw the rope to you

And yea being on that ledge is scary as hell, and the way back up to safe ground looks so impossible to get to even with the rope and my help. And it involves a lot of trust in each other that we’re both going to get each other back up there, and we begin to struggle and doubt because the other one is falling behind and can’t pull their own weight, so the other has to sometimes pull both of us. When Tyler shows up as the helicopter, it’s an easy option, a safer one, the quickest way off that ledge for sure. But you can’t see past getting off that ledge, you don’t stop to think about where he plans on taking you once you get in the passenger seat. You don’t see that you made me into your collateral damage in that moment and that you left me for dead, until it’s too late
