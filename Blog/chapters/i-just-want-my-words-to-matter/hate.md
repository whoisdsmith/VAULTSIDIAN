# Hate

I don't know where to start honestly. 

- I hate where I'm at in life right now. 
- I hate who I am. 
- I hate the decisions I make. 
- I hate the shit I do. 
- I fucking hate everything. 
- I hate feeling like this. 

I want to change but I don't know how. 

- I have no motivation for anything. 
- Everything in my life seems pointless. 
- I feel like nothing I do will ever make a difference.
-  I feel like none of this will even matter.
