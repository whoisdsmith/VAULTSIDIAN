# Midnight Thoughts

There was a time not too long ago, that I had lost all hope, all ambition and all of myself. I was a victim to my own self defeat and in that I grew comfortable. I was ok with my life going nowhere for a long time. My views on myself and the world around me grew so dark, so negative that I dimmed all the light that was actually surrounding me. Some people stay in that place their whole lives but one day I started trying again, trying to live, trying to find a job I would actually like working at and through that little bit of effort at the beginning, I found myself with a surprising amount of opportunities. There were no hand outs, I made no excuses for myself, I just wanted more from my life than I had settled for, I wanted the things I felt deeply that I truly deserved.
