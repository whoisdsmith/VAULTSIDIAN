Wednesday morning I had a dream so real, so haunting I woke up and with instant sadness and anxiety. I instantly drank two beers and sat with all of my ghosts. I then did the only thing I knew how to keep them at bay……

I relapsed into a brick of Xanax and 4 flexurals. Some ghosts will always find you, you will never be able to bury all of your past. My mind is weak, my heart seeks peace. I need my son, he’s the only one who makes me feel truly alive. God, if you’re listening and if you’re real. My ears are open, are yours?
