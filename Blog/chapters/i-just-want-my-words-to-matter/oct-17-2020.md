# Things for You to Read When I'm Dead and Gone

It's so hard not to be angry with you\. It's so hard to do anything without you\. You hurt me so much and you don't even care that you did it on purpose and what have I done to you these last 2 years when we've been together? Nothing\! All my mistakes came from years ago and all I did was my best to not repeat them and I didn't\! I never would have\! I really hope you're miserable with Tyler and that he makes you into a raging alcoholic until you drown in it enough to finally realize what you did to me and maybe one day you'll FINALLY be sorry for all of it, because you aren't nor have you ever been sorry or you wouldn't have done this shit over and over just because I am fucking struggling to get on my feet\. Word of advice don't ever get married unless it's to Tyler and you both can die together miserably\.

Forever unlove

Your Ex\-husband
