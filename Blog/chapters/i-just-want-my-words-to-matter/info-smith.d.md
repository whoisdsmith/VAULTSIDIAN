Once I hit that Enter key, I woke up with the ability to choose more than just the default outcome, I still make mistakes and I still make the wrong choices but instead of repeating them over and over the way I was programmed to, I continuously update those lines of code to have greater odds at making better decisions and with better decisions come a better ending.
