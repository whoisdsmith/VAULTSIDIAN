# Success

My Definition of success.

This is what my stock has looked like over the last 4 years. I know 2020 has been hell for some but I had more gains in the last 12 months than I did the last 36 months combined. I stopped investing in myself when one my biggest investors cashed out and I really thought I was going to go under at this point in time last year but It didn’t happen. Why? Because when you’re at the bottom, you really don’t have anything left to lose. So if the worse thing that could happen, has already happened, there’s nothing left to be afraid of. I started to see myself as who I wanted to be, instead of the person that was always doubting me. It’s kind of funny looking back now at the person who cashed out on me cause they thought their next investment was going to bring them better opportunities that had far greater payouts. Turns out they invested in a fraudulent broker who just wanted their investment for personal gain with no intentions of ever doing anything they said they would idea of the perfect life that never even existed and you bought into it and in a more profitable and reinvent yourselffrom (literally) the bottom up and now I can finally participate in that song where Drake says “started at the bottom, now we here”
