# dad

My favorite part of my dads chapter, wasn’t just that he was my dad, it was the part where he didn’t have to be and chose to be. My biological father pretty much left me and my mom on our own and up until I was 5 years old I knew there was something missing in my life and than this man showed up with his contagious smile wearing his invisible cape and took me in as his son

My ex wife use to tell me that I must’ve been sheltered as a child or that I must be completely ignorant or blind to the fact that the way I see life and the way I see the world is not the same way everyone else sees it.

Growing up I had a wonderful childhood, my dad always gave me 100 percent day in and day out, even on the days I was a full on hellion and giving him and my mom hell, he continued to love me through all of it. In fact, it seemed the more I acted out, the harder he loved me, until there came a time when I was 9 or 10 that I realized this man wasn’t going to ever leave me and he wasn’t going anywhere without me by his side.

He taught me how to throw and catch my first ball,  
how to ride a bike,  
how to swim,  
how to fish,  
how to hunt  
to treat others with kindness and respect  
to stand up for the things that I believe in  
to always fight for the things I love  
To not give up on myself or the people I care about when things get difficult  
And also how to stand up and defend myself  
Should it ever be necessary

He always told me that fighting was never the answer and to never start fights with anyone. He also told me if I ever found myself in a situation where I was being bullied or in a position where the only option was to defend myself that I had his full permission to whoop their ass and that once it was over, to be the bigger person and help them back up and shake their hand out of respect.

That was my dad, always loving and living life to the fullest and just wanting the best for everyone.  

As I grew older and got into sports and later into music, he supported me every step of the way. Him and my mom were at every game and every show and I never had to try and find where my dad would be seated at cause he would just yell my name obnoxiously loud as he could and it’s those moments that I will never forget.

He was proud of me and supported me in everything I wanted to do, no matter how much I sucked in the beginning, he would push me to practice harder or play longer until I was confident in everything I was doing.

I never had to question, whether he loved me or cared about me, he always made it known. The fact that he wasn’t my biological father never made him second guess himself or the way he treated me. I was his son, his only son that he loved more than life. I knew it, he knew it and those are the principles that I began to build upon in my early adult life.

It didn’t matter how dark the world got, or how much I struggled on my bad days, I always saw hope, I saw light and I found peace in knowing that tomorrow would be a new day to start over again and keep building on the foundation my dad had helped me put in place.

I will admit that I was Naïve and ignorant for a long time when it came to how other people see the world and what principles they had used to build their life upon.

My childhood, my teenage years and the beginning of my young adulthood were pretty great. I know it’s because of the love and care my mom and dad both gave to me. It wasn’t until my mid 20s where I began to finally realize just how lucky and blessed I was to be able to grow up the way I did.

I came to realize in some pretty horrible ways that lots of people were not as fortunate to have a father and childhood as me. My ex wife was one of those people. She sees the world as dark, bitter and angry and I see the world just the opposite. She was my first real lesson in understanding how blessed and fortunate I am.

It wasn’t until I got divorced that I really started to think about where I would be if my dad had never crossed paths with my mom and if I would have ended viewing my life and the world around me in a much different way.

This man, my dad, brought the light into my life and he never let it go out no matter what struggles he was going through, he showed up every day and every night with no complaints and with a heart full of love

So if all the things he did for me really made me sheltered and ignorant for wanting to cast my light on to others, the same as he did for me. Than I’ll stay sheltered and I’ll stay ignorant but most of all I will stay forever thankful and grateful for what this man did for me.

He was my father, my friend and my hero, and I will miss him every day.
