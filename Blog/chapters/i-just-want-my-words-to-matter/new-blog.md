I use to think things couldn't get worse than losing your first pet. I use to think there was nothing worse than being humiliated in front of the whole school back in 4th grade. I use to think there was nothing worse than having a face full of pimples. I use to think there was nothing worse than my first gf breaking up because I wasn't cool enough. I use to think there was nothing worse than having to shower with everyone else after gym class. I use to think there was nothing worse than my gf breaking up with me to sleep with some douche bag who didn't care about her. I use to think there was nothing worse than hearing the words "im pregnant" while being in the recording studio finishing up final touches for our first record deal. I use to think there was nothing worse than being on tour with two of my best friends, when my fiancé was having complications with my son. I use to think there was nothing worse than working 90 hr weeks and coming home to someone who always complained about me not being around. I use to think there was nothing worse than my fiancé sleeping with someone who was supposed to be a friend. I use to think it couldn't get worse that that. Truth is it can always get worse but hearing the person you have loved so much and for so long tell you that she's pregnant and marrying another man and on top of that taking our son with her as they start a new family, well I don't know if there is anything worse than that but I do know it's been 4 years and Nothings come close to touching those feelings.

Well Lets Go Over Some Accomplishments.

I’m Down Over 40lb's Since The Beginning of April

I Have Been Able To Have My kids In A Much Better Environment.

I've Definetley Had Pienty Of Time To Learn About Myself & Focus On The Things I Want In Life

Ive Spent All But 2 Days Of The Last 60 Completely Clean & Sober!

I Have Not Let Myself Nor Wanted To Be With Another Woman.

My Pimping Days Were Over The First Night I Kissed My Wife For The First Time.

If She Could Hear Me Now Or See Me Now, I Think She Would Realize She Was Wrong About Me, Im Not Even Talking About Being Wrong For Leaving Me, But Being Wrong About Who I Am & Have Become.

I Learned A Lot From Her Insecurities & Her Belief That I Was Just A Guy Who Wanted Everyone But Her.

If That Were True True, It Would Be Her In My Shoes And Not The Other Way Around.

She Has One Hell Of An Ability To Just Forget About Me & Move On, Like I Never Even Existed.

I Do Miss The Good Parts Of Her, I Always Will.

Her Smile Would Dissentegrate Any Bad Feeling Away From Me. That Laugh & That Smile Together Would Light Up Every Room She Would Walk Into.

I Hope There Is That Old Soul Left Inside Of Her Its The Reason Why I Chose To Be With Her, She Meant Everything To Me & Tried My Best To Show Her That In The Only Ways I Knew How, But It Just Wasn't Enough I Tried To Change Into Somebody I Wasn't Sust To Make Her Happy But All I Did Was Lose Myself & Make Her Hate Me. Im So₂ Tered & Emotionally Drained Yoday, I Just Felt I Had To Write About This Because Its Important To Me Who I

Am Now, This Still Feels Like A Dream To Me Sometimes, I Guess Because I Never Once Pictured My Life Without Her Being In It

I Really Want To Write To Inspire, I Want To Be Known For Something Positive, Someone Who Was Able To Help Others Who Are Going Through Some Badshit.

For The Last Few Years Ive Been Consumed With So Much Negativity & During That Time I Was Unable To See Not Only The Good Things But The Effects I Had On People Around Me, Most Of All My Children.

I Wish I Had Gotten Myself Out Of That Situation Years Ago, But I Was So Convinced I Could Change The Situation Outcome.

Towards The End Of That Relationship I Was Changing, I Was Becoming A Better Man By Acknowledging My Flaws And My Mistakes, But Sometimes It’s Just Too Late To Save Something That Was Always Doomed From The Start.

Life Can Be So Hard Sometimes, Especialy When We Are The Ones Who Choose To Make Decisions That Can Come Back & Bite Us In The Ass.

## Fathers Day

Date: 06-18-2017

I Would Say My Current Mood Is Just Pure Sadness, I Spent 1,982 Days With A Woman I Thought Would Grow Old & Die With Me.

She Ended Up Moving On Long Before She Ended Our Marriage.

To Say That I Was Heart Broken Would Not Even Come Close To How I Feel. So many Emotions Pouring Out Of Me & Every One of Them Pulling Me In Different Directions.

I Was Crushed, I Was So Angry, I Was In Denial, I Was A Mess.

It's Been 59 Days Since She Kicked Me Out & Ended Our Marriage. I've Been Doing So Much Better Than I Was On Day One.

There Hasn't Been A Day Thus Far Where I Don't Think About Her, She Always Finds A Way To Creep Back Into My Thoughts, Even When What I'm Doing Has Nothing To Do With Her.

Today Shes Telling Another Man Happy Fathers Day & Shes Probably Doing All The Things For Him That She Did For Me. I’d Be Lying If I Said I Didn't Think About It, Or If It Didn't Bother Me.
