# Betrayer

It's a new year, and I bet you're hoping I move on and give up,

But why would I do that when i'm doing what I love?

Exposing you has become my favorite drug,
And I will not stop until this story is done.

I told you all I ever wanted was the truth,
But you had to keep lying cause that's all you ever do.

You're a sociopath who's out on the loose,
But don't worry baby, I turned your collar into a noose.

Cause after all the shit you put me through,
I figured it's the least I could do.

So do me a favor and just put it on
And swing above the trees where you belong
