# Gravedigger

Don't underestimate the person you tried to bury,  
Cause nothing but time exists down in that cemetery.

Gravedigger, you should not have married me.

Gravedigger, I crawled up from where you buried me.

And now that these wounds no longer bleed,  
I'm out for revenge until I succeed.
