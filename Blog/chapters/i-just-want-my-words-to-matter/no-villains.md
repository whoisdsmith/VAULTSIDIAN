# No Villains

If you were to write your life story, how many of you could say that you didn't have a single villian or negative person in it?

Most of us have at least one person who damaged or broke us in some way that we were never the same afterwards.

Those people were the turning point in whether we chose to hurt others as they did to us

or if we realized

we would never want the people we love to feel the way

all the people that fucked us up did

By the time my story is finished, I won't have a single villain in it because the world has enough shitty people and every person that has ever hurt me, defined me and made me into a better person each time.

So they are not villians, they are just supporting actors and actresses who helped me see a better world and live without negativity.

The best way to take away a villains superpower, is to erase their existence and turn them into something that made you a better person
