I’m sure most of you are unaware that our brains are actually made to work from the source code of the universe, but there’s a few of us out there who have learned how to decode it and rewrite it\. Reading through my own I noticed the first lines of code were very disappointing\.

#info <Smith\.D>

int begin

\{

cout << "Destined To Fail" << endl;

return 0;

\}

So I changed it to

#info <Smith\.D>

int begin

\{

cout << "Has Administrator Privilege To All Internal Coding" << endl;

return 0;

\}

And once I gained full access to all of my default settings, I started changing them one by one, line after line until I got to the final output:

#info <Smith\.D>

int end

\{

cout << "Simulation Is A Sucess" << endl;

return 0;

\}

Once I hit that Enter key, I woke up with the ability to choose more than just the default outcome, I still make mistakes and I still make the wrong choices but instead of repeating them over and over the way I was programmed to, I continuously update those lines of code to have greater odds at making better decisions and with better decisions come a better ending\.
