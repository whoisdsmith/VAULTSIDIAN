# Shadows & Skeletons

## Date: 2-13-13

It's been a long time since I have written words in diary form. It's been a night of defeat, of darkness & of failure.

I've always had some kind of words to say for any situation, but these days I struggle just to open my mouth.

I fumble to put together full sentences & my words usually end up wrong or silent.

I'm not sure when my voice & thoughts started to lose their place, maybe it was once I started taking the meds, or maybe it is something that's been building since my birth.

In the past, I have felt lost, broken & then I felt nothing at all. In the last 16 months I have managed to regain my emotions and purpose for being here, however I seem to lack the proper way to show off those feelings, at least all of them except anger.

Growing up, I had a short fuse and a temper to light it. Somewhere between Jr. High & High School, I seemed to outgrow it, or I just learned how to bury it. Either way, it found a way to outgrow me.

I do know how to love & I know how & what it feels like, but whatever chemical or process it takes to show it gets replaced by failure & anger.

My mind is weak, but my heart is strong, and this past year has made me live & move forward, casting light on what was once darkness.

Today I realized that the torch that's been guiding me, has also been leading my shadow, I found that you may be able to revive the goodness in your soul but at the risk of bringing something bad back as well.

This Shadow,  
This Skeleton,  
This Dark Energy,

That grabs a hold and doesn't let go, it is just a reminder that you cannot bury what you must confront.

The question is, will I find the courage to face it?
