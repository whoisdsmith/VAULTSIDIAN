# How I Feel

## Date: 2-13-13

---- 

**Angry and Upset**

**Why?**

**Solution?**

---- 

1. I feel controlled.
2. I feel like I'm not trusted. 
3. I feel isolated.
4. You're happy one minute, upset the next, for no reason. 
5. I hate being told what I'm feeling when that's not how I feel.
6. I feel like, regardless of what I do, it's not good enough or believable. 
7. I absolutely hate my past being brought up or thrown in my face, especially when it had nothing to do with this relationship.
8. When I start to get upset and walk away or try to calm down, you either follow me or antagonize me, until you get me to lose my temper. 
9. Listening to music has always been a passion, especially to bands that I love and have influenced me. Just because it may sound depressing doesn’t mean I’m depressed or upset. I simply hear it and envision it as beautiful and music that I love.
10. I'm not always right, I make mistakes, but I have grown to see more than just one side or my side.
11. You've tried multiple times to hurt yourself and blame me.
12. All I do is love you, all I want to do is love you and grow old, but all you see are insecurities and false reasons why I can't or don't love you.
13. I don't know who I am anymore, these last 15 months you're all I’ve known, I have never cared about another woman more than I do about you.
