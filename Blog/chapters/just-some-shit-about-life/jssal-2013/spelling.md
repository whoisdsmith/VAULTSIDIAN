I Don't Think It Really Matters What I Write Down Because Two Things Are Going To Happen... 

- One Will Be That I'm Going To Forget What I Want To Say 

And 

- Two Will Be That I Never Finish What I Start. 

So, What's The Point To This Diary Of Madness? 

Well, I Guess I'm Just Hoping To Prove Myself Wrong & Break The Chains Of Being On Auto-Pilot... 

The Same Shit Different Day Routines... 

“Routines” That's The Word I Was Looking For When I Previously Said “Break The Chains Of Being On Auto-Pilot” 

I Didn't Want To Use The Word "Auto-Pilot" 

I Wanted Instead To Use "Routines" 

Fuck It, Anyway, These Are Just Lines On A Sheet Of Paper, Maybe For Use To Start A Fire Some Day Or Maybe To Leave Behind For The People I Love And That Love Me Back. 

In Other News, I Was Momentarily Interrupted By The Neighbors Screaming & Yelling, I Stepped Outside Only To Catch The End Of It... Damn!
