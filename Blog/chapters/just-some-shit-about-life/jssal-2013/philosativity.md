I Have Found That My Creativity Comes & Goes In Unpredictable Waves, Like One Minute I'm In The Middle Of Making The Greatest Shit Ever & Then Bam!! The Next, I’m Swimming In A Kiddie Pool Foaming Out The Mouth As Though I Have Severe Down Syndrome…

Which Maybe I Do, Maybe This Is All In My Head & I'm Just Floating In Some Foreign Abyss Of My Mind.

Nothing Makes Much Sense When I'm In These States Of Mind, As If My Brain Was A Country, Maybe The Brain Is A Country And Every Emotion Is A State.

Why Is It So Hard For Us To Just Stay Put? Sporadically, My Moods Start In Michigan & Travel To Indiana, Which Translates As Michigan = Happy And Indiana = Normal…

Then There Are Days I Wake Up Wondering How I Got To Nebraska, Teleport Back To Michigan & Somehow End The Day In Fucking Iraq…

And As You May Or May Not Know, Iraq Is Not A State Nor Is It Even Connected To The Country That My Brain Is In…

Fuck I Forgot Where I Was Going With This, I Think My Point Was That I Started This Day Off As “Blah” Then It Got Better than I Ended Up In Iraq Which Could Only Mean “Angry & In Hell”.
