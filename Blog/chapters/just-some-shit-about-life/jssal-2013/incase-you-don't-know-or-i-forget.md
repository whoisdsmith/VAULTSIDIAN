## Incase You Don't Know Or I Forget

6-29-13

For Those Who Don't Know & (For Me, Incase I Forget.)

My Name Is Dustin Smith,

But I Prefer D. Smith Because I Love The D. (Insert Bad Drawing Of Wiener Here) I Haven't Even Finished My Intro & I'm Already Making Dick Jokes!

Anyway, I Was Born March 20Th, 1985. I Had A Good Four Years As An 80'S Child, Just Wish I Could Remember Them!

(One Thing I Should Make Clear If I Haven't Already)

My Memory Is Shit! Truth Is, I Don't Remember 90% Of My Youth, Which Sucks Because I Had A Good Life Growing Up With A Loving & Caring Family.

As For Me In My Adult Years, I Don't Remember Much Either And That Makes Shit Really Difficult Because I Hate Forgetting!

Another Thing I Should Mention Is That I Have Adhd & That Complicates Shit Even More.

I Would Also Like To Say There Probably Won't Be Any Kind Of Order To This, So If You're Not Already Confused, Don't Pucker Your Butt Cheeks Because You Most likely Will Be!
