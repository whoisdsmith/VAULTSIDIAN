I Have Made Countless Mistakes & Bad Decisions..

I Learned The Hard Way About Most Of Them.

I've Been To The Top Of The World In Utter Joy & I Have Been To The Deepest Shit Holes In Hell.

These Words Can't Express How Much You Mean To Me, Or How Much I Love You.

One Day When You Have A Child Of Your Own You Will Understand.

My Hope Is That You Grow Up To Be A Better Man Than Me..

That You Choose Love Over Money & Hoes..

That You Learn To Control That Inner Anger That You Get From Me And Use It To Create Something Positive From It.

I Am Proud Of Who You Are, And I Have Faith That You Will Continue To Grow Into A Great Man..

I Don't Tell You That I Love You As Much As I Should. I Hope One Day You Understand Why Iâ€™m Not In Your Life Every Day.

I Love You, Son
