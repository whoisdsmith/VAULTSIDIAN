It's one of those days where I feel like I'm drowning and every time I try to catch a breath of air, the undertow pulls me right back down from all the shit inside my head that;s weighing me down.the weight of all the shit inside my head just can't keep me afloat.

Up ahead,  and I know I'm getting closer because the ocean is getting more shallow I continue swimming towards it, I'm so tired and exhausted from fighting the constant current that's in my way, especially when it's so much easier to just stop and let the current take me in the other direction, so that I can rest my eyes and my thoughts and scream that I don't give a fuck and just be done, but that's not who I am. I've fought for so long to hold on to the things that have long let me go. It's who I am, I don't believe in giving up on the things or the people that I love,

I can see dry land and the island that's full of all the good and the beautiful things in my life
