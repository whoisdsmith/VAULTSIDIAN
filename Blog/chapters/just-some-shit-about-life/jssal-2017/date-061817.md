I Really Want To Write To Inspire, I Want To Be Known For Something Positive, Someone Who Was Able To Help Others Who Are Going Through Some Badshit.

For The Last Few Years Ive Been Consumed With So Much Negativity & During That Time I Was Unable To See Not Only The Good Things But The Effects I Had On People Around Me, Most Of All My Children.

I Wish I Had Gotten Myself Out Of That Situation Years Ago, But I Was So Convinced I Could Change The Situation Outcome.

Towards The End Of That Relationship I Was Changing, I Was Becoming A Better Man By Acknowledging My Flaws And My Mistakes, But Sometimes Itâ€™s Just Too Late To Save Something That Was Always Doomed From The Start.

Life Can Be So Hard Sometimes, Especialy When We Are The Ones Who Choose To Make Decisions That Can Come Back & Bite Us In The Ass.
