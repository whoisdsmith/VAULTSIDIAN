# Day 31

I will take advantage of every day that I feel like this because I know days like yesterday they will still happen but as time goes by it will be less and less. I have grown up enough to accept the things for what they are and to understand and stay humble during this new chapter in my life.

Here's the one thing I've really taken from all of this.

Love does not rescue you, it doesn't take you away from whatever situation you're in with somebody else. it doesn't chase you all over the world and it sure as hell doesn't make you chase it back. Love is something that comes out of nowhere, it meets you in the middle when you're ready and when it is ready. You can go out and look for it all you want but you're just going to be disappointed, you have to use time and patience to it's advantage and I guess that's what the hardest part is, but the sooner you awknowledge that, the faster your mind and your heart will heal and the sooner you will meet in the middle.
