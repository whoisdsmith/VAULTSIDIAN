# Day 64

Feeling incredibly sad today, just full on depressed as fuck. It's bringing out the worst in me and I can't seem to get past it. My doubts and insecurities have let themselves loose upon me. Everytime I see Stevie my fucking stomach just ties itself in knots, I feel sick, I feel sad and I just want to wake up from this dream. Why can't this all just be a bad dream?

I didn't deserve any of this, I don't know who the fuck I am anymore. Ive never been able to tuck my feelings or emotions away and act like I'm just fine. I don't wear my heart on my sleeve, I wear it on my face and in the words I say. How am I supposed to let go when I fear there is nobody else out there that I will feel so passionately for. I know that relationship was fucked up and that it was because of her and her issues, but I thought I was somebody different to her, now I'm just like her last husband. Just some guy who pays her every Friday to see our children on the weekends. I'm nothing more than a stranger to her, I am a ghost floating through this life and the only thing that I haunt is myself. I just wish I could live up to the words I've been saying but this slump I've fallen into outweighs that motivation to better my life. Maybe I was always destined to be a sad piece of shit who goes nowhere in life but into a box 6 ft in the dirt buried all alone.
