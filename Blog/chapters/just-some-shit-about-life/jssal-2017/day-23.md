# Day 23

I wrote an alternate ending for my marriage, not about something fictional but how it really should have ended. All stories come to an end, but I never really saw ours ending the way it did. The original ending is full of missing pages and confusion and too much hate, anger and pain. I was the victim and my wife was the villain. That's the ending most of you know, which is definitely one that would leave you wanting a refund for the sheer amount of disappointment. That ending left me feeling unable to move on without proper closure. So I wrote a better ending of how it all should have played out, this time around me and my wife are both the victim's because of years and years of miscommunication and misunderstandings. By the last paragraph we both end up on the same page and we forgive each other and we give the answers to all those questions that got stuck in limbo. We hugged each other one last time and wished nothing but the best as we journey on to the next chapter in our lives without each other. I'm sure this all sounds confusing as fuck but I started defining my life as a book and each new major event started a new chapter me and my wife had the longest chapter to date but I won't accept the original ending because at the end of the day I just can't allow myself to hate. I have this gift or curse of being able to forgive someone no matter what happened.
