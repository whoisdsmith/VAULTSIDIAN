# Day 51

Forgetting you is not an option, it was not built into the features of who I am and who I am now has a lot to do with who I became when I was with you.

In the end there wasn't a whole lot of good things I could say about you or our relationship, but every new day I wake up, I start to see through that pain and that anger you caused me. I still think of you everyday, sometimes all day and sometimes only right before I fall asleep. I Let Go of any hope of us making this marriage work, when you made me move out and you moved him into our home as soon as I left. I believe it is possible to miss the good things that we had and still be able to move on without you cause I've been doing it ever since I left. Some days I hold on for dear life to that resentment because it's what I need to do to be able to keep moving forward. Some days I dig deep for anything that was positive between us to also help me keep moving forward. Just depends on my mood, and what the situation I'm in may be. It's a constant battle of my mind in my heart, I can't keep playing both sides forever cause I know that in the end that pain and resentment will not be a part of me or who I want to be. When I'm I'm finally ready to move into my next relationship there will be nothing negative leading into it other wise I will just cause myself and someone else unnecessary pain.
