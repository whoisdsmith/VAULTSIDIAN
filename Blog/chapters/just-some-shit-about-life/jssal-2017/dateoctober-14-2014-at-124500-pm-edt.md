Happiness is much like DNA, it's different for everyone. What makes you happy may not be the same guidelines that make others happy. To me, happiness is something that should not be felt 100% of the time, if you are never sad or angry than how do you know you are happy? Happiness should be a reminder of all the things you love and that make you smile but not something that should stick around long enough that you forget to appreciate its value. Instead, you can choose to always be grateful. If you believe that money or medicine or a new relationship will make you find happiness, than you will always be looking for more money, more doctors or more people. We are all capable of being happy, the key is to define it yourself and to be grateful for the things you have even after all of your misfortunes. That's a start anyways
