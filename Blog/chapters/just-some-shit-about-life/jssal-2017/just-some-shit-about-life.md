Here Is What Iâ€™ve Learned

- To See This As An Opprotunity To Be A Better Father, Friend &Be A Better Man.

- It's Better To Sleep Alone Than To Sleep Next Someone Who Would Rather Be Sleeping Next To Someone Else.

- Parts Of Me Are Being Rebuilt, But I Am Not Broken. I Will Love Again, And I'll Love With Even More Passion.

- I Will Learn To Forgive You, And I Will Wish You The Best With The Upmost Sincerity. I May Be Dead To You, But You Are Very Much Still Alive To Me, You Meant Something You Meant Everything To Me, I Will Never Erase The Good Days & I Will Be The Best Version Of Me To Someone Eise, Someone Who Wont Give Up
