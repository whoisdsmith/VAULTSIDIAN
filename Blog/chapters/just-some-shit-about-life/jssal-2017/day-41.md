# Day 41

I don't really think I've felt this much negativity towards anyone in my life, I thought I hated my son's mom when she left me but this runs much deeper than that ever did, because we had a family together and plans and even got married, I never thought I would get married and she just fucking ruined it for me. I wish I never met up with her that first night we got together. She's a fucking poison I can't get out out of my system. Every where I go, there's memories of us, everything I do I vision her reaction, she's the worst thing that ever happened to me
