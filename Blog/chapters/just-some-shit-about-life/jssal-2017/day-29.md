# Day 29

Taryn stayed the night last night, we cuddled and got 3 hrs of sleep.

Worked 6-3pm

Chris gave me $400 to buy Jessie's car

Grandma Herman picked me up from work

Stevie dropped the girls off at 5pm

She came inside the house and made reciepts for me to give to FOTC.

Had a fun night with the girls
