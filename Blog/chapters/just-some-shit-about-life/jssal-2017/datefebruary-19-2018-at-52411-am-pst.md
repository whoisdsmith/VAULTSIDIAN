What is love? To me love isn't just waking up next to you and smiling at your beautiful face first thing in the morning. Love is looking up to see somebody who cares about you with everything they have even when you're mess and hard to be around isn't just about happiness it's about commitment, it's about sacrifice, it's pain, frustration, irritability, love is about doing whatever it takes to put a smile on your lover space when they can't seem to smile at all. Love is more than just a four letter word, it's more that just something you say to somebody you care about it's that feeling you get deep down in your soul when you would give up everything even your own soul save the person you care about. It's about fighting for what you want the most, it's about being patient and setting your own pride aside even when you believe you're right in certain situations. Love is what makes us all better, it's the wind in our sails, the will to keep going on days when you feel like giving up the most. Love is staying up all through the night being disappointed in yourself for the way you reacted during conversation. Love is Beautiful.Love Is You it's something you feel deep down in your soul when you're lost inside your mind and you feel trapped and empty
