# How they make you feel

Throughout life, I've often heard people say “you never forget the way people make you feel”  
and that is.. so spot on.  

you never forget the way somebody you love ignores you or neglects you or chooses to spend their time with somebody else.  

Those feelings they stay with you forever.
