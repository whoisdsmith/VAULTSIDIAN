# Yesterday, I Started My Journey with Obsidian. Kind Of.–MTHRFCKR

Technically, I started in late October of 2021, but was instantly overwhelmed by my lack of knowledge and understanding with both the app itself and with Markdown. It also doesn’t help that I am insanely ADHD and lack very little patience when it comes to learning new things.

Yesterday I finally took the time to give it another shot. The first thing I did was go to YouTube and searched for tutorials.

I naturally selected the first result that came up [Obsidian for Beginners: Start HERE – How to Use the Obsidian App for Notes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgbLb6QCK88) and was really impressed at how easy it was to follow along and how well Nick Milo from “Linking Your Thinking” does his video’s.

I guess I should mention that I took some time to learn the basics of Markdown a few weeks ago, so coming into Obsidian wasn’t nearly as overwhelming. Below is a list of links that I found to be the most helpful.

[Day One Journal-Markdown Guide](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/440596-markdown-guide)

After I finished Linking Your Thinking’s “Start Here Tutorial” I began to explore and play around with Obsidian the rest of the day.

By the end of the day I managed to import all of my [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) Journal’s and all of my Apple Notes, along with any Markdown README.md files I had from my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/p4rk0ur)

That’s all for now.

Excited to see what new things I learn today!
