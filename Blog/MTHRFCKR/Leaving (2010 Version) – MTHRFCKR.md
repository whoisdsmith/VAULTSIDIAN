# Leaving (2010 Version)–MTHRFCKR

She said “this is for the best, I don’t care if you think I’m being selfish”  
I replied with “he’s all that I have left, what am I suppose to do without him?”  
She said “I don’t care what you do, cause we’re leaving when the courts say we can move”  
I replied with “what did I do to you to deserve all this hell you’ve put me through?”

I haven’t slept in days and I hate being awake, knowing there’s nothing I can do to stop you now. You’re on your way traveling 2000 miles away, I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I can’t think. I don’t want to think without you

What do you say since you’ve been over there, do you tell him that I just don’t care?  
What will you say when he wonders about me?  
Will you tell him that life’s not fair or that it’s my fault that you’re over there?  
What do you feel when he talks about me?

She said “this is for the best, I dont care if you think I’m being selfish”  
I replied with “How do you know what’s best, when we both know he doesn’t understand this?”  
She said “I don’t care what you think, cause come December we are moving out of this state”  
I replied with “I’ll never understand how you could be so damn cold when were so close”

Days go by and still everything’s the same, I’ve spent everyday blaming myself for things I couldn’t change. 

What does he say when he’s over there, does he ask you if I even care?  
What do you tell him about me?  
Do you say that I’m doing my best or that I’m just a loser like all the rest?  
What will it take to make this right?
