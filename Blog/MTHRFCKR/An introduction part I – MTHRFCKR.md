# An Introduction Part I–MTHRFCKR

---

## [Uncategorized](https://whoisdsmith.ctrlaltback.space/category/uncategorized/) · August 8, 2011

I am new at this blog stuff, I’m going to try and use this as a new kind of therapy for myself. I read a few blogs that inspired me to try and describe my thoughts. I guess I will start with an introduction..

Part I

I am Dustin Smith. My best friend Kristin started calling me D. Smith about 3 years ago and it has stuck ever since. I am the only child of my mother and my adoptive father, I have 2 sisters and 3 brothers from my seed donor. I don’t talk to any of them except my brother James, he’s in the army and stationed in iraq, thanks to Facebook we’ve gotten close the past year or two, other than that I haven’t seen him in 20 years. 

I have a 6 yr old son Everett Tyler Lee Smith. He is by far the best thing that ever happened to me, it’s easy to talk about him but hard not to get emotional over it. He lives in Fort Benning, GA with his mom, little brother and step dad. I have missed out on more of his life than I have been in it. The first few years were due to neglect cause I thought I could become the next big thing at my job. I worked so much that I don’t remember his entire first year. It never even bothered me back then. Looking back now I can’t help but to beat myself up over it. A job is just a job no matter what it is or how much you make, it should never be more important than your family or the people you love. I hope one day we can be together more than just the summer and a few holidays.. I hope one day I can forgive myself for the things I’ve done, but I swear that little boy means everything to me and without him here I always end up lost.

I have been in 3 serious relationships since I was sixteen. One of them was for 3 months, the other was 6 weeks, and my first one was for almost 7 years. That was with my sons mom. She showed me a love I have yet to find from anyone else, not because I haven’t tried but because that kind of love takes years to get. She is truly a wonderful woman and two years ago I wouldn’t be caught dead giving her a compliment. We have been through hell together but during that hell we learned how to grow and to forgive. Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever love someone as much as I did her. It’s been 4 years this august since she left me for the man who is now her husband. They had a son together 2 1/2 years ago and Everett loves him to death. It took me almost the entire four years to let go and accept that the past is the past and we can’t go back. I think she goes mostly by Rebecca now but she will always be Becca to me. She showed me how to really care about another human being, it was a hard lesson to learn cause I had to watch her fall out of love with me and fall into it with someone else, but in the end I realized all of my flaws and the things I needed to change if I am ever to have a lasting relationship again. I am happy she is happy, I know for a long time she wished she could forget me but I hope now when she looks back she smiles and I hope she never forgets those teenage years we spent together. In the last few months we started being friends, in the past we were either lovers or haters towards each other, we never developed a friendship. I am thankful that we can talk as friends now. Between her and my son I could write pages and pages because they were and are the biggest parts of my life.
