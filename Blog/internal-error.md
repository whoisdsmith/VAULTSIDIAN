Do you ever stop and ask yourself 

	How did I get here? 
		When did this path I’ve been on, start to veer off course? 
			Why did I make those decisions that initially lead me to here?
    

Every day is the same day over and over again. 

    

It’s like no matter what I do or say, when I go to bed and wake up the next day, everything resets and starts all over again

    

Life has become a simulation that I can’t outrun.
