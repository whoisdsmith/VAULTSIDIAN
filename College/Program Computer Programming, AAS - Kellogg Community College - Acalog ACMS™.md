## Program Description

*Code 214 - 60-61 Credits*

The Computer Programming program establishes a core of the skills needed as a programmer in the most widely used languages that are being used currently. We will emphasize the development of fundamental logic and problem-solving skills in the core curriculum courses. Through the elective courses, the student may choose to emphasize additional skills in application use, application programming, networking, or operating systems.

In this evolving world of information technology, there has been a growing need for those who have the skills to do computer programming in a variety of languages and environments. With the ever-expanding world of gaming, there is the desire to go from computer game player to computer game writer. To explore this option we have added a specific set of electives with the computer programming coursework. This includes all the fundamentals in popular programming languages and problem-solving skills. These fundamentals are expanded to explore the insight a programmer needs to develop computer games. Courses have been selected to increase the understanding of both two and three-dimensional graphics. In addition, courses have been selected to improve the understanding from the perspective of the gamer and developing the story of the game. This degree will allow the student to explore the possibility of game programming while still providing the student with the fundamentals that all computer programming requires.

The candidate for an Associate of Applied Science Degree in Computer Programming may select from the two elective options: Computer Programming or Game Design.

### Service-Learning Requirement

Students who obtain an Associate degree or an Associate of Applied Science degree will be required to complete a service-learning experience. The final grade in the course must qualify for academic credit in order to receive the service-learning endorsement. Please contact an Academic Advisor for courses that offer a service-learning experience, or search in the class schedules.

## Prerequisite Requirements

Strong reading skills and some background in problem solving and mathematics are recommended prior to attempting courses in the Computer Programming program.

## Admissions

See the following link for program admission information: [https://kellogg.edu/admissions/](https://kellogg.edu/admissions/).

## Program Learning Outcomes

---

1. Students will be able to communicate technical information both orally and in writing.
2. Students will demonstrate proficiency with computer programming constructs in both procedural and object-oriented programming using several programming languages. These will be utilized for the student to and be able to produce and develop text-based and graphical user interface applications.
3. The student will be able to apply critical thinking in the development of programs within the entire program life cycle.
4. An ability to apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the program’s student outcomes and to the discipline.

## Required General Education Courses
