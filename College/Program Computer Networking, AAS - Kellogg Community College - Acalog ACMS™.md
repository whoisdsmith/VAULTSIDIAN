## Program Description

*Code 216 - 60 Credits*

The Computer Networking program at Kellogg Community College prepares students to enter the career of computer server and networking administration, wiring/cabling, as well as those already working in the industry who need to upgrade their skills for new responsibilities or career growth. The program includes a rigorous curriculum of classroom and hands-on lab experiences that prepare the student for success in small or large businesses. Successful completion of program requirements provides the student with an Associate of Applied Science Degree in Computer Networking.

No industry drives the rapid changes in new technology as completely as the computer and networking sectors. There are both local and worldwide employment opportunities for knowledgeable and skilled technicians, who possess computer troubleshooting/repair skills, network installation/management skills, computer programming skills, database administration skills, and computer-related, industry-endorsed certifications. With an increasing world emphasis on computer technology, the projected demand for computers, programming, database administrators, and network administrators will remain exceptionally high.

The Computer Networking program emphasizes the state-of-the-art knowledge and skills needed to prepare students for a challenging and exciting career in this fast-paced, high-tech, rapidly growing industry. These programs are also designed to prepare students to take the industry-based certification exams, including A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, Cloud+, Cisco Wireless LAN Support Specialist, Panduit Authorized Installer (PAI), and Cisco CCENT. We also provide training in our certified Microsoft Academy for Microsoft Certified Solutions Associate (MCSA) certification.

The Computer Engineering Technology degree programs are designed for individuals just beginning training to pursue a career in computer servicing, wiring/cabling, programming, and networking, as well as those already working in the industry who need to upgrade their skills for new responsibilities or career growth.
