## Program Description

*Code 201 - 62 Credits*

The Cyber Security program is designed to prepare students with the knowledge, skills and abilities in computing technologies, networking and programming that are required to be successful in the cyber security field. Cyber security workers help prevent attacks through their expertise and knowledge of databases, networks, hardware, firewalls, and encryption. They keep computer systems running smoothly, prevent the theft of financial and personal information, and block intruders from accessing and divulging proprietary data.  Upon completion of this degree, the student will be better prepared for the opportunities and an increasing number of jobs that are requiring this knowledge and skill set. This program incorporates the preparation for current and future industry certifications in cyber security.
