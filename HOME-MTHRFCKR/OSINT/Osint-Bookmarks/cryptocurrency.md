> -   Collaboration, it turns out, gets harder in proportion to two things: the level of coherence you demand from the output, and the complexity of the processes that create it.
> -   Collaboration that creates incoherence is easy. You all just do whatever you want. Equally, collaboration on things that are not complex is easy. You can all see whether the log has been chopped or not, there is limited room for debate.
> -   On the other hand, lets say that instead we first come up with a clear overarching plan for what we‚Äôre doing. This makes it much more likely the outcome will be coherent. But the price we pay is having to handle the complexity of the entire challenge all at once.

-   [Brandolini's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini%27s_law) - also known as the bullshit asymmetry principle, is an internet adage which emphasizes the difficulty of debunking bullshit: "The amount of energy needed to refute bullshit is an order of magnitude larger than to produce it."

> Improvement is something we should do all the time, not once every two weeks in a retrospective. When a problem emerges, don't wait. Fix it. Do everything you can to instill a culture of continuous improvement throughout the organization. An improvements board is one way to do that in the small.

> -   The faster you react, the less you think. Not always, but often.
> -   It‚Äôs fine to disagree, it‚Äôs fine to push back, it‚Äôs great to have strong opinions and beliefs, but give my ideas some time to set in before you‚Äôre sure you want to argue against them.
> -   There‚Äôs also a difference between asking questions and pushing back. Pushing back means you already think you know. Asking questions means you want to know. Ask more questions.
> -   So next time you hear something, or someone, talk about an idea, pitch an idea, or suggest an idea, give it five minutes. Think about it a little bit before pushing back, before saying it‚Äôs too hard or it‚Äôs too much work. Those things may be true, but there may be another truth in there too: It may be worth it.
