## Note

There are four instruments: an articulated drone which comes and goes, a wandering melodic line which is a simple arpeggiation of a hexachord that I’ve used often, a polyphonic wind rattle which is layered amplitude-modulated noise, and a claves-like strike which focuses our attention. It is held together with plenty of random movement and reverb.

The piece is generative. It could run for hours. It is ambient. Except for the occasional claves strike, there is little that deliberately grabs our attention. And, it is aleatoric. The sounds come and go at random intervals, both at the macro and micro levels.
