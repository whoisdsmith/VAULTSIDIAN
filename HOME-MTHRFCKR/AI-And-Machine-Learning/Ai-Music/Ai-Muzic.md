# AI-Muzic

---

**Muzic** is a research project on AI music that empowers music understanding and generation with deep learning and artificial intelligence.  
Muzic is pronounced as [ˈmjuːzeik] Besides the logo in image version (see above), Muzic also has a logo in video version

We summarize the scope of our Muzic project in the following figure:

The current work in [Muzic](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-music/) include:

* Music Understanding

  + Symbolic Music Understanding: [MusicBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05630)
  + Automatic Lyrics Transcription: [PDAugment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07940)

* Music Generation

  + Song Writing: [SongMASS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05168)
  + Lyric Generation: [DeepRapper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01875)
  + Lyric-to-Melody Generation: [TeleMelody](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09617), [ReLyMe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05688), [Re-creation of Creations (ROC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05697)
  + Melody Generation: [MeloForm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14345), [Museformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10349)
  + Accompaniment Generation: [PopMAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07703)
  + Singing Voice Synthesis: [HiFiSinger](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.01776)

  You can find some music samples generated by our systems from this page: https://ai-muzic.github.io/.

## We are hiring

We are hiring both research FTEs and research interns on **AI music, speech, audio, language, and machine learning**. Please contact Xu Tan (xuta@microsoft.com) if you have interests.

## What is New

+ We release two new research work on music structure modeling: [MeloForm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14345) and [Museformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10349).
+ We give a tutorial on [AI Music Composition](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2021/10/Tutorial-on-AI-Music-Composition-@ACM-MM-2021.pdf) at [ACM Multimedia 2021](https://2021.acmmm.org/).

# Requirements

The operating system is Linux. We test on Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS, CUDA 10, with Python 3.6.12. The requirements for running Muzic are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install the requirements, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We release the code of several research work: [MusicBERT](musicbert), [PDAugment](pdaugment), [DeepRapper](deeprapper), [SongMASS](songmass), [TeleMelody](telemelody), [ReLyMe](relyme), [Re-creation of Creations (ROC)](roc), [MeloForm](meloform), and [Museformer](museformer). You can find the README in the corresponding folder for detailed instructions on how to use.
