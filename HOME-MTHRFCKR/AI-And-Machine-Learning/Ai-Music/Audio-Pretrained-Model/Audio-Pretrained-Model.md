## What Is Pre-trained Model?

A Pre-trained Model Is A Model Created By Some One Else To Solve A Similar Problem. Instead Of Building A Model From Scratch To Solve A Similar Problem, We Can Use The Model Trained On Other Problem As A Starting Point. A Pre-trained Model May Not Be 100% Accurate In Your Application.
