# Paid Textbooks

A List Of Non-free Textbooks On Audio DSP.

- [`Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins In C++`] And [`Designing Audio Effect Plugins In C++`] By Will Pirkle
  - One Of The Most Highly Recommended Resources For Entering The World Of Audio DSP.
  - Great Beginner Resource That Teaches Fundamental DSP Concepts Without Going Into Too Much Mathematics.
  - The Synthesizer One Is Better Than The Effect One Imo, So Go For That If You Plan On Only Buying One.
  - Focuses On Teaching Concepts, Not On Writing Performant Code. His Coding Style Is Quite Ineffecient For Real-world Use.
  - ISBN-10: 0367510480 And 1138591939, ISBN-13: 978-0367510480 And 978-1138591936
- [`A Digital Signal Processing Primer`] By Kenneth Steiglitz
  - Great Introduction To The Mathematics Of DSP.
  - Focuses More On Mathematics And Does Not Have Many Example Effects.
  - ISBN-10: 0486845834, ISBN-13: 978-0486845838
- [`DAFX: Digital Audio Effects`] By Udo ZÃ¶lzer (Editor)
  - Explores Good Modern Advanced Effects. It's Made By The [`DAFx`] Annual Scientific Research Conference.
  - MATLAB Is Used For Its Code Examples, But [`GNU Octave`] Could Probably Be Used As Well.
  - ISBN-10: 0470665998, ISBN-13: 978-0470665992
- [`Digital Signal Processing: Concepts And Applications`] By Mulgrew, Grant & Thompson
  - Covers The Basic Principles Of DSP In An Easy-to-digest Way Without Going Into Too Much Mathematics.
  - Focuses More On General DSP Rather Than Audio DSP.
  - Uses MATLAB For Its Code Examples, But [`GNU Octave`] Could Probably Be Used As Well.
  - ISBN-10: 0333963563, ISBN-13: 978-0333963562
- [`Digital Signal Processing: A Practical Guide For Engineers And Scientists`] By Steven Smith
  - Another Book Recommended To Beginners.
  - Focuses More On General DSP Rather Than Audio DSP.
  - Uses MATLAB For Its Code Examples, But [`GNU Octave`] Could Probably Be Used As Well.
  - ISBN-10: 075067444X, ISBN-13: 978-0750674447
