## VGGish checkpoint

The [train script][i-train] will download for you automatically if  
it can't find one. But you can also download manually and put it  
in this directory:

- [vggish_model.ckpt][vggish-ckpt]
- [vggish_pca_params.npz][vggish-pca]

[i-train]: ../../audio_train.py
[vggish-ckpt]: https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_model.ckpt
[vggish-pca]: https://storage.googleapis.com/audioset/vggish_pca_params.npz
