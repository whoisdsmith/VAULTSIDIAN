- [Artist Studies](https://remidurant.com/artists) - I believe the world gets a bit brighter with each piece of art we create. The wonderful thing about AI art is that it is allowing more people to tap into their own creativity. I've learned that one of the biggest tricks to generating great AI art is to include the names of prominent real world artists in your prompt, so I set out to explore what artists will work well, and what styles, colors, and subjects their names evoke.
