# Set the Base URL for the API

`API_BASE_URL = "https://api.raindrop.io/rest/v1"`

# Set the Collection ID

`collection_id = 12345`

# Set the API Key

`api_key = "your-api-key"`

# Set the Request Headers

```
headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "API-Key": api_key
}
```

# Set the Request Parameters

```
params = {
    "collection": collection_id
}
```

# Make the GET Request to the /bookmarks Endpoint

`response = requests.get(f"{API_BASE_URL}/bookmarks", headers=headers, params=params)`

# Check the Status Code of the Response

if response.status_code == 200:

# If the Request Was Successful, the Response Will Contain a JSON Array of Bookmarks

    bookmarks = response.json()

    # You can now access the list of bookmarks in the bookmarks variable
    print(bookmarks)

else:

# If the Request Was Not Successful, the Response Will Contain an Error Message

    error = response.json()
    print(error)

Keep in mind that in order to use the raindrop.io API, you will need to have an API key. You can obtain an API key by creating an account on raindrop.io and then generating an API key in your account settings.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
