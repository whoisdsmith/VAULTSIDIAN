Create a C# class to serialize and deserialize a JSON rpc request with the following specifications:
- Class Name: Use PascalCase with a "_RPC" suffix, e.g. `{ClassName}_RPC`
- Base Class: Derive from `RPCTemplate<{ClassName}_RPC>`
- XML Comments: Include [yes]
- Constructors: completely omit
- Property Naming: Use snake_case (e.g. `used_for_farmer_rewards`). Do not use attributes like [JsonPropertyName("used_for_farmer_rewards")]
- Lists: Implement as arrays [yes]
- Positive Integers: Use the [ulong] type
- Excluded Properties: Completely omit [success], [error] (already part of the base class)
- Excluded Functions: Completely omit [serialize], [deserialize], [save], [load] (already part of the base class)
- Base Class: Already present, omit it from your response
- Nullable Properties: Mark optional properties as nullable

If additional documentation about the server response is provided, include it for xml comments and specifications:
```
{Optional}
```

This is the original JSON rpc to convert into the class:
```
{Mandatory}
```
