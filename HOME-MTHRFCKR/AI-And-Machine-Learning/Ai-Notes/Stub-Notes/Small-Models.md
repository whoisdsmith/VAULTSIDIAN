## History

- Computer Vision practitioners will remember when [SqueezeNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07360) came out in 2017, achieving a 50x reduction in model size compared to [AlexNet](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/hash/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Abstract.html), while meeting or exceeding its accuracy.
- [DistilBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) is perhaps its most widely known achievement. Compared to the original BERT model, it retains 97% of language understanding while being 40% smaller and 60% faster. You can try it [here](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased). The same approach has been applied to other models, such as Facebook's [BART](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13461), and you can try DistilBART [here](https://huggingface.co/models?search=distilbart).
-  [Big Science](https://bigscience.huggingface.co/) project are also very impressive. As visible in this graph included in the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08207), their T0 model outperforms GPT-3 on many tasks while being 16x smaller.
