- Vision Transformers (ViT) Explained https://www.pinecone.io/learn/vision-transformers/
	- team at Google Brain introduced [vision transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HbXG-ZkwAj82Nv49uUrBwOHz4zUj3mkyjIfEd5lU7h3JHZR0pEG5OpkUCPPqwWvqMbjWl) (ViTs) in 2020, and the architecture has undergone nonstop refinement since then. The latest efforts adapt ViTs to new tasks and address their shortcomings.
	-   ViTs learn best from immense quantities of data, so researchers at Meta and Sorbonne University concentrated on [improving performance on datasets of (merely) millions of examples](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/a-formula-for-training-vision-transformers/). They boosted performance using transformer-specific adaptations of established procedures such as data augmentation and model regularization.
	-   Researchers at Inha University modified two key components to make ViTs [more like convolutional neural networks](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/less-data-for-vision-transformers/). First, they divided images into patches with more overlap. Second, they modified self-attention to focus on a patch's neighbors rather than on the patch itself, and enabled it to learn whether to weigh neighboring patches more evenly or more selectively. These modifications brought a significant boost in accuracy.
	-   Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay [outfitted ViTs with convolutional layers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/upgrade-for-vision-transformers/). Convolution brings benefits like local processing of pixels and smaller memory footprints due to weight sharing. With respect to accuracy and speed, their convolutional ViT outperformed the usual version as well as runtime optimizations of transformers such as Performer, Nyströformer, and Linear Transformer. Other teams took [similar](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.09792?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HbXG-ZkwAj82Nv49uUrBwOHz4zUj3mkyjIfEd5lU7h3JHZR0pEG5OpkUCPPqwWvqMbjWl) [approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06709?utm_campaign=The%20Batch&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8HbXG-ZkwAj82Nv49uUrBwOHz4zUj3mkyjIfEd5lU7h3JHZR0pEG5OpkUCPPqwWvqMbjWl).

		- ([summary](https://twitter.com/sedielem/status/1339929984836788228)) To synthesise realistic megapixel images, learn a high-level discrete representation with a conditional GAN, then train a transformer on top. Likelihood-based models like transformers do better at capturing diversity compared to GANs, but tend to get lost in the details. Likelihood is mode-covering; not mode-seeking, like adversarial losses are. By measuring the likelihood in a space where texture details have been abstracted away, the transformer is forced to capture larger-scale structure, and we get great compositions as a result. Replacing the VQ-VAE with a VQ-GAN enables more aggressive downsampling.

## Stable Diffusion Prompts

The basic intuition of Stable Diffusion is that you have to add descriptors to get what you want.

Prompts might go in the form of 

```
[Prefix] [Subject], [Enhancers]
```

Adding the right enhancers can really tweak the outcome:

	- "We already reduced time to gen 50 steps from 5.6s to 0.9s working with nvidia"
	- https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03142
		- For diffusion models trained on the latent-space (e.g., Stable Diffusion), our approach is able to generate high-fidelity images using as few as 1 to 4 denoising steps, accelerating inference by at least 10-fold compared to existing methods on ImageNet 256x256 and LAION datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on text-guided image editing and inpainting, where our distilled model is able to generate high-quality results using as few as 2-4 denoising steps.

- https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1595731398450634755
  - V2 prompts different and will take a while for folk to get used to. V2 is trained on two models, a generator model and a image-to-text model (CLIP).
  - We supported @laion_ai in their creation of an OpenCLIP Vit-H14 https://twitter.com/wightmanr/status/1570503598538379264
  - We released two variants of the 512 model which I would recommend folk dig into, especially the -v model.. More on these soon. The 768 model I think will improve further from here as the first of its type, we will have far more regular updates, releases and variants from here
  - Elsewhere I would highly recommend folk dig into the depth2img model, fun things coming there. 3D maps will improve, particularly as we go onto 3D models and some other fun stuff to be announced in the new year. These models are best not zero-shot, but as part of a process  
- Stable Diffusion 2.X was trained on LAION-5B as opposed to "laion-improved-aesthetics" (a subset of laion2B-en). for Stable Diffusion 1.X.

## Hardware Requirements

- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32642255#32646761
  - For something like this, you ideally would want a powerful GPU with 12-24gb VRAM. 
  - A $500 RTX 3070 with 8GB of VRAM can generate 512x512 images with 50 steps in 7 seconds.

### SD Distros

- **Installer Distros**: Programs that bundle Stable Diffusion in an installable program, no separate setup and the least amount of git/technical skill needed, usually bundling one or more UI
  - iPad: [Draw Things App](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6444050820)
  - [Diffusion Bee](https://github.com/divamgupta/diffusionbee-stable-diffusion-ui) (open source): Diffusion Bee is the easiest way to run Stable Diffusion locally on your M1 Mac. Comes with a one-click installer. No dependencies or technical knowledge needed.
  - https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui: Easiest 1-click way to install and use Stable Diffusion on your own computer. Provides a browser UI for generating images from text prompts and images. Just enter your text prompt, and see the generated image. (Linux, Windows, no Mac). 
  - https://nmkd.itch.io/t2i-gui: A basic (for now) Windows 10/11 64-bit GUI to run Stable Diffusion, a machine learning toolkit to generate images from text, locally on your own hardware. As of right now, this program only works on Nvidia GPUs! AMD GPUs are not supported. In the future this might change. 
  - [imaginAIry 🤖🧠](https://github.com/brycedrennan/imaginAIry) (SUPPORTS SD 2.0!): Pythonic generation of stable diffusion images with just `pip install imaginairy`. "just works" on Linux and macOS(M1) (and maybe windows). Memory efficiency improvements, prompt-based editing, face enhancement, upscaling, tiled images, img2img, prompt matrices, prompt variables, BLIP image captions, comes with dockerfile/colab.  Has unit tests.
    - Note: it goes a lot faster if you run it all inside the included aimg CLI, since then it doesn't have to reload the model from disk every time

	- -   A model is a 2GB+ file that can do basically anything. It takes a lot of VRAM to train and has a large file size.
	-   A hypernetwork is an 80MB+ file that sits on top of a model and can learn new things not present in the base model. It is relatively easy to train, but is typically less flexible than an embedding when using it in other models.	    
	-   An embedding is a 4KB+ file (yes, 4 kilobytes, it's very small) that can be applied to any model that uses the same base model, which is typically the base stable diffusion model. It cannot learn new content, rather it creates magical keywords behind the scenes that tricks the model into creating what you want.
