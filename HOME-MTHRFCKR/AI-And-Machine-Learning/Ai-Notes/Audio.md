## Transcription (Speech to Text or ASR)

- https://github.com/openai/whisper
  - the --initial_prompt CLI arg: For my use, I put a bunch of industry jargon and names that are commonly misspelled in there and that fixes 1/3 to 1/2 of the errors.
  - https://freesubtitles.ai/ (hangs my browser when i try it)
  - https://github.com/mayeaux/generate-subtitles
  - [theory](https://twitter.com/ethanCaballero/status/1572692314400628739?s=20&t=j_XtR82eEW6Vp28YvodqJQ): whisper is a way to get more tokens from youtube for gpt4
  - Buzz transcribes and translates audio offline on your personal computer. Powered by OpenAI's Whisper. 
  - whisper running on $300 device https://twitter.com/drjimfan/status/1616471309961269250?s=46&t=4t17Fxog8a65leEnHNZwVw
- https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp  
  High-performance inference of OpenAI's Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) model:
  - Plain C/C++ implementation without dependencies
  - Apple silicon first-class citizen - optimized via Arm Neon and Accelerate framework
  - AVX intrinsics support for x86 architectures
  - Mixed F16 / F32 precision
  - Low memory usage (Flash Attention + Flash Forward)
  - Zero memory allocations at runtime
  - Runs on the CPU
  - C-style API
- Whisper.cpp small model is best traadeoff of performance vs accuracy https://blog.lopp.net/open-source-transcription-software-comparisons/
- whisper openai api https://twitter.com/calumbirdo/status/1614826199527690240?s=46&t=-lurfKb2OVOpdzSMz0juIw

-  https://whispermemos.com pressing button on my Lock Screen and getting a perfect transcription in my inbox.
- whisper on AWS - the g4dn machines are the sweet spot of price/performance.
- https://simonsaysai.com to generate subtitles and they had the functionality to input specialized vocabulary,
- https://skyscraper.ai/ using assemblyai
- Read.ai - https://www.read.ai/transcription Provides transcription & diarization and the bot integrates into your calendar. It joins all your meetings for zoom, teams, meet, webex, tracks talk time, gives recommendations, etc.
	- https://huggingface.co/spaces/vumichien/whisper-speaker-diarization This space uses Whisper models from [**OpenAI**](https://github.com/openai/whisper) to recoginze the speech and ECAPA-TDNN model from [**SpeechBrain**](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) to encode and clasify speakers

- Teleprompter
	- https://github.com/danielgross/teleprompter
		- Everything happens privately on your computer. In order to achieve fast latency locally, we use embeddings or a small fine-tuned model.
		- The data is from Kaggle's quotes database, and the embeddings were computed using SentenceTransformer, which then runs locally on ASR. I also finetuned a small T5 model that sorta works (but goes crazy a lot).

This allows for one to do text-to-audio or TTS, not offered in the paper.
