# SD RESOURCE GOLDMINE

## Character Limit Hit, Move here for the next Version, This Will no Longer Be Updated: https://rentry.org/sdupdates2

!!! danger Warnings: 

	1. Ckpts/hypernetworks/embeddings are ==not== interently safe as of right now. They can be pickled/contain malicious code. Use your common sense and protect yourself as you would with any random download link you would see on the internet.

	2. Monitor your GPU temps and increase cooling and/or undervolt them if you need to. There have been claims of GPU issues due to high temps.

!!! Links are dying. If you happen to have a file listed in https://rentry.org/sdupdates#deadmissing or that's not on this list, please get it to me.

!!! info There is now a github for this rentry: https://github.com/questianon/sdupdates. This should allow you to see changes across the different updates. There is also a WIP embedding directory here: https://github.com/questianon/sdupdates/wiki

!!! note If you know how to do stuff in markdown and html/can make a webpage easily/want to contribute in any way, contact me

## NEWSFEED

!!! note Don't forget to git pull to get a lot of new optimizations + updates, if SD breaks go backward in commits until it starts working again  
	Instructions:  
	* If on Windows:  
		1. go to the webui directory  
		2. ```git pull```  
		3. ```pip -r install requirements.txt```  
	* If on Linux:  
		1. go to the webui directory  
		2. ```source ./venv/bin/activate```  
			a. if this doesn't work, run ```python -m venv venv``` beforehand  
		3. ```git pull```  
		4. ```pip -r install requirements.txt```

> train multiple denoisers, use one for the starting few steps to form rough shapes, use one for the last few steps to finalize detail  
> while training, use a image classifier to mark regions corresponding to subjects in the text descriptor. If text descriptor doesn't exist, add it to the prompt  
> modify attention function to increase the attention weight between subjects found by the classifier  
> modify loss function to give regions marked by the classifier more weight

	* Have xformers enabled.

	> This diff does 2 things.
	> 1. enables cross attention optimizations during TI training. Voldy disabled the optimizations during training because he said it gave him bad results. However, if you use the InvokeAI optimization or xformers after the xformers fix it does not give you bad results anymore.  
	> This saves around 1.5GB vram with xformers
>
	>2. unloads vae from VRAM during training. This is done in hypernetworks, and idk why it wasn't in the code for TI. It doesn't break anything and doesn't make anything worse.
	>This saves around .2 GB VRAM

Inpaint guide: https://archived.moe/h/thread/6930399/#6930453

> Anon:  
> By request, a very quick inpainting guide:
> 
> The key to good inpainting is understanding how "Inpaint at full resolution" actually works. The linked guides are obsolete and old at this. So I will tell you.
> 
> Inpaint at full resolution first determines the minimum rectangular box that fits all your mask. Then, it resizes the base image within that box into whatever your setting is for resolution. Note that when inpainting at full resolution, the resolution sliders determine THIS INPAINTING SPACE. In other words, you can inpaint for a 2048 by 2048 pixel image while having your sliders set for 256 by 256 pixels. There are some bugs with inpainting at full resolution with height > width https://pythontechworld.com/issue/automatic1111/stable-diffusion-webui/2524 so my recommendation is to just set it to 512 by 512 always.
> 
> Next, whatever is in your base image that would fit into the bounding box is rescaled and put into the inpainting space whose size is determined by your height and width sliders.
> 
> The padding for full resolution inpainting option ADDS ADDITIONAL PIXELS FROM THE BASE IMAGE TO YOUR BOUNDING BOX. It is extremely important to set this correctly. Essentially, it adds surrounding context from BEYOND your bounding box to the inpainting space. It MUST be set to a nonzero value if you want to match anything not interior to your mask. Set it very high if you want high context. The total input to the inpainting space is your window.
> 
> Next, what happens is essentially an img2img transformation on your window: which is the scaled image taken from the mask + original image bounding box. Set your prompts accordingly! Close-up is a very valuable tag to use in inpainting. Don't include prompts that are only relevant outside your window. DO include prompts that can determine composition within your window EVEN IF THEY AREN'T IN YOUR INPAINTING MASK. 

Krita guide by anon:

1. Get  
	https://krita.org/en/  
	https://github.com/Interpause/auto-sd-krita/wiki/Quick-Switch-Using-Existing-AUTOMATIC1111-Install  
	https://github.com/Interpause/auto-sd-krita/wiki/Install-Guide#plugin-installation
2. then you can run prompts in th app or pull one in then to inpaint like a boss, you add a new layer  
	https://files.catbox.moe/xy6z32.png
3. then use a white brush to brush the bits you want to change  
	https://files.catbox.moe/esdqk7.png
4. Turn off the layer off by hitting the eye icon but leave it selected  
	https://files.catbox.moe/wzaiw9.png
5. if you set everythign up right you have this section  
	https://files.catbox.moe/n43yrh.png
6. type what your after hit inpaint

**Positive:**  
Biggest tip: just write what you want. the AI will generally understand and create it

* NAI's default (generally good) positive prompts to add at the beginning of all prompts: masterpiece, best quality

	* can swap best for highest, high, etc.

* Group the things that you want that are similar together (e.g. things relating to body type, things relating to clothing, etc.), and put these groups in order of most important to least important

	* Anon's order: 

	> the picture's quality  
	> the picture's subject  
	> their physical appearance  
	> their emotion  
	> their clothing  
	> their pose  
	> the picture's setting

* "Anime screencap" creates scenes from an anime

* from anon: to use character (franchise/series/show/etc.), you have to format it as character \\(franchise\\) 

* the tokenizer struggles to parse underscores, ymmv

* img2img -> prompt gets you more consistency

**Negative:**

* NAI's default (remove "nsfw" if you want nsfw outputs): nsfw, lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry

**1:1 NAI/Novel AI Cheatsheet:**

* 1:1 NAI cheatsheet by anon: 

	* Use unpruned/full model

	* Load with ema weights (use .yaml config from base stable-diffusion, set use_ema to true) (minor)

		* Doubles ram

		* Anon: "I copied the one from this path (which is what voldy defaults to if one isn't specified):  
/repositories/stable-diffusion/configs/stable-diffusion/v1-inference.yaml

			And then on line 18 I set use_ema to True, and put that copy into the models folder with the correct name (name of model.yaml)."

	* CLIP layer = 2

	* Reset sigma noise / strength to the default value of 1 (no need to use 0.69 / 0.67)

	* Set eta noise seed delta to 31337

	* If using Euler a, eta noise seed delta = 31337

	* If prompt has weights, manually adjust the weight accordingly (voldy uses 1.1, NAI uses 1.05)

	* Use --no-half argument (minor)

**Tips to find a good img**

> anon: like i mentioned before, if using a non-ancestral sampler such as euler that trends to converge on the same image after a bunch of steps, you can roll seeds with 20 or less steps and very small resolution, then stop when you find a good seed and generate again with higher quality. saves scads of time when trying to make some really complicated 125 token prompt
> 
> so get a good image first with 512 rerolls  
> use the same seed but now with highres enabled

**Anon's best output settings**  
[txt2img]

Positive: none  
Negative: lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts,signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name, 3 legs, 3 arms  
Sampling Steps - 47/51  
Euler a  
Width -  512 normal/768 2 characters or better landscapes  
Height - 512 normal/768 full body  
CFG Scale: 12/12,5/18

[img2img]

Positive: complete image/none  
Negative: lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts,signature, watermark, username, blurry, artist name, 3 legs, weird  
Sampling Steps - 51  
Euler a  
Width -  512 normal/768 2 characters or better landscapes  
Height - 512 normal/768 full body  
CFG Scale: 18  
Denoising strength: 0,5/0,68

**Lazy Prompting**

> go to *booru of your choice  
> pick an image you really like  
> click tags -> plain editor  
> copypaste to prompt  
> profit

**Anon's Refinement Technique:**

1. generate a picture with the prompt that you want, be very precise. I personally generate pictures that are 512x512 initially.
2. once you get a decent picture to come out of the generation, it will be used as the base "sketch" to feed to img2img.
3. if you want to, increase the resolution but if you do so set the denoising to about .60
4. once you have the resolution you want and everything, keep reprocessing the image with a denoising of about 0.2 - 0.3.
5. if something on the image bothers you, work on it in an image editor, for example using a brush of the same colour of the what's adjacent to the detail you want to remove, or if you want to add something (like refining fingers), make sure to use the pencil with a contrasted colour (I generally use black).
6. after editing, always reprocess the image with a denoising of about 0.3
7. once the result satisfies you enough, use the "R-ESRGAN 4x+ Anime6B" upscaler if you want the image upscaled.

Rentry: https://rentry.org/berrymix

> Make sure you have all the models needed, Novel Ai, Stable Diffusion 1.4, Zeipher F111, and r34_e4. All but Novel Ai can be downloaded from HERE  
> Open the Checkpoint Merger tab in the web ui  
> Set the Primary Model (A) to Novel Ai  
> Set the Secondary Model (B) to Zeipher F111  
> Set the Tertiary Model (C) to Stable Diffusion 1.4  
> Enter in a name that you will recognize  
> Set the Multiplier (M) slider all the way to the right, at "1"  
> Select "Add Difference"  
> Click "Run" and wait for the process to complete  
> Now set the Primary Model (A) to the new checkpoint you just made (Close the cmd and restart the webui, then refresh the web page if you have issues with the new checkpoint not being an option in the drop down)  
> Set the Secondary Model (B) to r34_e4  
> Ignore Tertiary Model (C) (I've tested it, it wont change anything)  
> Enter in the name of the final mix, something like "Berry's Mix" ;)  
> Set Multiplier (M) to "0.25"  
> Select "Weighted Sum"  
> Click "Run" and wait for the process to complete  
> Restart the Web Ui and reload the page just to be safe  
> At the top left of the web page click the "Stable Diffusion Checkpoint" drop down and select the Berry's Mix.ckpt (or whatever you named it) it should have the hash "[c7d3154b]"

	* Author's notes: Smut version was trained on a lot of doujins and it looks more like her old style from the start of smut version of Ane doujin (compare to chapter 1 and you can see that it worked). 200k version is looking a bit more like her recent style but I can see it isn't going to work the way I hoped. 

	* By accident I started with 70 pics where half of them were doujins to give reference for smut. Complete data is 200 with again those same 35 doujins for smut. I realized that I used half smut instead of full set so I went back to around 40k steps and then gave it complete 200 picture set hoping it would course correct since non smut is more recent art style. Now it looks like it didn't course correct and will never do that. On the other hand recent iterations are less horny.

		-eyelashes not as thick as before, probably because i used more pre-2022 pictures. actually bit sad about it, but w/e  
		-eyes in general look better, i recommend generating on 768×768 with highres fix  
		-blonde hair got a pink gradient for some reason  
		-tends to hide dicks between the breasts more often, but does it noticeably better  
		-likes to add backgrounds, i think i overcooked it a bit so those look more like artifacts, perhaps with other prompts it will look better  
		-less hags  
		-from my test prompts, it looked like it breaks anatomy less often now, but i mostly tested pov paizuri  
		-became kinda worse at non-paizuri pictures, less sharpness. because of that, i'm also including 60000 steps version, which is slightly better at that, but in the end, it's a matter of preference, whether to use newer version or not: https://files.catbox.moe/1zt65u.pt

* Raichiyo33 style hypernetwork. Not perfect but seems good enough.

	> Trained with captions from booru tags for compability with model + art by raichiyo33 in the beginning over NAI model.  Use "art by raichiyo33" in the begining of prompt to triggering.  
	> Some useful tips: 
	> 1) with tag "traditional media" produce more beautiful results
	> 2) try to avoid too much negativ promts. I use only "bad anatomy, bad hands, lowres, worst quality, low quality, blurry, bad quality" even that seems too much. With many UC tags (especially with full NAI set of uc) it will produce almost generic NAI result. 
	> 3) Use CLIP -2 (because its trained over NAI, ofc)

Then you can use M1 to set how many epochs of the most recent data you want to use for the red trendline (green is the same length but starting before red). Outlayer % is if you want to filter out extreme points 100% means all points are considered for trendline 95% filters out top and bottom 5 etc. Basically you can use this to see where the training started fucking up.

> Max Steps: 100,000

* Anon's Guide: 

1. Having good text tags on the images is rather important. This means laboriously going through and adding tags to the BLIP tags and editing the BLIP tags as well, and often manually describing the image. Fortunately my dataset had only like…30 images total, so I was able to knock it out pretty quick, but I can imagine it being completely obnoxious for a 500 image gallery. Although I guess you could argue that strict prompt accuracy becomes less important as you have more training examples. Again, if they would just add an automatic deepdanbooru option alongside the BLIP for preprocessing that would take away 99% of the work.

2. Vectors. Honestly I started out making my embedding at 8, it was shit. 16, still shit but better. 20, pretty good, and I was like fuck it let's go to 50 and that was even better still. IDK. I don't think you can go much higher though if you want to use your tag anyway where but the very beginning of a 75 token block. I had heard that having more tokens = needing more images and also overfitting but I did not find this to be the case.

3. The other major thing I needed to do is make a character.txt for textual inversion. For whatever reason, the textual inversion templates literally have NO character/costume template. The closest thing is subject which is very far off and very bad. Thus, I had to write my own: https://files.catbox.moe/wbat5x.txt

4. Yeah for whatever reason the VAE completely fries and fucks up any embedding training and you can only find this from reading comments on 4chan or in the issues list of the github. The unload VAE when training DOES NOT WORK for textual embedding. Again, I don't know why. Thus it is absolutely 100% stone cold essential to rename or move your vae then relaunch everything before you do any textual inversion training. Don't forget to put it back afterwards (and relaunch again) because without the VAE everything is a blurry mess and faces and like sloth from the goonies.

So all told, this is the process:

1. Get a dataset of images together. Use the preprocess tab and the BLIP and the split and flip and all that.

2. Laboriously go through EVERY SINGLE IMAGE YOU JUST MADE while simultaneously looking at their text file BLIP descriptions and updating them with the booru tags or deepdanbooru tags (which you have to have manually gotten ahead of time if you want them), and making sure the BLIP caption is at least roughly correct, and deleting any image which doesn't feature your character after the cropping operation if it was too big. EVERY. SINGLE. IMAGE. OAJRPIOANJROPIanrpianfrpianra

3. Now that the hard parts over, just make your embedding using the make embedding page. Choose some vector amount (I mean I did good with 50 whatever), set girl as your initialization or whatever's appropriate.

4. Go to train page and get training. Everything on the page is pretty self explanatory. I used 5e-02:2000, 5e-03:4000, 5e-04:6000, 5e-05 for the learning rate schedule but you can fool around. Make sure the prompt template file is pointed at an appropriate template file for what you're trying to do like the character one I made, and then just train. Honestly, it shouldn't take more than 10k steps which goes by pretty quick even with batch size 1.

OH and btw, obviously use https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl to scrape your image dataset from whichever boorus you like. Don't forget the --write-tags flag!

Vector guide by anon:  
Think of vectors per token as the number of individual traits the ai will associate with your embedding. For something like "coffee cup", this is going to be pretty low generally, like 1-4. For something more like an artist's style, you're going to want it to be higher, like 12-24. You could go for more, but you're really eating into your token budget on prompts then.

Its also worth noting, the higher the count, the more images and more varied images you're going to want.

You want the ai to find things that are consistent thematics in your image. If you use a small sample size, and all your images just happen to have girls in a bikini, or all with blonde hair, that trait might get attributed to your prompt, and suddenly "coffee cup" always turns out blonde girls in bikinis too.

**How do I get more of a strong effect on my embedding?**

> (might be outdated info) Embeddings take your image and find tokens from the current model that match the image, and when you use the embedding, it called on those specific tokens. So, it really depends on what embedding you're trying to create (how close it is to the default model, how pronounced the imgs are, etc). Plus, you can always add more emphasis for more of an effect

**How does the increasing prompt token limit work?**

> With the token counter for each word, let's say you have the prompt:
> 
> girl (1), blue (2),…, apple (74), banana (75), orange (76), kiwi (77)
> 
> The prompt would split after banana because banana consists of 1 token and the weights would reset to start from strong again. So it's basically like
> 
> girl (1), blue (2),…, apple (74), banana (75) AND orange (1), kiwi (2)

**What is a vae?**

> Check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variational_autoencoder  
> TLDR: a filter that changes output

**What is dreambooth?**

* Read this for info: https://dreambooth.github.io/

**What is difference merging/why is there a way to merge three models?**

> The first two models are merged using standard interpolation. The third model is for a difference merge. 

* For models A, B, and C:

	* The formula is A + (B - C) * (1 - M), where

		* A is the model where the learning is going to be transfered

		* B is the model that has been finetuned (trained) on a certain object

		* C is the base model that was used to finetune B

		* B-C is difference between B and C, which is added to A

		* (1-M) is the multiplier > how much of the difference to add to A

			* (1-M) is in the slider in the UI, where the slider being on the right makes (1-M) = 1

**How would distributed training work?**

> According to NeonTheCoder: "well a model trained ontop of another would be the same, plus added data, and slided data.  
> if you subtract the original from that you should be left with the difference, and the new data.  
> then if you add that ontop of another model, it should only be adding the difference it made from original SD to the target model, and the new data"

> Basically: You train a model, subtract the original model so you only have the "trainings", then add the trainings to aonther model. This means you can delegate training tasks to different people and add up all the results.

**What GPU should I buy?**

> Refer to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zlv4UFiciSgmJZncCujuXKHwc4BcxbjbSBg71-SdeNk/. Generally, higher VRAM is better.

**What does Stability AI's "no nudity" for their SFW model mean for us?**

> It's only speculation, but probably a loss in accurate anatomy and overall NSFW stuff. We can always train NSFW into the released model, though the quality will probably be worse than if Stability AI did it (thousands/millions of images vs billions of images).

**What's the difference between an embedding and a hypernetwork?**

> By anon: Embeddings add new tokens to the vocabulary but leave the model unchanged, hypernet alters the behavior of the network itself within the layers - hypernet has a lot more capacity to change the behavior but you can obviously only have one active at once

**Why does my output differ from someone else's output?**

> Check to see if your settings match theirs. Also, using an optimization such as lowvram, medvram, and xformers will cause variations in outputs.

> Hi-res generations are affected by the video card used  
	* https://desuarchive.org/g/thread/89259005/#89260871

**Why do I keep getting/how do I fix a black output when using .vae with the NAI model?**

> Using --no-half-vae will fix the random black images when using the .vae

**How do you add upscalers?**

> Put the files into stable-diffusion-webui/models/ESRGAN or GFPGAN, it should say on https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database

**How do you add embeddings?**

> Make a folder in your webui install (next to webui-user.bat) named embeddings > put your .pt and .bin embedding files here

**Why are my faces blurry/messed up/ugly/deformed/etc.?**

> This could be because of a variety of things. Generally, to fix this, try generating at a higher resolution, using hi-res fix, inpainting your face normally, inpainting your face at full resolution, editing a good face on top of your face and img2img-ing, adding pretty face (or some variant) to the positive prompt and ugly face (or some variant) to the negative prompt, and making the ai focus more on the face with a closer shot (e.g. "portrait shot").

**What is textual inversion?**

> Textual inversion makes the ai brute forces tags that it thinks matches your imgs and creates an embedding. Doing this on a subject in many situations (e.g. different environments and poses) generally allows the AI to create better embedding

**Stuff doesn't work/is outdated!**

> Git pull or do a fresh install by git cloning into another folder. You can also git reset --hard [commit id], but be careful of overwriting your outputs/embeddings/models

**What is ENSD?**

> ENSD is eta noise seed delta (in the settings). It shifts your seed and does some eta/sigma stuff. NAI uses 31337

**Is the leaked NAI model safe?**

> The risk isn't 0, but there hasn't been any reports of getting hacked/pickled yet. Only you can decide if it's safe enough for you to use.

**Is anything here safe??**

> Similarly, the risk isn't 0, but no one has gotten hacked from any links here as far I ask know.

**Help! I need a prompt and I don't know where to start**

> Find a prompt someone else used and repurpose it for yourself. Think if what you like and just start writing tags/descriptions. If you need a tag but don't know the Danbooru equivalent, you can usually find it by searching danbooru [write what tag you want here]

**How do I make better pictures?**

> For a general workflow:

1. paint something really crude, it can literally be blobs of color
2. img2img with a prompt
3. edit original img or prompt or output input
4. reimg2img/inpaint
5. repeat last few steps until you get what you want

> Step 1 can be replaced with just starting with a txt2img if you want the AI to decide for you

**What is no-half and full precision?**

> Most new GPUs will use half precision since it lowers VRAM. Only use no-half and/or full-precision if you want to get the absolute best quality (minor difference) or if you are running a 16xx card.

**How to inpaint?**

* Good guide: https://rentry.org/drfar

* TLDR: Mask > describe ONLY the part you're inpainting > generate

**Why doesn't inpainting work?**

* Try running in incognito/private browsing mode, adblockers and certain plugins/extensions break inpainting

* Try refreshing/restarting the webui

**How do you get NAI (NovelAI) 1:1?**

> Refer to https://rentry.org/sdupdates#prompting

**Does order of prompts matter?**

> Yes, the order = priority that the AI will put in your img

**How do I setup NAIFU?**

> Read the text file that tells you how to in the download

> By anon: (Windows):

1) Make sure you install Python and check "Add Python to PATH": https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/

2) Download the naifu torrent from this link:https://rentry.org/sdg_FAQ#naifu-novelai-model-backend-frontend.

3) Inside of the naifu folder, right click program.zip and click "extract here" with 7zip or WinRAR.

4) Run setup.bat and let it finish.

5) Run run.bat and once it's running, open a new browser window/tab and make sure that you type in http://localhost:6969/ into the address bar.

6) Bada bing bada boom you should have the site running locally on your PC.

**What upscaler should I use?**

> I recommend SD Upscaler, it adds details as well as upscales. For a while LSDR was regarded as the best, this might've changed though. Some anons like swinir, some like esrgan4x, ymmv

**How do I know if X is loaded?**

> Ususally, the console will tell you. It will not tell you if hypernetworks or v2.pt is loaded

**How do I update?**

> open command prompt in auto's folder and type "git pull". Or, right click in the folder, git bash here, git pull. To make sure you have the requirements, run "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the same fashion.

**Recommended Settings (need to update this)?**

* default NAI negatives: nsfw, lowres, bad anatomy, bad hands, text, error, missing fingers, extra digit, fewer digits, cropped, worst quality, low quality, normal quality, jpeg artifacts, signature, watermark, username, blurry

	* Supposedly adding "artist name" into here improves results

* Prefix all prompts with masterpiece, best quality

	* Apparently NAI adds another hidden "masterpiece" after "best quality", but this might've been debunked already

> For non-NAI models: Clip skip 0, everything else is good (afaik don't use hypernetworks, v2, yaml, VAE)

**What are (parentheses), [brackets], {this thing}, <>, and decimals?**

> () is more emphasis, [] is less emphasis, {} is NAI's "implementation" of (), <> is for embeddings, decimals specify the number of ()'s so you don't need to type in a bunch.

> (boobs) would have more weight than [boobs] in the final result, (boobs:1.4) would increase the boobage by ~40% more than what they would've normally been, (boobs:0.6) will decrease it by ~40%.  
	If using multiple (parenthesis) instead of decimals, is changed by a multiplier of 1.1 with each new parenthesis  
	> (n) = (n:1.1)  
	> ((n)) = (n:1.21)  
	> (((n))) = (n:1.331)  
	> ((((n)))) = (n:1.4641)  
	> (((((n)))) = (n:1.61051)  
	> ((((((n)))))) = (n:1.771561)

	[n] = (n:0.9090909090909091)
	[[n]] = (n:0.8264462809917355)
	[[[n]]] = (n:0.7513148009015778)
	[[[[n]]]] = (n:0.6830134553650707)
	[[[[[n]]]]] = (n:0.6209213230591552)
	[[[[[[n]]]]]] = (n:0.5644739300537775) 

> ([prompt]:[number less than 1]) = [using this syntax]  
	* I don't think decimals work with this syntax, it's undocumented in AUTOMATIC's wiki

> 2 of {} = 1 of (), accurate with a difference of <1%

> by anon: exceeding 3x () or [] is less predictable and can overcook your prompt

**How do you escape/use () for series names (or whatever is in () that isn't supposed to be weighted) in prompts?**

* https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features#prompt-editing

* character \\(franchise\\)

**What is prompt editing?**

* https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/wiki/Features#prompt-editing

* Follows the format of [P1:P2:[step # to change from P1 to P2]]

	* Good for creating a base with P1 and adding details with P2

* Loads one prompt for x steps, then runs the next prompt

* If the number is between 0 and 1, it's a fraction (percentage) of the number of steps after which to make the switch. If it's an integer greater than zero, it's just the step after which to make the switch.

	* Example: The prompt is "a [fantasy:cyberpunk:16] landscape"  
    The model will draw a fantasy landscape for 16 steps. After step 16, it will switch to drawing a cyberpunk landscape

**What is AND?**

> AND combines prompts together:

> A good metaphor to remember when prompting: P1 AND P2 AND P3 for 10 steps = P1 step 1, P2 step 2, P3 step 3, P1 step 4, etc… P1 step 10. It's good for combining two different prompts together, such as a background prompt and a subject prompt. 

> By kind anon: each prompt creates a "guidance" vector saying how to change the image to "match" the prompt, whatever that is, and AND makes you have TWO prompts pulling the image in different directions (that get added together)

> Technical: https://energy-based-model.github.io/Compositional-Visual-Generation-with-Composable-Diffusion-Models/

**What are negative prompts?**

> By kind anon: this is also how negative prompts work-- it computes how to change the image to go towards the negative prompt, and SUBTRACTS that to move away from it

**What are positive prompts?**

* Positive prompts calculate how much each step should move toward the positive prompt. Adding weights increases how much towards (or past) the positive prompt the AI will travel

**What's my best option if I want to imitate a specific artstyle?**

> You could try finding someone similar, doing textual inversion, or describing the artsyle (eg thick stroke, lineart, etc.)

**What are hypernetworks, VAE, v2.pt, etc? **

> Hypernetworks are like styles for your generation

> VAE's fix faces and eyes, is generally good, but seems to dull colors
> * Disable if training

> v2.pt censors and generally changes the whole composition. a lot of people don't like it

> yaml doesn't seem to do anything except double ram usage

**What is Deep Danbooru?**

> Deep Danbooru is an autotagger. The AI automatically finds Danbooru tags that it thinks matches the picture it's given. To activate it

1. git pull, edit webui-user.bat
2. add the --deepdanbooru argument to webui-user.bat so it looks like COMMANDLINE_ARGS=--deepdanbooru
3. find the interrogation change in img2img.

**How do I get NAIFU to automatically save images for me?**

> Edit run.bat. Ctrl + f to "export SAVE_files". Remove the "::" and change the word from export to set.

**How do you load the VAE?**

> Rename it to [your model's name here].vae.pt and put it next to your model in the models/Stable-diffusion folder

**How do you load hypernetworks?/How do you use hypernetworks?**

> create a hypernetworks folder in the models folder and place all the .pt files there

**How do you load the v2.pt?**

> place the v2.pt in the same folder as your webui-user.bat file (the root folder) and add https://rentry.org/nai-prior-v2 into your scripts folder (rename the text file to [anything].py

**How do you load the yaml?**

> It's not recommended to load the yaml because it doubles ram for no change in output, but if you really want to, rename it to [model name].yaml and place it next to your model.
> 
> Asukaimguranon: I will report that the yaml didn't double my vram usage outright, but i experienced something like a memory leak because it oom crashed after a dozen gens at most (compared to non-yaml for hundreds of gens no problem). the gens i did get matched non-yaml 1:1 so there's basically no reason to use yaml ever.

**What are wildcards?**

> by anon: wildcard just lets you create a text file with a list of prompt words, and then you reference that text file to randomly pick from it, so you could randomize hair color, or pose, specific character, etc

**Where do you get wildcards?**

> Got this info from a kind anon in hdg: Search archive or git for wildcard pastebin and copy what you want. Then, download wildcards.py from AUTOMATIC1111's wiki. Place script + pastebin text files (which are in a folder named wildcards, the text files are named [wildcard name here].txt) in /scripts. Activate wildcards in AUTO's gui. In a prompt, you would write **[wildcard name here]** to choose a random name from that txt file. To use weights: (**[wildcards name here]**:[weight amount]) 

* Example wildcards: https://github.com/jtkelm2/stable-diffusion-webui-1/tree/master/scripts/wildcards

* Dump: check links

**What is interpolation when merging models?**

> It determines how much of each model is in the output model. if number is 40 for linear: 40% primary, 60% secondary. If number is 40 for sigmoid or inverse sig, this percent is weighted according to the graphs. sigmoid: primary checkpoint gets less weight than if using weighted sum. inverse sigmoid: opposite to sigmoid

## Confirmed Drama

10/20 News

TLDR from reddit:

* RunwayML releases the v1.5 model on their repo

* Copyright takedown notice from StabilityAI

* RunwayML CEO releases a slightly passive agressive message reminding that they have the right to release the model, which was created by a RunwayML Researcher and a University researcher. "Thanks" StabilityAI for the offered processing power

* Emad (StabilityAI) responds on the Discord stating the copyright takedown notice was just a mistake. He states they have never prevented the release of a model, and they just want to make sure Stable Diffusion doesn't face legal issues. No word on the disagreement in itself, but it seems to imply that RunwayML disagreed on the way StabilityAI wanted to navigate the legal issues, and decided to just release the model.

* TLDR: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y99yb1/a_summary_of_the_most_recent_shortlived_so_far/

* Takedown notice: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y969ph/model_15_legal_investigation_and_takedown_warning/

* CEO Statement: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y97ya0/official_response_on_sd_15_model_by_chris_at/

anon's recap: 

> we are so open guys, we have a clause in our employee contracts stating that they have the right to release any model they work on  
> we've never stopped developers from releasing models btw  
> we didn't issue a takedown request btw  
> well ok, we did issue a takedown request, but it wasn't a LEGAL request ok?  
> there was no leak btw guys everything is fine haha folk get so riled up!  
> one of the lead researchers of the model leaked OUR model, what a pathetic publicity stunt!

**Quick Rundown:**

> emad confirming censorship for 1.5, no more porn  
Might cause anatomical issues in released model. Non-issue for NSFW though, especially with model merging

Debunked, SD will probably release a SFW model before their 1.5 model because of legal issues

> drama between emad and automatic1111  
Emad issued a private and public apology over it  
AUTOMATIC v. StabilityAI:

* Summary: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y1uuvj/automatic1111_did_nothing_wrong_some_people_are/

* Funny, not sure if real, apparently it is: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/discussions/2509

* Control given back to community: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y1nc7t/rstablediffusion_should_be_independent_and_run_by/

* Mod's story: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y19kdh/mod_here_my_side_of_the_story/

* by anon: I think [StabilityAI] backpedaled a bit, offered to unban automatic. Offered to give control of community places back to the community.

* automatic1111's repo removed from pinned guide on r/stablediffusion

* all old mods on stable diffusion subreddit kicked and replaced by stabilityai members. Big discourse on corruption and true open-source training

Emad will supposedly **not** censor the expected Stability AI model release since SAI are only training their SFW model

* Conversation from AMA:

> > User: is it a risk the new models (v1.X, v2, v3, vX) to be released only on dreamstudio or for B2B(2C)? what can we do to help you on this?
> > 
> > Emad: basically releasing NSFW models is hard right now Emad: SFW models are training
> > 
> > User: could you also detail in more concrete terms what the "extreme edge cases" are to do with the delay in 1.5? i assume it's not all nudity in that case, just things that might cause legal concern?
> > 
> > Emad: Sigh, what type of image if created from a vanilla model (ie out of the box) could cause legal troubles for all involved and destroy all this. I do not want to say what it is and will not confirm for Reasons but you should be able to guess.
> > 
> > User: what is the practical difference between your SFW and NSFW models? just filtering of the dataset? if so, where is the line drawn -- all nudity and violence? as i understand it, the dataset used for 1.4 did not have so much NSFW material to start with, apart from artsy nudes
> > 
> > Emad: nudity really. Not sure violence is NSFW

By the question asker:

> just want to clarify a misunderstanding that seems to have taken hold to do with 1.5 censorship  
> i was the person asking emad about the clarifications about "extreme edge cases" and the difference between their NSFW and SFW models  
> the context of that question was emad was speaking about how SFW models are easier to release right now because of potential legal issues with the NSFW models, and about training a separate set of SFW models  
> the "extreme edge cases" question was about 1.5 specifically; as far as i understood it, 1.5 is one of their NSFW models and the "extreme edge cases" that they want to censor are cp, not all nudity  
> the "SFW vs NSFW" question was about the distinction between two category of models that emad was referring to, the SFW models are separate and trained with most (all?) nsfw content filtered from the dataset, but not violence  
> ![Emad](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031903589850959882/1031906934779019264/unknown.png)  
> of course i'm not trying to shill for them or anything, and we'll see the true extent of the censorship if/when they release the models, but at the very least this is what was actually said

## Unconfirmed Drama

Quick Rundown:

> drama around models supposedly trained on CP
> 
> > Don't download every random model link you come across

Whether the fed bait is an actual fed bait or not cannot be confirmed

Some anons theorize that the fed bait wasn't due to the ckpt but was due to glowie anon's scraper downloading actual CP from a torrent somewhere using a DHT search engine

An anon claims to have tested the fed bait and said that the output a worse version of another existing model. Whether this is true or not cannot be confirmed

Another anon's theory: "if he truly did get his acct taken down, he mentioned auto-scraping torrents, then it's possible the fed did have a honeypot or tracking on that particular torrent (but they didn't make the content), that seems the most likely to me. if this was all a hoax to spread panic about a particular torrent, he chose a relatively unknown torrent to do it with, for example it would be explosive if he made these accusations about the original novelai torrent. he may be telling the truth, but he hasn't provided strong evidence backing up the full story, so there are a lot of grains of salt to be taken"

## Fed Bait Information

> Editor's note: I shortened the fed bait PSA because it was not officially confirmed by sources other than by the owner of SD training and the 4channer who got baited. It also took up too much space at the top. The fed bait info was a huge dump in the first place because it was a copy paste of the announcement from the SD training server and I got confirmation from the owner of SD training, and, if the announcement was true, it was a relevant and timely warning to delete/avoid downloading the pickle model. Even if this whole thing turns out to be a huge troll by both the owner and the 4channer, this situation showcases the danger of downloading random files from the internet. 

> Given the severity of the situation, the fed bait warning will stay a PSA (for now) to keep people wary of random ckpts/pts/vaes they download.

> That being said, future drama on this rentry will be confirmed by multiple sources before being posted at the top. For the unconfirmed drama, refer to https://rentry.org/sdupdates#unconfirmed-drama. 

TLDR: fed allegedly uploaded ckpt of CP as a honeypot, anon downloaded it and got a warning from their seedbox who got a warning from Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command

!!! danger There are claims of a model trained on CP in the wild

	It is alleged that these models were distributed by feds via torrents starting around October 11, 2022.

Original fed post: ![original fed post](https://is2.4chan.org/g/1665809595734276.png) 

Anon's statement: "one of our users was auto-scrapping every CKPT file on every tracker (pseudo) and they stumbled upon it, it had a weird name that literally nobody knew about until he searched on the 4chan archives and found what it was abt (pic related). then ofc he deleted it, and just a few minutes ago he told me he got a letter on his email from his seed box and it was abt "containing materials created and containing with sufficiently sexually suggestive images of minors" and it seems it was a fed bait"
