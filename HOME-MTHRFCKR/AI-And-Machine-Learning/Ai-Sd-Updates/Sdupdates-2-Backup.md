# SD RESOURCE GOLDMINE 2

->Version 2 of https://www.rentry.org/sdupdates. If something you want isn't here, it's probably in the other rentry<-

!!! danger Warnings: 

	1. Ckpts/hypernetworks/embeddings are ==not== interently safe as of right now. They can be pickled/contain malicious code. Use your common sense and protect yourself as you would with any random download link you would see on the internet.

	2. Monitor your GPU temps and increase cooling and/or undervolt them if you need to. There have been claims of GPU issues due to high temps.

!!! Links are dying. If you happen to have a file listed in https://rentry.org/sdupdates#deadmissing or that's not on this list, please get it to me.

!!! info There is now a github for this rentry: https://github.com/questianon/sdupdates. This should allow you to see changes across the different updates

!!! note Changelog: everything except discord and reddit

All rentry links are ended with a '.org' here and can be changed to a '.co'. Also, use incognito/private browsing when opening google links, else you lose your anonymity / someone may dox you

# NEWSFEED

!!! note Don't forget to git pull to get a lot of new optimizations + updates, if SD breaks go backward in commits until it starts working again  
	Instructions:  
	* If on Windows:  
		1. navigate to the webui directory through command prompt or git bash  
			a. Git bash: right click > git bash here  
			b. Command prompt: click the spot in the "url" between the folder and the down arrow and type "command prompt".  
			c. If you don't know how to do this, open command prompt, type "cd [path to stable-diffusion-webui]" (you can get this by right clicking the folder in the "url" or holding shift + right clicking the stable-diffusion-webui folder)  
		2. ```git pull```  
		3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```  
	* If on Linux:  
		1. go to the webui directory  
		2. ```source ./venv/bin/activate```  
			a. if this doesn't work, run ```python -m venv venv``` beforehand  
		3. ```git pull```  
		4. ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

SDupdates the trilogy is happening soon

* WD 1.4 information:

	* New Deepdanbooru for better tagging (prerelease right now)

	* much better hands - look at 'Cafe Unofficial Instagram TEST Model Release' for a sample of what it can do in an unfinished model

	* Trained off SD 1.5

	* Creator: "In terms of general flexibility of being able to prompt a wide range of things, wd1.4 should be better than everything" (planned to supercede all current models, including NAI and anything.ckpt, to the point where you don't need to merge)

	* Creator: "we may create our own version of hypernetworks and create fine tunes for anime and realistic styles"

	* Creator: the instagram model training includes improvements such as:

		1. dynamic image aspect training (as in we trained images with ZERO cropping, the entire image is fed into SD all at once, even if it's landscape or portrait)
		2. unconditional training such that the model can somewhat self improve
		3. higher resolutions during training (640x640 max)
		4. much faster training code (6-8x performance increase)
		5. better training hyperparameters
		6. automated blip captioning of all images

	* Dataset and associated tags will be public

	* Haru and Cafe came up with a temporary plan that may be able to drastically improve the performance of clip without having to retrain clip from scratch, though it'll have to happen after wd1.4

	* to prevent bleed from the images, each source will have a tag associated with it in the caption data when fed into SD

* Intel Arc (A770) can get ~5.2 it/s right now with unoptimized SD, fp16: https://github.com/rahulunair/stable_diffusion_arc

* New latent diffusion-based upscaler by StabilityAI staff member: https://twitter.com/StabilityAI/status/1590531946026717186

	* Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o1qYJcFeywzCIdkfKJy7cTpgZTCM2EI4

* Discovered what NAI's "Variations" feature does (by enhance anon): Alright, variations is really similar to enhance. It sends it to img2img with strength hardcoded @ 0.8, and then increments the seed by 1 for each variation given. Nothing super special.

* Discovered what NAI's "Enhance" feature does (by anon): It upscales the image with Lanczos (defaults to 1.5x, which is the max), and then sends it to img2img with [whatever sampler you specified] @ 50 steps, with the denoising strength ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 (this is the "Magnitude" value that NAI shows, ranging from 1 to 5). It's like a much more expensive version of SD Upscale, which does it as tiles to save VRAM, and instead this does it on the whole image at once, so it requires more VRAM.

* Style transfer script: https://github.com/nicolai256/Few-Shot-Patch-Based-Training

* Dreambooth extension released: https://github.com/d8ahazard/sd_dreambooth_extension

	* Downloadable through the extension manager

	* Bug (anon provided): checkpoint saving per N iteration makes you OOM if you are on 12gb, if you disable that then your entire thing wont save, so you have to make the number match the maximum steps for it to save properly

* anything.ckpt (v3 6569e224; v2.1 619c23f0), a Chinese finetune/training continuation of NAI, is released: https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv19603218

			* another link that has 1 letter changed that could mean it's pickled: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r--2XuWV--MVoKKmTfyM-g

	* SDmodel owner thinks it's resumed training

	* seems to be better (e.g. provide more detailed backgrounds and characters) than NAI, but can overfry some stuff. Try lowering the cfg if that happens

	* Passes AUTOMATIC's pickle tester and https://github.com/zxix/stable-diffusion-pickle-scanner, but there's no guarantee on pickle safety, so it still might be ccp spyware

	* Use the vae or else your outputs will have a grey filter

* ddetailer released: https://github.com/dustysys/ddetailer

	* object detection and auto-mask, helpful in fixing faces without manually masking

* (didn't see this until now) Training TI on 6gb when xformers is available inplemented: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/pull/4056

* (From yesterday) Unprompted extension has ads (self-ad, not google ad) now

	* Extensions > uncheck unprompted and reload

	* There are ways to mod it to hide ads

		* Way by anon (This does not remove the ads, CSS only affects appearance. Everything going on in the background to fetch the ad before displaying it, is still happening, including potentially sending info such as your prompts): Edit style.css so it has:

			> #unprompted #toggle-ad {opacity:0.5}  
			> #unprompted #toggle-ad:hover {opacity:1;}  
			> #unprompted {margin-bottom:2em}  
			> #unprompted #ad.active {opacity:0;max-height:000px;padding:00px 00px;transition:1s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0, 0);}  
			> #unprompted #ad {transition:0.5s cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0, 0);max-height:0;overflow:hidden;opacity:0;padding:0px 00px;}

* Lots of issues with overpaying for dreambooth training: https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/ynb6h1/dont_overpay_for_dreambooth_training/

	* TLDR (from the creator of the dreambooth ui):  
		You don't need pay more than 10$ for a hosted dreambooth training.  
		Make sure you have access the trained model (ckpt) before you pay for it.

* Anon says that if you mess with k-diffusion's scheduling, you can make DPM++ 2M Karras a lot better at low steps.

``` python
workflow looks like this:
>generate square portrait (i use 1024 for this example)
>create or find driving video
>crop driving video to square with ffmpeg, making sure to match the general distance from camera and face position(it does not do well with panning/zooming video or too much head movement)
>run thin-plate-spline-motion-model
>take result.mp4 and put it into Video2x (Waifu2x Caffe)
>put into flowframes for 60fps and webm

>if you don't care about upscaling it makes 256x256 pretty easily

get ffmpeg for your OS (if you dont have ffmpeg it is good to have besides this app)

after this need to make sure ffmpeg.exe is in your PATH variable
then i typed

Inpainting a face by anon:

> send the picture to inpaint  
> modify the prompt to remove anything related to the background  
> add (face) to the prompt  
> slap a masking blob over the whole face  
> mask blur 10-16 (may have to adjust after), masked content: original, inpaint at full resolution checked, full resolution padding 0, sampling steps ~40-50, sampling method DDIM, width and height set to your original picture's full res  
> denoising strength .4-.5 if you want minor adjustments, .6-.7 if you want to really regenerate the entire masked area  
> let it rip

Some observations by anon:

1. Removing the spaces after the commas changed nothing
2. Using "best_quality" instead of "best_quality" did change the image. masterpiece,best_quality,akai haato but she is a spider,blonde hair,blue eyes
3. Changing all of the spaces into underscores changed the image somewhat substantially.
4. Replacing those commas with spaces changed the image again.

Anon's process: 

- Start with a prompt to get the general scenario you have in mind, here I was just looking to seggs the rrat so I used the embed here >>36743515 and described some of her character features to help steer the AI (in this case hair details, sharp teeth, her mouse ears and tail) as well as making her be naked and having vaginal sex
- Generate images at a default resolution size (512 by X pixels) at a relative standard number of steps (30 in this case) and keep going until I find an image thats in a position I like (in this case seed 1920052602 gave me a very nice one to work with, as you can see here https://files.catbox.moe/8z2mua.png (embed))
- Copy the seed of the image and paste it into the Seed field on the Web UI, which will maintain the composition of the image. I then double the resolution I was working with (so here I went from 512 by 768 to 1024 by 1536) and checkmark the "Hires fix option" underneath the width and height sliders. Hires fix is the secret sauce on the Web UI that helps maintain the detail of the image when you are upscaling the resolution of the image, and combined with that Upscale latent space option I mentioned earlier it really enhances the detail. With that done you can generate the upscaled image.
- Play around with the weights of the prompt tags and add things to the negatives to fix little things like hair being too red, tummy too chubby, etc. You have to be careful with adding new tags because that can drastically change the image

Anon's booba process:  
    >you can generate a perfect barbie doll anatomy but more accurate chuba in curated  
    >then switch to full, img2img it on the same seed after blotching nipples on it like a caveman, and hit generate

Boooba v2: 

1. Generate whatever NSFW proompt you were thinking of using the CURATED model, yes, I know that sounds ridiculous https://files.catbox.moe/b6k6i4.png (embed)
2. Inpaint the naughty bits back in. You REALLY don't have to do a good job of this: https://files.catbox.moe/yegjrw.png (embed)
3. Switch to Full after clicking "Save", set Strength to 0.69, Noise to 0.17, and make sure you copy/paste the same seed # back in. Hit Generate: https://files.catbox.moe/8dag88.png (embed)  
Compare that with what you'd get trying to generate the same exact proompt using the Full model purely txt2img on the same seed: https://files.catbox.moe/ytfdv3.png (embed)

# Models, Embeddings, and Hypernetworks

!!! Downloads listed as "sus" or "might be pickled" generally mean there were 0 replies and not enough "information" (like training info). or, the replies indicated they were suspicious. I don't think any of the embeds/hypernets have had their code checked so they could all be malicious, but as far as I know no one has gotten pickled yet 

!!! All files in this section (ckpt, vae, pt, hypernetwork, embedding, etc) can be malicious: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html, https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle. Make sure to check them for pickles using a tool like https://github.com/zxix/stable-diffusion-pickle-scanner

			* another link that has 1 letter changed that could mean it's pickled: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r--2XuWV--MVoKKmTfyM-g

	* seems to be better (e.g. provide more detailed backgrounds and characters) than NAI, but can overfry some stuff. Try lowering the cfg if that happens

	* Passes AUTOMATIC's pickle tester and https://github.com/zxix/stable-diffusion-pickle-scanner, but there's no guarantee on pickle safety, so it still might be ccp spyware

	* Use the vae or else your outputs will have a grey filter

	* Windows Defender might mark this as a virus, it should be a false positive

	* Supposed torrent from anon on /g/ (don't know if safe)

**Berrymix Recipe**  
Rentry: https://rentry.org/berrymix

> Make sure you have all the models needed, Novel Ai, Stable Diffusion 1.4, Zeipher F111, and r34_e4. All but Novel Ai can be downloaded from HERE  
> Open the Checkpoint Merger tab in the web ui  
> Set the Primary Model (A) to Novel Ai  
> Set the Secondary Model (B) to Zeipher F111  
> Set the Tertiary Model (C) to Stable Diffusion 1.4  
> Enter in a name that you will recognize  
> Set the Multiplier (M) slider all the way to the right, at "1"  
> Select "Add Difference"  
> Click "Run" and wait for the process to complete  
> Now set the Primary Model (A) to the new checkpoint you just made (Close the cmd and restart the webui, then refresh the web page if you have issues with the new checkpoint not being an option in the drop down)  
> Set the Secondary Model (B) to r34_e4  
> Ignore Tertiary Model (C) (I've tested it, it wont change anything)  
> Enter in the name of the final mix, something like "Berry's Mix" ;)  
> Set Multiplier (M) to "0.25"  
> Select "Weighted Sum"  
> Click "Run" and wait for the process to complete  
> Restart the Web Ui and reload the page just to be safe  
> At the top left of the web page click the "Stable Diffusion Checkpoint" drop down and select the Berry's Mix.ckpt (or whatever you named it) it should have the hash "[c7d3154b]"

	* Note: While the model can create some realistic (Japanese) Instagram-esque images on its own, for full potential, it is recommended that it be merged with another model (such as berry or anything)

	* Note: Use CLIP 2 and resolutions greater than 640x640

	* Uploader note: I was hesitant to share this one because I have been having a lot of problems with the new captioning format. With the new format essentially we have much better multiple character flexibility and outfits. You can generate 2 characters in completely separate outfits with a high percentage of no blending. However, my new captioning was causing everything to train significantly slower, so some side characters don't look as good as they did in the original 1-6 model. There is also a strict captioning format I used, so I also uploaded a prompt readme to the folder which contains all the information needed to best use this model

## **Embeddings**

!!! info If an embedding is >80mb, I mislabeled it and it's a hypernetwork

!!! info Use a download manager to download these. It saves a lot of time + good download managers will tell you if you have already downloaded one

!!! All files in this section (ckpt, vae, pt, hypernetwork, embedding, etc) can be malicious: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html, https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle. Make sure to check them for pickles using a tool like https://github.com/zxix/stable-diffusion-pickle-scanner

You can check .pts here for their training info using a text editor

	* Author's notes: Smut version was trained on a lot of doujins and it looks more like her old style from the start of smut version of Ane doujin (compare to chapter 1 and you can see that it worked). 200k version is looking a bit more like her recent style but I can see it isn't going to work the way I hoped. 

	* By accident I started with 70 pics where half of them were doujins to give reference for smut. Complete data is 200 with again those same 35 doujins for smut. I realized that I used half smut instead of full set so I went back to around 40k steps and then gave it complete 200 picture set hoping it would course correct since non smut is more recent art style. Now it looks like it didn't course correct and will never do that. On the other hand recent iterations are less horny.

	* Notes by uploader: Here is a terrible Ghislaine Dedoldia embedding I made while testing sd-tagging-helper and the new webui dataset tag editor extension. She has no tail because the crops were shit and I only trained on crops made using the helper. Sometimes the eye patch is on the wrong side because of two images where it was on the wrong eye. Stomach scar is sometimes there sort of but probably needed more time in the oven. She doesn't have dark skin because the AI is racist and probably because it was only tagged on half the images.

	* Uploader: Use "dark-skinned female" in your prompt or she will be pale

	* The embedding was trained on NovelAI (final-pruned.ckpt).

	* Uploader's Note: This embedding has a HUGE problem in keeping the signature out - feel free to crop out the signature if you wish to redo the embedding. If you do find a way to remove it without recreating the whole embedding - feel free to post it in 4chan/g/ and I may stumble upon it.

		-hair shading is more subtle now  
		-nipple color transition is also more subtle  
		-eyelashes not as thick as before, probably because i used more pre-2022 pictures. actually bit sad about it, but w/e  
		-eyes in general look better, i recommend generating on 768×768 with highres fix  
		-blonde hair got a pink gradient for some reason  
		-tends to hide dicks between the breasts more often, but does it noticeably better  
		-likes to add backgrounds, i think i overcooked it a bit so those look more like artifacts, perhaps with other prompts it will look better  
		-less hags  
		-from my test prompts, it looked like it breaks anatomy less often now, but i mostly tested pov paizuri  
		-became kinda worse at non-paizuri pictures, less sharpness. because of that, i'm also including 60000 steps version, which is slightly better at that, but in the end, it's a matter of preference, whether to use newer version or not: https://files.catbox.moe/1zt65u.pt

	* has a number of influences on your output, but mostly gives a very soft, painted style to the output image

	* Aesthetic gradient embedding also included, but not necessary

	* check the training data rar to read the filewords to see if you want to call anything it was specifically trained on

* reine (WIP): https://files.catbox.moe/od4609.pt

* WiseSpeak/RubbishFox (updated): https://files.catbox.moe/pzix7f.pt

	* Info: Uses 176 Fanbox images that were preprocessed with splitting, flipping and mild touchup to remove text in Paint on about 1/4th of the images. I removed images from the Preprocess folder that did not have discernable character traits. Most images are of Tamamo since that is his waifu. Total images after split, flip, and corrections was 636. Took 13 hours at 0.000005 Rate at 512x512. Seems maybe a bit more touchy than the 61.5K file, but I believe that when body horror isn't present you can match the RubbishFox's style better.

	* Crashed after 5.3k steps, continued training after when hypernetwork training resuming is broken. Apprently it got better

	* Uploader: Alright, it's done. Maybe it's the small training data or the mediocre tagging but sometimes you get stuff that doesn't resemble their art style. Still releasing the three models I liked though, they work nicely with img2img.

* Funamusea/Okegom/Mogeko (12500 steps): https://mega.nz/file/SBg0zBIa#BU1KkBY1vMvLXpfkDci1RZYi5f8P0yN5oyQzGYXF8q0

	* Notes by uploader:

	> Most results (at least with img2img) will have a chibi style regardless of your prompt.  
	> 30 steps recommended.  
	> Does very well with white skin/pale characters, this is because the hypernetwork is trained mainly on white characters. Not because I wanted to but because it's what she tends to draw the most.  
	> Hypernetwork has most of her NSFW art in its data including a fanart which looks like it was drawn by her, just so the AI has a reference. So, yes, it can generate nudity and porn in her style, although I'm not sure about penetration stuff because I haven't tried.  
	> "outline" tag is recommended in prompt to have the same thick outlines she often uses in her artwork.

	* uploader: Hypernetwork trained on 109 total images dating from 2015 to 2022, including his deleted NSFW commissions and Fanbox content. Also trained on like two or three pre-2015 images just because why not. Should be able to do Touhou characters (especially Alice and Patchouli) extremely well.

	* I recommend using the white pupils tag for the eyes to look like picrel.

	* V3 (Image:164 augmented to 328, Learning Rate 5e-5:328,5e-6:14000,5e-7:20000, steps: 10k): https://files.catbox.moe/1r36tp.pt

		* uploader: Unlike V1, I manually edited almost all tags generated with deepdanbooru with the dataset tag editor

	* Uncensored X/Y plots:

		* V3 (strength: 1) : https://files.catbox.moe/tse4kr.png, https://files.catbox.moe/8y91f0.png (no 'sketch')

		* V1 (strength: 0.7): https://files.catbox.moe/pml06i.png ('sketch'), https://files.catbox.moe/18993y.png (without "sketch")

	* Uploader: Those two hypernetwork seem to be more accurate if we put "sketch" in the prompt. V1 break if we set hypernetwork strength to 1 (or anything over 0.8) and 0.7 seem to be the sweet spot. V3 does not seem to have the same problem.

* Hataraki Ari (30k, 50k, and 100k steps): https://mega.nz/folder/TZ5jXYrb#-NXJo8wlmanr8ebbJ5GBBQ

	* Training Info: 

	> Modules: 768, 320, 640, 1280  
	> Hypernetwork layer structure: 1, 2, 1  
	> Activation function: swish + dropout  
	> Layer weights initialization / normalization: none  
	> 115 images, size 512x512, manually selected from patreon gallery on sadpanda  
	> Watermarks + text manually removed or cropped out  
	> Deepbooru used for captions  
	> Hypernetwork learning rate: 5e-6:12000, 5e-7:30000, 2.5e-7:50000, 1e-7:100000

	* Uploader note: Works best with huge or gigantic breasts. Occasionally has some problems with extra limbs or nipples. Tags like tall female, muscular female or abs may lead to small heads or weirdly proportioned bodies, so I recommend lowering the weighting on those.

* Raichiyo33 style hypernetwork. Not perfect but seems good enough.

	> Trained with captions from booru tags for compability with model + art by raichiyo33 in the beginning over NAI model.  Use "art by raichiyo33" in the begining of prompt to triggering.  
	> Some useful tips: 
	> 1) with tag "traditional media" produce more beautiful results
	> 2) try to avoid too much negativ promts. I use only "bad anatomy, bad hands, lowres, worst quality, low quality, blurry, bad quality" even that seems too much. With many UC tags (especially with full NAI set of uc) it will produce almost generic NAI result. 
	> 3) Use CLIP -2 (because its trained over NAI, ofc)

	> This hyper network was trained for 2000 steps at different learning rates on different batches of images (usually 25 images each batch)
	> 
	> I suggest using an HYPERNETWORK STRENGTH OF 0,5 or maybe up to 0,8 since it's really strong ; it is compatible with almost all anime like models and it performs great even with semi realistic ones.
	>

	> The examples are made using the Nai model , but it works with ally , and any other anime based model if strength is adjusted acccordingly , also it COULD work with f111 and other models with the right prompts , to get really fat labia majora/minora , and/or gaping

	> Yordles = to be use with an HYPERNETWORK STRENGHT OF 0,7  
	> Yordles-FullSTR = to be useed with an HYPERNETWORK STRENGHT OF 1
	> 
	> I suggest experimenting alot with prompts since they both give roughly the same results but i included both since some people might like the stronger version better.
	> 
	> They were trained with NAI but they work best with Arena's Gape60 (i highly suggest using it)
	> 
	> They are trained on the following tags: Yordle, tristana, lulu_(league_oflegends), poppy(league_oflegends), vex(league_oflegends), shortstack  
	> I don't know why but discord modifies the tags for lulu, vex and poppy so read the readme txt !! 
	> 
	> I highly suggest building around a specific character but you can make your own yordles too! try using different prompts to amplify the chances of getting a specific character .
	> 
	> Example for Poppy : masterpiece, highest quality, digital art, colored skin, blue skin, white skin, 1girl, (yordle:1.1), purple eyes, (poppy(league_of_legends):1.1), shortstack, twintails, fang, red scarf, white armor, thighs, sitting, night, gradient background , grass , blonde hair , on back, :d

* You can set a learning rate of "0.1:500, 0.01:1000, 0.001:10000" in textual inversion and it will follow the schedule

* Tip: combining natural language sentences and tags can create a better training

* Dreambooth on 2080ti 11GB (anon's guide):

	* Save checkpoint every N steps: 0

	* ON "Use 8bit Adam", note on this

	* ON "Gradient Checkpointing"

	* "Mixed Precision: fp16"

	* 8bit adam doesn't appear to help unless you also add the TORCH_COMMAND line into your launch bat as per the github page:

``` python
set TORCH_COMMAND="pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116"
```

* Training a TI on 6gb (not sure if safe or even works, instructions by uploader anon): https://pastebin.com/iFwvy5Gy

	* Have xformers enabled.

	> This diff does 2 things.
	> 1. enables cross attention optimizations during TI training. Voldy disabled the optimizations during training because he said it gave him bad results. However, if you use the InvokeAI optimization or xformers after the xformers fix it does not give you bad results anymore.  
	> This saves around 1.5GB vram with xformers
>
	>2. unloads vae from VRAM during training. This is done in hypernetworks, and idk why it wasn't in the code for TI. It doesn't break anything and doesn't make anything worse.
	>This saves around .2 GB VRAM
	>
	>After you apply this, turn on Move VAE and CLIP to RAM and Use cross attention optimizations while training

Outlayer % is if you want to filter out extreme points 100% means all points are considered for trendline 95% filters out top and bottom 5 etc. Basically you can use this to see where the training started fucking up.

Training:

> Rate: 5e-5:1000, 5e-6:5000, 5e-7:20000, 5e-8:100000  
> Max Steps: 100,000

* Anon's Guide: 

1. Having good text tags on the images is rather important. This means laboriously going through and adding tags to the BLIP tags and editing the BLIP tags as well, and often manually describing the image. Fortunately my dataset had only like…30 images total, so I was able to knock it out pretty quick, but I can imagine it being completely obnoxious for a 500 image gallery. Although I guess you could argue that strict prompt accuracy becomes less important as you have more training examples. Again, if they would just add an automatic deepdanbooru option alongside the BLIP for preprocessing that would take away 99% of the work.

2. Vectors. Honestly I started out making my embedding at 8, it was shit. 16, still shit but better. 20, pretty good, and I was like fuck it let's go to 50 and that was even better still. IDK. I don't think you can go much higher though if you want to use your tag anyway where but the very beginning of a 75 token block. I had heard that having more tokens = needing more images and also overfitting but I did not find this to be the case.

3. The other major thing I needed to do is make a character.txt for textual inversion. For whatever reason, the textual inversion templates literally have NO character/costume template. The closest thing is subject which is very far off and very bad. Thus, I had to write my own: https://files.catbox.moe/wbat5x.txt

4. Yeah for whatever reason the VAE completely fries and fucks up any embedding training and you can only find this from reading comments on 4chan or in the issues list of the github. The unload VAE when training DOES NOT WORK for textual embedding. Again, I don't know why. Thus it is absolutely 100% stone cold essential to rename or move your vae then relaunch everything before you do any textual inversion training. Don't forget to put it back afterwards (and relaunch again) because without the VAE everything is a blurry mess and faces and like sloth from the goonies.

So all told, this is the process:

1. Get a dataset of images together. Use the preprocess tab and the BLIP and the split and flip and all that.

2. Laboriously go through EVERY SINGLE IMAGE YOU JUST MADE while simultaneously looking at their text file BLIP descriptions and updating them with the booru tags or deepdanbooru tags (which you have to have manually gotten ahead of time if you want them), and making sure the BLIP caption is at least roughly correct, and deleting any image which doesn't feature your character after the cropping operation if it was too big. EVERY. SINGLE. IMAGE. OAJRPIOANJROPIanrpianfrpianra

3. Now that the hard parts over, just make your embedding using the make embedding page. Choose some vector amount (I mean I did good with 50 whatever), set girl as your initialization or whatever's appropriate.

4. Go to train page and get training. Everything on the page is pretty self explanatory. I used 5e-02:2000, 5e-03:4000, 5e-04:6000, 5e-05 for the learning rate schedule but you can fool around. Make sure the prompt template file is pointed at an appropriate template file for what you're trying to do like the character one I made, and then just train. Honestly, it shouldn't take more than 10k steps which goes by pretty quick even with batch size 1.

OH and btw, obviously use https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl to scrape your image dataset from whichever boorus you like. Don't forget the --write-tags flag!

Vector guide by anon:  
Think of vectors per token as the number of individual traits the ai will associate with your embedding. For something like "coffee cup", this is going to be pretty low generally, like 1-4. For something more like an artist's style, you're going to want it to be higher, like 12-24. You could go for more, but you're really eating into your token budget on prompts then.

Its also worth noting, the higher the count, the more images and more varied images you're going to want.

You want the ai to find things that are consistent thematics in your image. If you use a small sample size, and all your images just happen to have girls in a bikini, or all with blonde hair, that trait might get attributed to your prompt, and suddenly "coffee cup" always turns out blonde girls in bikinis too.

* Another training guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/stablediffusion/comments/y91luo

* Super simple embed guide by anon: Grab the high quality images, run them through the processor. Create an embedding called `art by {artist}. Then train that same embedding with your processed images and set the learning rate to the following: `0.1:500,0.05:1000,0.025:1500,0.001:2000,1e-5` Run it for 10k steps and you'll be good. No need for an entire hypernetwork.

**What is pickling/getting pickled?**

> ckpt files and python files can execute code. Getting pickled is when these files execute malicious code that infect your computer with malware. It's a memey/funny way of saying you got hacked.

* Automatic1111's webui should unpickle the files for you, but that is only 1 line of defense: https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/search?q=pickle&type=commits

* anon: there are checks but they can be disabled and you can still bypass with nested things

* https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html, https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-pickle

* anon:  
	pickle is a format that can load code objects  
	originally the objects weren't sanitized, so remote code could run

	> by implementing **reduce** in a class which instances we are going to pickle, we can give the pickling process a callable plus some arguments to run  
	now **reduce** is restricted (anything not NN related), the joke lives on as a meme

> More info in sdupdates (1), various wikis, and various rentrys  
> TLDR: it mashes tokens until it finds things in the model that matches most with the training images

**What is…?**

> What is a VAE?  
Variational autoencoder, basically a "compressor" that can turn images into a smaller representation and then "decompress" them back to their original size. This is needed so you don't need tons of VRAM and processing power since the "diffusion" part is done in the smaller representation (I think). The newer SD 1.5 VAEs have been trained more and they can recreate some smaller details better.  
> What is pruning?  
Removing unnecessary data (anything that isn't needed for image generation) from the model so that it takes less disk space and fits more easily into your VRAM  
> What is a pickle, not referring to the python file format? What is the meme surrounding this?  
When the NAI model leaked people were scared that it might contain malicious code that could be executed when the model is loaded. People started making pickle memes because of the file format.  
> Why is some stuff tagged as being 'dangerous', and why does the StableDiffusion WebUI have a 'safe-unpickle' flag? -- I'm stuck on pytorch 1.11 so I have to disable this  
Safe unpickling checks the pickle's code library imports against an approved list. If it tried to import something that isn't on the list it won't load it. This doesn't necessarily mean it's dangerous but you should be cautious. Some stuff might be able to slip through and execute arbitrary code on your computer.  
> Is the rentry stuff all written by one person or many?  
There are many people maintaining different rentries.

> When a token is at a boundary of 75 and it is not a comma, the last n tokens (n which can be spec. in config) are checked to see if any are a comma. If one is, tokens are padded starting from that comma to the next mult. of 75, and the tokens that were there before get moved into the next token set.

**How do I use highres fix?**

From anon:  
> Enable Upscale latent space image when doing hires. fix in settings  
> Enable Highres. fix  
> Keep the width and height to 0 in the section that opened up, play around with denoising from the default 0.7  
> Adjust sliders from 512x512 to your desired higher resolution  
> wait longer for each generation  
> learn to use SD Upscale script in img2img because it can be better sometimes

**Why doesn't model merging work?**

> Make sure you have enough ram (2 models that are 2 gb requires 4 gb of ram). Increase your page file if necessary

**Why is my downloaded embedding so bad?**

> Make sure that you're using the correct model. Anon says,"Embeddings and hypernetworks only work reliably on the model they were trained for". Also, play around with weighting your embedding

**Which depickler should I use?**

> By anon: The webui scanner is very basic. The zxix scanner is much more thorough but it is not clear that it provides truly comprehensive protection. The lopho scanner is targeted directly at Torch models (great!) but is not a standalone script (not great!).

**What's the difference between embeds, hypernetworks, and dreambooths? What should I train?**  
Anon:

> I've tested a lot of the model modifications and here are my thoughts on them:  
> embeds: these are tiny files which find the best representation of whatever you're training them on in the base model. By far the most flexible option and will have very good results if the goal is to group or emphasize things the model already understands  
> hypernetworks: there are like instructions that slightly modify the result of the base model after each sampling step. They are quite powerful and work decently for everything I've tried (subjects, styles, compositions). The cons are they can't be easily combined like embeds. They are also harder to train because good parameters seem to vary wildly so a lot of experimentation is needed each time  
> dreambooth: modifies part of the model itself and is the only method which actually teaches it something new. Fast and accurate results but the weights for generating adjacent stuff will get trashed. These are gigantic and have the same cons as embeds

If you batch just tags together you'll find that adding one tag can change the whole prompt and is affected by words near it, whereas with a sentence the changes are more subtle and gradual because words have seperators between them. It makes sense to just make good sentences in the first place

> it tries to simulate how synapses in the human brain connect when looking at text. The weights it places or the words it interpret have different values based on interpretation. But practically it means if you prompt

```
leather, collar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,cheese 
```

> The filler text just means you're likely to get a leather collar with cheese separately. To get a leather cheese collar its going to be very difficult since these concepts are far removed from one another.

as this build of Torch is built with CUDA 11.8 whereas the one that AUTOMATIC uses by defualt is not and will cause issue.

Torch is not able to use GPU error fix by anon:  
Activate the webui VENV and Force reinstall torch with cuda  
If you are on windows:  
open cmd on

Guide to installing NAI by anon:

``` paython
Guide for locally installing NovelAI:

DOWNLOADING:
get NovelAI from magnet:?xt=urn:btih:5bde442da86265b670a3e5ea3163afad2c6f8ecc&dn=novelaileak
---or from picrel >>35097470 (Dead)
get MinGW/Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win (or direct download: https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.37.3.windows.1/Git-2.37.3-64-bit.exe
---When installing Git, make sure to select "Git Bash here".
get Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ (or direct download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe
---When installing Python, make sure to select "add to Path".

Start Git, and type "git clone https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui";
When you do this, it will create a folder called \stable-diffusion-webui\ (by default, in C:\Users\Username\)

When you download the torrent:
1. In \stableckpt\animefull-final-pruned\ rename 'model.ckpt' to 'final-pruned.ckpt'
---Note: the 'animefull' model is the best overall, but struggles at recognizing and outputting VTuber characters in particular. For a better model in that regard, use the 'SFW' model instead; despite the name, it is not SFW-limited.
2. Move 'final-prunded.ckpt' (the file you just renamed) and animevae.pt from \stableckpt\ to \stable-diffusion-webui\models\Stable-diffusion
3. Rename 'animevae.pt' (the file you just moved) to 'final-pruned.vae.pt'
4. Create a new folder \stable-diffusion-webui\models\hypernetworks\ and move all of the modules (which end in .pt) from \stableckpt\modules\modules\ (in the NovelAI)

Whenever you want to run NovelAI from your computer, run webui-user.bat. The first time will initialize, which may cause some errors.
If there are no errors, it will give you a web address (usually http://127.0.0.1:7860/ ). This is the WebUI, from which you run NovelAI using your computer's disk.
The usual errors will require you to edit the .bat--do this in Notepad or n++.
There will be a line of code beginning with "COMMANDLINE_ARGS=". Add "--precision full --no-half" directly after this, on the same line. (remove the quotations)
If you get an error about "--skip-torch-cuda-test", add it as well (making the line "--skip-torch-cuda-test --precision full --no-half").

After you started the .bat and got the WebUI loaded, go to Settings and scroll to Stable Diffusion. Set the checkpoint to final-pruned and the hypernetwork of your choice.
```
