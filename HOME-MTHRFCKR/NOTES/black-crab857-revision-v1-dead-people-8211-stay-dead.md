<div class="video-container">[![Black Crab](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51964279863_4ee4d5bc27_z.jpg)](https://flic.kr/p/2naUvZH)</div>Last night we watched the movie “Black Crab” on Netflix. Overall I give it 3 out of 5 Stars. Great cinematic visuals with great acting by Rooney Mara (Prometheus) Movie wise I felt like it was another country’s Version of “Red Dawn”

But this isn’t about the movie, it’s about it’s soundtrack.

While the movies visuals were great, it couldn’t keep my attention very well but the music kept me listening entirely which is probably why @Tawnie Nicole Shelton gave me shit towards the end for not watching and paying attention. I wasn’t paying attention but I was listening while trying to figure out who did the soundtrack.

When I finally found some info on the artist who did the soundtrack, I was immediately more interested in the story behind who created it, than the movie itself. I couldn’t find much about this mystery band behind the soundtrack until I looked them up on Spotify. The band is “Dead People” and their Spotify Bio was the coolest thing I’ve come across in a long time.

“Dead People are two young brothers and their mother. She sings and writes lyrics and they create the music together in their home studio. Dead People are inspired by 80’s synth-pop, 90’s techno, Californian sunsets, Italian graveyards and the photography of Diane Arbus. They sing about ruined relationships, lonely nights and a civilization on the edge of the abyss.

In medieval times the phrase “memento mori” was popular in art. In Latin it means “remember death”. Paintings showed how love, money, happiness and all the other things that we strive for in life are nothing but shallow vanities that death will take away from us in the end. Instead of chasing these things, mankind should focus on God and the eternal afterlife. 650 years after the Black Death inspired artists to paint dancing skeletons in European churches, a new virus is ravaging the world and Dead People are releasing their debut single. Perhaps we don’t need more reminders of our own mortality right now, but the band’s melancholic yet elegant electronic pop is a perfect soundtrack to a time of isolation, fear and social distancing. “Safety Lines” is a song about a broken, vengeful heart: “I don’t want to save you. You owe me about a million lives”. It also deals with the brevity of life. The painful realization that there’s no holy grail, nor photo app filter, to save us from decay..”

With that being said, here’s the music video for the closing song “Stay Dead”
