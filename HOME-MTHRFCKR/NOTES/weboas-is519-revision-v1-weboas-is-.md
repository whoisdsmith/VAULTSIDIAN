The internet‚Äôs portal to new discoveries

A few years back I came across what used to be an unknown and hidden website called ‚Äúweboas.is‚Äù

It will always be one of my favorite internet discoveries.

This was no ordinary website, this was as if someone had a master key to all of the hidden and unknown places on the web and then created a back door to them from a central location. A web portal known as ‚ÄúWeboas.is‚Äù

While most people used this site for piracy, leaks and other things. I used it for the forum, more specifically for the ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äôs Finds‚Äù section which is where I met Webby.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://c0debl0ck.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/img_6128.jpg?w=1024)</figure>He was the founder and creator of weboasis (and the one person I thought may have been a glitch in the matrix,) because he had so much knowledge of the internet and knew how and where to find some pretty amazing things.

Once a week he would drop a shit ton of links that he had discovered and I would go through them all and provide feedback afterwards. Everything on the site and the forum was encrypted and every person was anonymous. Especially Webby and Webby was not his real name. The only thing I know is that he was born in 1992 and he signed all his posts and updates as Webby.

A few months back, he started posting less and less to the forum and I began looking for new sources or sites like his. (With no luck)

Anyways I went to go see if maybe he had dropped some new links on the forum and when I got there I saw this üòî

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">![](https://c0debl0ck.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/img_6127.jpg?w=705)</figure>He uploaded his source code and about 20 mirrors to the site have come to life since.

He was an unbelievably smart and awesome person

And It sucks he chose to take his own life in order to find peace.

R.I.P Webby

For anyone interested in what he created and did with weboasis, here‚Äôs a link to a mirrored site that someone created and archived since his passing.
