• Two pills a day to completely change everything.  
• For better and for worse.  
• Remapping neurons and elevating heart-rate.  
• Pushing you to move in a single focused direction.  
• Not always the direction you should be focusing on.  
• Going from normal to all time highs.  
• Ending in all time lows until it’s time for another dose.  
• Day in. Day out.  
• It’s never enough.  
• Begin. End. Repeat.

What have I become?

Who could I have been without this?

A single dose creates an illusion of a better you,

A second dose creates a belief that you have can’t be you without it.

You become a slave to a tiny pill made of chemical compounds that work against you, not for you.

By the time you realize that you are a slave to it, it doesn’t matter.

Just take another dose and forget about the reality of the situation.

A reality that always comes back once the dose’s life cycle ends.

Which means that it’s time for another dose.

Unlike Nikki, you will die a slave.
