Whois Data Reminder Policy

Dear Dustin Smith,

Thank you for choosing to register your domain names with [Name.com](http://name.com/). This is your annual notice to remind you that all registered domain names must have accurate and up-to-date Whois contact information.

Please review the domain information below and verify its accuracy. If all information is up-to-date then no changes are necessary at this time. Inaccurate or outdated information must be corrected by logging into your [Name.com](http://name.com/) account. If you need to make any changes to your contact information, please [log in](https://www.name.com/account/login) to your [Name.com](http://name.com/) account or contact the party responsible for registering your domain name.

You can edit your contact information by following the URL provided below:

While we do respect your privacy, we are required by ICANN, our regulating authority, to send these notices annually to all domain contacts. To learn more about this process and why it is required, please visit ICANN’s website:  
[https://www.icann.org/whois/wdrp-registrant-faq.htm](https://www.icann.org/whois/wdrp-registrant-faq.htm)

You are required to have accurate contact information whether your Whois data is public, or privatized. If any of the Whois information for your domain names is inaccurate, ICANN policy requires that you correct it. Please know that under the terms of your registration agreement in certain cases the provision of false Whois (contact) information can be grounds for cancellation of your domain name registration.

If you are not the registrant for a domain name registered with [Name.com](http://name.com/) and you have received this email in error, please send an email to [support@name.com](mailto:support@name.com) and we will remove you from our list. We apologize for any inconvenience.

Thank you for choosing [Name.com](http://name.com/), please feel free to follow up with our Support Department at [support@name.com](mailto:support@name.com) with any questions or concerns you might have.
