Japansmusicworld + Artist Name

So in my case I Google for "Japansmusicworld + Gackt"

....It looks similar to Jrock ~Utilidades~ ... an older website I used a lot back in 2008.

From this site, I was able to grab almost all of Camui Gackt's discography (excluding the Yellow Fried Chickenz stuff).

Everything from the "Mizerable" single & the Mini Album (I just call those E.P.) to Diabolos is on here. All in 320 kbps. Yeah I know, it's not FLAC, blah blah blah. But consider that back in 2008, if you were downloading Japanese Rock stuff you were LUCKY if you could find it in 192 kbps, if you even found it at all.

Even when The Pirate Bay was still active, most J-Rock uploads were in lower bitrates. Like 128 kbps. I checked around a mirror version of TPB and anyone who WAS uploading / seeding that kind of stuff is long gone....

There are other bands on this thing too, The Gazette, MUCC, Ancafe, L'arc en ciel, Dir en grey etc.... But not everything on here is 320 kbps, some of the links for The Gazette albums flat out don't work, which sucks.

But they have most of the Dir en grey discog and I downloaded the Unraveling E.P. and that was in 320 kbps -- just pay attention to what it says the file size is when you're filling in the captcha (the letter / number image thing that filters out bots).

.

Happy pirating, my fellow Weebs.

(If you want album art, I suggest you find it on Discogs and tweak the size settings to 8.889 by 8.889 then set the bottom value to 72 pixels per inch with Re-Sample turned on, this is what fits my Hiby R3 Saber, any other cover sizes don't seem to show up... The album art these files ~already~ come with are grainy and blocky, so you'll want to find better album covers and embed the meta data with the Windows app called Tag & Rename --- You can also tweak the Color Balance & Contrast using Photoshop, since some of those album cover scans from Discogs are a bit dry or washed out...)
