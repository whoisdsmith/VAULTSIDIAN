**Amphetamine, past and present - a** 

# **pharmacological and clinical perspective**

## discovered  by  Barger  and  Dale  in  1910,  it  was  not  until  1927  that this  molecule  was  first  synthesised  by  the  chemist,  G.  A.  Alles, whilst  he  was  searching  for  a  less  costly  and  more  easily  synthe­

sised  substitute  for  ephedrine.  Experiments  performed  in  animals and  human  subjects  by  Alles  and  others  unequivocally  revealed a-methylphenethylamine’s  ability  to  reverse  drug-induced  anaes­ thesia  and  produce  arousal  and  insomnia  (see  reviews  by  Bett, 

1946; Guttmann and Sargent, 1937). The trade name ‘Benzedrine®’ for  racemic  a-methylphenethylamine  was  registered  by  the  phar­ maceutical  company,  Smith,  Kline  and  French.  ‘Amphetamine’, which  is  the  generic  name  for  Benzedrine  devised  by  the  Council on  Pharmacy  and  Chemistry  of  the  American  Medical  Association, was  not  adopted  until  many  years  later.  It  is  the  reason  why  the name  Benzedrine,  not  amphetamine,  appears  in  all  of  the  early publications  (see  Bett,  1946).  Smith,  Kline  and  French  introduced Benzedrine  onto  the  market  in  1935  as  a  treatment  for  narcolepsy (for  which  it  is  still  used  today),  mild  depression,  post-encephalitic  Parkinsonism  and  a  raft  of  other  disorders  (see  Bett,  1946; Guttmann and Sargent, 1937; Tidy, 1938).

As  a  molecule  with  a  single  chiral  centre,  amphetamine  exists in  two  optically  active  forms,  i.e.  the  dextro-  (or  </-)  and  levo-  (or /-)  isomers  or  enantiomers  (Figure  1).  Smith,  Kline  and  French 

synthesised  both  isomers,  and  in  1937  commenced  marketing  of rf-amphetamine,  which  was  the  more  potent  of  the  two  isomers, under  the  trade  name  of  Dexedrine®.  Sales  of  Benzedrine  and Dexedrine  in  chemist  stores  were  unrestricted  until  1939,  when these  drugs  could  only  be  obtained  either  on  prescription  from  a registered  medical  practitioner  or  by  signing  the  Poison  Register (Bett,  1946).  The  cognitive-enhancing  properties  of  amphetamine were  quickly  recognised,  with  reports  of  Benzedrine  producing improvements in  intelligence tests  leading to  its widespread  ==use to ==

**Abstract** Amphetamine  was  discovered  over  100  years  ago.  Since  then,  it  has  transformed  from  a  drug  that  was  freely  available  without  prescription  as  a  panacea for  a  broad  range  of  disorders  into  a  highly  restricted  Controlled  Drug  with  therapeutic  applications  restricted  to  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder 

(ADHD)  and  narcolepsy.  This  review  describes  the  relationship  between  chemical  structure  and  pharmacology  of  amphetamine  and  its  congeners. Amphetamine's  diverse  pharmacological  actions  translate  not  only  into  therapeutic  efficacy,  but  also  into  the  production  of  adverse  events  and  liability for  recreational  abuse.  Accordingly,  the  balance  of  benefit/risk  is  the  key  challenge  for  its  clinical  use.  The  review  charts  advances  in  pharmaceutical development  from  the  introduction  of  once-daily  formulations  of  amphetamine  through  to  lisdexamfetamine,  which  is  the  first  (/-amphetamine 

prodrug  approved  for  the  management  of  ADHD  in  children,  adolescents  and  adults.  The  unusual  metabolic  route  for  lisdexamfetamine  to  deliver (/-amphetamine  makes  an  important  contribution  to  its  pharmacology.  How  lisdexamfetamine's  distinctive  pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  profile translates into sustained efficacy as a treatment for ADHD and its reduced potential for recreational abuse is also discussed.

**A short history of amphetamine** Although  racemic  a-methylphenethylamine  (amphetamine)  was 

reduce  stress  and  improve  concentration  and  intellectual  perfor­

mance  by  academics,  students  and  medical  professionals  (see 

Guttmann  and  Sargent,  1937;  Tidy,  1938).  In  his  1946  review, 

Bett  commented  on  the  widespread  use  of  ‘energy  pills’  by  the 

allied  forces  in  World  War  II,  estimating  that  150  million 

Benzedrine  tablets  were  supplied  to  British  and  American  service 

personnel  during  the  course  of  the  global  conflict.  In  spite  of  con­

siderable  coverage  in  the  medical  literature  and  the  popular  press 

describing  the  powerful  central  effects  of  these  new  drugs,  the 

addictive  potential  of  amphetamine  was  largely  dismissed  (see 

Bett, 1946; Guttmann and Sargent, 1937; Tidy, 1938).

It  was  Bradley  (1937)  who  first  reported  the  beneficial  effects 

of  Benzedrine  in  treating  children  with  severe  behavioural  prob­

lems,  who  would  now  be  diagnosed  as  suffering  from  attention 

deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  (American  Psychiatric 

Association,  1994).  Bradley  treated  30  subjects  for  a  week,  and  in 

approximately  half  of  them  he  observed  remarkable  improve­

ments  in  their  school  performance,  behaviour  and  demeanour. 

These  therapeutic  benefits  unequivocally  derived  from  the  drug 

because they were  apparent from the  first day o f Benzedrine treat­

ment and disappeared as soon as it was discontinued. Although

/-amphetamine  (Cydril®)  achieved  far  less  attention  than  either the  racemate  or  (Z-isomer,  clinical  trials  conducted  in  the  1970s demonstrated  that  both  isomers  of  amphetamine  were  clinically effective  in  treating  ADHD  (Arnold  et  al.,  1972,  1973,  1976).  The use  of  Benzedrine  to  treat  ADHD  declined  dramatically  after Gross  (1976)  reported  that  the  racemate  was  significantly  less clinically  effective  than  Dexedrine.  Currently,  the  only  use  of /-amphetamine  in  ADHD  medications  is  in  mixed  salts/mixed enantiomers  amphetamine  (MES-amphetamine),  which  consists of  a  3:1  enantiomeric  mixture  c/-amphetamine:/-amphetamine salts  that  is  available  in  both  immediate-release  (Adderall®, generic)  and  extended-release  (Adderall  XR®,  generic)  formula­ tions.  A  recent  development  in  the  amphetamine  field  is  the  intro­ duction  of  an  amphetamine  prodrug,  lisdexamfetamine  dimesylate (Vyvanse®).

## **amphetamine in the treatment of ADHD**

## ADHD  is  arguably  the  most  under-diagnosed  and  treated  of  all 

psychiatric  disorders,  especially  in  adults  (Kooij  et  al.,  2010).  The 

most recent European data  suggest that about 5% of  the population 

suffer  from  ADHD  in  any  one  year,  with  a  total  of  about  3  million 

patients in  Europe (Wittchenet  al., 2011).  Further estimates  put the 

cost of each patient  at about £5000 per  year in the UK (Gustavsson 

et  al.,  2011).  Of  the  total  just  over  half  are  direct  treatment  costs 

and  the  rest  indirect  costs,  for  example  lost  productivity,  social 

harm,  negative  impact  on  family  life,  increased  incidence  of  acci­

dents and costs associated with criminality and legal intervention.

The  impact  in  terms  of  lost  quality  of  life  (days  lived  with  disabil­ ity)  puts  ADHD  in  the  top  10  disorders  of  the  brain  in  Europe. Treatment  of  ADHD  is  generally  inadequate,  with  estimates  sug­ gesting that, at best, less than one-third  of patients with the diagno­ sis get appropriate treatment (Gustavsson et al., 2011). Although  amphetamine  has  been  established  as  an  effective treatment  for  ADHD,  as  well  as  other  central  nervous  system (CNS) disorders  such as  narcolepsy for  decades, its  use in  the UK (and  in  the  wider  European  context)  has  been  rather  limited  in comparison  with  its  widespread  use  in  the  USA.  The  reasons  for this  are  complex  and  relate  to  social  and  medical  attitudes  to  the condition  of  ADHD,  pharmaceutical  industry  marketing  policies, as  well  as  to  concerns  regarding  the  use  of  drugs  in  paediatric indications  which  are  perceived  to  have  a  high  potential  for  rec­ reational abuse and to cause addiction. ADHD  has  long  suffered  from  being  considered  an ‘American’  diagnosis,  and  for  many  decades  there  was  a  con­ certed  attempt  by  some  experts  in  child  psychiatry  to  deny,  or at  least  minimise,  its  existence  in  the  UK.  On  top  of  this,  on  the rare  occasions  when  the  disorder  was  identified,  the  preferred treatment  option  was  psychotherapy  because  it  fitted  with  the background  of  the  child  psychiatrists  and  psychologists  who were  responsible  for  managing  these  patients,  ft  was  left  to certain  paediatricians  to  develop  the  requisite  expertise  in  the use  of  stimulants  for  treating  children  with  ADHD,  which many  did  quite  successfully.  In  recent  years,  child  psychiatrists have  begun  to  assume  a  prescribing  role  as  well,  largely  using methylphenidate preparations.

Amphetamines,  i.e.  racemic  amphetamine,  d-amphetamine and  methamphetamine,  were  widely  used  to  promote  wakefulness in World  War II,  which in  turn led  to a  large increase  in production that  resulted  in  large surp luses of the se  drugs  after the  war. Much of  these  stocks  got  into  the  ‘black  market’,  and  in  the  1950s d-amphetamine  abuse  became  recognised.  In  a  classic  study  of that  period,  Connell  from  the  Institute  of  Psychiatry  reported  a group  of  heavy  d-amphetamine  users  who  had  become  paranoid (Connell,  1966).  This  flagged  up  the  potential  psychiatric  dangers of  this  drug  and  may  have  encouraged  prescribers  away  from d-amphetamine  and  on  to  methylphenidate.  Another  factor  was the use of d-amphetamine as an antidepressant in the  1950s before the  discovery  of  the  tricyclic  monoamine  reuptake  inhibitors. There  were  cases  of  misuse  by  patients,  and  also  a  significant degree  of  diversion  of  the  prescribed  drug  into  youth  misuse  and/ or abuse that  may also have  contributed to wariness  by prescribers regarding  its  clinical  use.  In  later  years,  local  outbreaks  of d-amphetamine  abuse  have  occurred  in  various  parts  of  the  UK, often  using  locally  synthesised  d-amphetamine;  again,  this  will have made  doctors shy  away from  prescribing d-amphetamine  lest it  contributes  to  its  misuse.  In  the  USA,  d-amphetamine-containing  medications,  especially  MES-amphetamine,  have  been  very widely  used  as  treatments  for  ADHD.  Familiarity  with  prescribed amphetamines  together  with  the  increased  availability  of  more and more  tamper-deterrent drug  formulations to  reduce the  poten­ tial  for  abuse,  for  example  Adderall  XR®,  have  created  a  situation where in  the USA  the abuse risk  of d-amphetamine  is perceived as being  similar  to  that  of  methylphenidate.  This  fact,  along  with  the

#### perception that  rf-amphetamine is  much safer  than the  more potent and  enduring  stimulant  methamphetamine,  which  is  now  widely abused, has resulted in a  more relaxed attitude of physicians  in the USA  to  the  prescribing  of  rf-amphetamine.  Luckily,  for  reasons that  are  obscure,  the  recreational  abuse  methamphetamine  has never  really  caught  on  in  Europe,  and  almost  all  illegal  use  of  the amphetamines is confined to rf-amphetamine as the sulphate salt.

**The pharmacology of amphetamine** The  chemical  structure,  particularly  the  3-dimensional  (3-D) 

## structure  of  amphetamine,  is  critical  in d etermining  the  pharmaco­ logical  effects  that  underpin  its  considerable  therapeutic  benefits and  also  its  liability  for  recreational  abuse.  Amphetamine  belongs to  the  class  of  drugs  called  the  ‘P-phenylethylamines’.  Although  it was synthesised many  decades before the  discovery that the  mon­ oamines,  i.e.  noradrenaline  (norepinephrine),  dopamine  and 5-hydroxytryptamine  (5-HT;  serotonin),  were  major  neurotrans­ mitters  in  the  central  and  peripheral  nervous  systems,  part  of  the rationale  for  synthesising  racemic  amphetamine  was  its  structural similarity to the biologically active molecule, ephedrine. As  shown  in  Figure  1,  the  similarity  between  the  chemical structures  of  the  catecholamine  neurotransmitters,  noradrenaline and  dopamine,  and  the  isomers  of  amphetamine  is  abundantly clear.  The  3-D  structures  of  the  catecholamines  and  amphetamine molecules  reveal  the  long  planar  conformation  that  is  common  to all  of  these  compounds.  For  amphetamine’s  isomers,  it  is  their planar  conformation,  molecular  size  that  is  similar  to  the  mono­ amines, the presence  of an aromatic ring  and a nitrogen on  the aryl side-chain  which  are  the  prerequisite  physico-chemical  properties of  a  competitive  substrate  for  the  monoamine  reuptake  transport­ ers,  i.e.  NET  (noradrenaline  transporter),  DAT  (dopamine  trans­ porter) and SERT (5-HT transporter). Figure  2  illustrates  the  mechanism  responsible  for  the  uptake transport  of  monoamines  and  amphetamine  into  presynaptic  nerve terminals.  One  molecule  of  monoamine  neurotransmitter  or amphetamine  associates  with  two  Na+  and  one  CT  ion,  and  the resulting  molecular  complex  is  actively  transported  into  the  pre­ synaptic terminal  by the  relevant  monoamine reuptake  transporter. The motive  power for  this active  transport mech anism is  a Na+ ion concentration gradient  (high Na+ on  the outside  of the  nerve terminal/low  Na+  on  the  inside).  The  Na+  concentration  gradient  is maintained  by  Na+/K+  ATPase  that  pumps  two  Na+  ions  out  of  the cell  whilst  simultaneously  pumping  in  one  K+  ion.  There  are  two pools  of  monoamine  neurotransmitter  within  each  type  of  nerve terminal: the  cytosolic pool  that holds  newly synthesised  monoam­ ines,  and  the  vesicular  pool  that  stores  the  monoamines  and  from which they are released when neurones fire action potentials. Although  the  concentration  of  a  monoamine  neurotransmitter in  the  cytosol  of  the  presynaptic  nerve  terminal  is  regulated,  con­ trolled  by  its  rates  of  synthesis,  release,  reuptake  and  catabolism, it  is  now  recognised  that  transport  of  the  monoamine  into  the vesicular  storage  granules  has  a  critically  important  role  to  play  in this  process.  Translocation  of  monoamines  from  the  cytosolic pool  into  the  storage  pool  is  performed  by  a  similar  active  trans­ porter  system,  the  vesicular  monoamine  transporter  2  (VMAT2) (Fei  et  al.,  2008;  Fleckenstein  et  al.,  2009;  Ramamoorthy  et  al., 2011).  Since  amphetamine co mpetes w ith  the  endogenous  mono­ amines for transport into the nerve terminals via NET, DAT or

SERT, the  higher the  concentration of  amphetamine present  in the synapse, the gr eater the number  of amphetamine molecules  trans­ ported  relative  to  every  molecule  of  monoamine  (see  Figure  3). Once  inside  the  presynaptic  terminal,  amphetamine  displaces monoamines  from  the  cytosolic  pool.  Furthermore,  because amphetamine  also  has  affinity  for  VMAT2  (Teng  et  al.,  1998),  it prevents  the  translocation  of  monoamines  into  the  intraneuronal 

storage vesicles.  The outcome  of these  actions is  that the  direction of  the  reuptake  transporter  reverses,  so  that  instead  of  pumping neurotransmitter  from  the  synapse  into  the  nerve  terminal,  it pumps  neurotransmitter  out  of  neurones  into  the  synapse.  This process  is  called  ‘reverse  transport’  or  ‘retro-transport’  (Robertson et al., 2009).

Consistent  with  the  mechanism  described  above,  in  vitro experiments  have  unequivocally  demonstrated  that  ampheta­ mine’s d-  and  /-isomers  non-selectively  release  [3H]monoamines from  preloaded  slices  or  synaptosomes  prepared  from  rat  brain. There  are  experimental  reports  stating  that  rf-amphetamine releases  [3H]  noradrenaline,  dopamine  and  5-HT  from  synapto­ somes  (Holmes  and  Rutledge,  1976;  Rothman  et  al.,  2001)  and brain slices  (Heal et  al., 1998).  /-Amphetamine releases  noradren­ aline,  dopamine  and  5-HT  from  synaptosomes  (Heikkila  et  al., 

1975;  Holmes  and  Rutledge,  1976)  and  noradrenaline  and  dopa­ mine  from  rat  brain  slices  (Easton  et  al.,  2007).  Comparing  the relative  potencies  of d-  and  /-amphetamine,  Heikkila  et  al.  (1975) and  Easton  et  al.  (2007)  reported  that  the  d-isomcr  was  approxi­ mately fourfold  more potent than  the /-isomer  as a  releaser of  [3H] dopamine.  In  contrast,  /-amphetamine  was  either  as  potent,  or more  so,  than  rf-amphetamine  as  a  releaser  of  [3H]noradrenaline (Easton  et a l.,  2007; Heikkila  et al.,  1975). The  monoamine trans­ porters  are  not  particularly  selective  in  terms  of  which  monoam­ ines  they  transport,  and  this  lack  of  selectivity  is  explained  by  the close  structural  similarity  between  them  (Figure  1).  Furthermore, this  structural  similarity  between  the  monoamine  neurotransmit­ ters  and  amphetamine  explains  why  the  latter  has  promiscuous actions  to  release  the  important  CNS  monoamines  (noradrenaline, dopamine  and  5-HT).  Amphetamine  also  releases  adrenaline  from the  peripheral  sympathetic  nervous  system,  an  action  linked  to  its cardiovascular  side  effects.  Although  most  of  these  experiments have  looked  at  the  effects  of  amphetamine  isomers  on  basal  [3H] monoamine  release  from  synaptosomes  or  slices,  amphetamine also  augments  electrically  stimulated  efflux  (Easton  et  al.,  2007). This  action  indicates  that  its  retro-transport  mechanism  can  act both co-operatively with, and independently of, neuronal firing.

Although  the  pharmacological  effect  of  amphetamine  is  pre­ dominantly  mediated  by  monoamine  release,  this  mechanism  is complemented  by  reuptake  inhibition  and  probably  also  inhibition of  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO)  that  combine  additively  or  syner­ gistically  to  augment  synaptic  monoamine  concentrations.  The description  of  amphetamine  as  a  ‘monoamine  reuptake  inhibitor’ often  causes  some  confusion,  and  the  difference  between  the mechanisms  of  amphetamine,  which  is  a  competitive  reuptake transport  substrate,  and  classical  reuptake  inhibitors  is  illustrated in  Figure  3.  The  potency  of  amphetamine’s  isomers  as  monoam­ ine reuptake inhibitors  is summarised in  Table 2 and t hey are com­ pared  against  some  highly  potent  classical  reuptake  inhibitors. (/-Amphetamine  is  generally  accepted  to  be  a  weak  dopamine reuptake  inhibitor  with  a  K:  value  of  -100  nM,  a  moderately potent inhibitor of noradrenaline reuptake (K = 40-50 nM) and a

very  weak  inhibitor  of  5-HT  reuptake  (Kj  =  1.4-3.8  pM). Comparisons of  the isomers  of amphetamine  reveal that  /-amphet­ amine  is  3.2-7-fold  less  potent  than  (/-amphetamine  as  a  dopa­ mine reuptake  inhibitor (Easton  et al.,  2007; Kula  and Baldessarini, 1991;  Richelson  and  Pfenning,  1984),  but  it  is  only  1.8-fold  less potent  against  noradrenaline  (Richelson  and  Pfenning,  1984).  Its potency  is  so  low  that  /-amphetamine  would  not  be  considered  to be a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. Finally,  excess  monoamines  within  the  nerve  terminal  are catabolised  by  the  mitochondrial-bound  enzyme,  MAO.  Inhibition of  MAO  would  further  augment  the  quantity  of  neurotransmitter that is available for retro-transport  into the synapse. Amphetamine’s isomers  have  long  been  known  to  be  inhibitors  of  this  important catabolising  enzyme  (Mantle  et  al.,  1976;  Miller  et  al.,  1980; Robinson,  1985).  Although  this  mechanism  is  often  discounted because  amphetamine  is  a  relatively  weak  inhibitor  of  MAO,  in the  situation  where  amphetamine  is  concentrated  in  presynaptic nerve terminals,  shown in  Figure 3,  it is  probable that  some inhibi­ tion of this enzyme would occur. Although  in  vitro  experiments  provide  a  good  insight  into  indi­ vidual  mechanisms,  the  efficacy  of  amphetamine  relative  to  other

indirect  monoamine  agonists,  for  example  classical  reuptake inhibitors,  can  only  be  estimated  from  in  vivo  experiments.  We have  used  dual-probe  intracerebral  microdialysis  to  explore  the  in vivo  effects  of d-  and  /-amphetamine  in  the  spontaneously  hyper­ tensive  rat  (SHR),  which  has  been  proposed  as  a  rodent  model  of ADHD  (Heal  et  al.,  2008;  Sagvolden,  2000;  Sagvolden  et  al., 2005, 2009; see review by Wickens et al., 2011).

Both  isomers  of  amphetamine  dose-dependently  increased  the extracellular  concentrations  of  noradrenaline  in  the  prefrontal  cor­ tex  (PFC)  and  dopamine  in  the  striatum.  The  pharmacodynamics of their  effects are  typical of  those reported  for monoamine  releas­ ing  agents,  i.e.  a  fast  onset  of  action  with  peak  increases  of noradrenaline  and  dopamine  efflux  occurring  at  30-45  min,  large effects  (400-450%  of  baseline  for  noradrenaline  and  700-1500% of  baseline  for  dopamine),  with  a  relatively  rapid  decline  after  the maximum  (Figure  4).  Although  no  comparative  results  have  been included  in  this  review,  the  magnitude  of  the  increases  produced by amphetamine’s isomers are greater than those reported for clas­

sical  reuptake  inhibitors  such  as  atomoxetine  or  bupropion,  and there is  no dose-effect  ceiling to  amphetamine’s actions  (Bymaster et al., 2002; Nomikos et al., 1989, 1990; Swanson et al., 2006; see

also  Heal  et al.,  2009,2012).  When comparing  the effects  of drugs on  the  efflux  of  catecholamines  in  the  PFC  it  is  important  to  take into  account  the  highly u nusual n euroanatomy  of  this  brain region. The  density  of  DAT  sites  on  PFC  dopaminergic  neurones  is  very low (Hitri  et al.,  1991), and  as a  consequence, most  dopamine that is  released  is  sequestered  via  NET  into  noradrenergic  neurones (Mazei  et  al.,  2002;  Moron  et  al.,  2002;  Stahl,  2003).  In  spite  of the  fact  that  there  are  few  DAT  sites  on  PFC  dopaminergic  neu­ rones,  their  reuptake  capacity  is  sufficient  for  amphetamine  to evoke  substantial  dopamine  release  from  them  (Maisonneuve et al.,  1990; Pum  et al.,  2007; Shoblock  et al.,  2003), though  it has been  suggested  that  much  of  the  release  of  dopamine  in  the  PFC comes from noradrenergic neurones (Shoblock et al., 2004).

When  the  in  vivo  pharmacological  profiles  of  amphetamine’s isomers  are  compared,  d-amphetamine  is  three  to  fivefold  more potent  than  /-amphetamine  (Figure  4).  Moreover,  an  analysis  of the  relative  effects  of  amphetamine’s  isomers  on  individual 

catecholamines  reveals  rf-amphetamine  has  greater  effects  on 

dopamine than  noradrenaline, whereas  /-amphetamine has  a more 

balanced  action  to  increase  both  dopaminergic  than  noradrenergic 

neurotransmission  (Figure  4).  Although  the  effects  of  ampheta­

mine’s  isomers  shown  in  Figure  4  were  obtained  in  one  particular 

rat  strain  predisposed  to  hypertension  (SHRs),  similar  effects  of 

d-   and  /-amphetamine  have  been  reported  from  experiments  per­

formed  in  the  PFC  and  striatum  of  non-hypertensive  strains 

(Cadoni et  al., 1995;  Geranton et  al., 2003;  Kuczenski et  al., 1995; 

Nomikos et  al., 1990;  Pum et  al., 2007;  Figure 5).  Kuczenski et  al. 

(1995)  determined  the  effects  of  both  amphetamine  enantiomers 

on caudate  5-HT release. The effect was  considerably smaller t han 

found  for  dopamine  and  there  was  a  smaller  potency  separation 

between the two isomers.

Earlier  in  the  review,  we  described  the  formulation  of  MES-

amphetamine.  In  vivo  experiments  have  also  been  performed  to 

explore the  interaction between  the 3:1  ratio of d- and  /-isomers in

(2007)  demonstrated  that  the  dynamics  of (/-amphetamine  on  dopamine  efflux  were  not  altered  by  the  pres­ ence of the  /-isomer in the  1:1 ratio present  in the racemate,  but as the  3:1 d-  to  /-isomer  mixture,  /-amphetamine  significantly enhanced  and  prolonged th e  efflux of  dopamine in  the rat  striatum produced  by  (/-amphetamine.  The  authors  hypothesised  that /-amphetamine  in  MES-amphetamine  modulates  the  activity  of DAT  so  that  the  actions  of  the  (/-isomer  are  prolonged  (Joyce et  al.,  2007).  An  alternative  explanation  for  the  observed  prolon­ gation  of  pharmacological  effect  is  that  the  3:1  ratio  of d-  to  /-iso­ mers  in  the  MES-amphetamine  formulation  is  serendipitously optimised  so  that  entry  of  the  (/-isomer  into  catecholaminergic nerve  terminals  is  modulated  by  competition  for  DAT  by  the  /-iso­ mer,  thereby  prolonging  the  neurotransmitter-releasing  action  of the more potent (/-isomer.

**Clinical implications** The  primary  action  of  amphetamine  is  to  increase  synaptic  con­

## centrations  of  monoamine  neurotransmitters,  thereby  indirectly enhancing  noradrenergic,  dopaminergic  neurotransmission  in  the CNS.  Although  amphetamine’s  isomers  are  also  powerful 5-HT-releasing  agents  in  vivo  (Heal  et  al.,  1998;  Kuczenski  et  al., 1995),  this  action  does  not appear  to contribute  to their  efficacy  in treating  ADHD.  This  opinion  is  based  on  clinical  experience  with fenfluramine,  which  is  a  chemical  analogue  of  amphetamine  and a  powerful  releasing  agent  with  a  preferential  action  on  5-HT (Baumann  et  al.,  2000;  Gundlah  et  al.,  1997;  Tao  et  al.,  2002). Donnelly  et  al.  (1989)  reported  that  fenfluramine  was  not  effec­ tive  in  treating  the  disruptive  and  overactive  behaviours  in  ADHD; nor  did  it  ameliorate  the  conduct  disorder  that  was  present  in about  half  of  the  subjects.  However,  it  is  possible  that  the  actions of amphetamine  to increase  serotonergic drive  may have  a benefi­ cial  effect  on  anxiety  or  depression  that  is  often  comorbid  with ADHD.  Thus,  enhanced  catecholaminergic  signalling  is  the  pri­ mary  mediator  of  amphetamine’s  efficacy  in  ADHD  and  narco­ lepsy.  On  the  negative  side,  the  same  pharmacology  is  also responsible  for  amphetamine’s  major  side  effects  and  also  its  lia­ bility  for  recreational  abuse.  Therefore,  optimising  therapeutic efficacy  whilst  simultaneously  maintaining  side  effects  at  an acceptable  level  is  a  difficult  balance  requiring  careful  dose  titra­ tion in the patient.

**Efficacy** ft  has  long  been  accepted  that  in  ADHD  there  is  dysregulation 

## of  the  brain  catecholaminergic  systems  in  the  PFC  and  its  con­ nections  to  subcortical  regions  including  the  striatum  (Amsten and  Dudley,  2005;  Durston,  2003;  Russell  et  al.,  2005). Neuroimaging  studies  in  subjects  with  ADHD  have  revealed anatomical  alterations  and  functional  changes  consistent  with reduced  dopaminergic  function  in  various  dopamine-rich  areas of  the  brain  including  the  frontal  cortex,  striatum  and  globus pallidus  (Castellanos,  2001;  Castellanos  et  al.,  1996;  Ernst et al., 1998; Sieg et al., 1995).

Based on  observations that  the isomers  of amphetamine  evoke very  large  and  rapid  increases  in  the  efflux  of  dopamine  and noradrenaline  in  the  PFC  and  dopamine  in  the  striatum,  it  was predicted  that  these  drugs  would  be  highly  effective  in  the  treat­ ment  of  ADHD.  This  was  confirmed  by  reports  of  efficacy  in ADHD  with  (/-amphetamine  (Arnold  et  al.,  1972,  1973;  Gross, 

1976;  Huestis  et  al.,  1975;  James  et  al.,  2001;  Winsberg  et  al., 

1974),  /-amphetamine  (Arnold  et  al.,  1972,  1973),  racemic amphetamine  (Gross,  1976)  and  MES-amphetamine  (Greenhill et al., 2003;  James et al.,  2001; Pelham et  al., 1999). ft  is generally accepted  that  the  efficacy  of  the  amphetamines  is  not  different from  that  of  methylphenidate  (Faraone  et  al.,  2006;  James  et  al., 2001;  Pelham  et  al.,  2005),  which  is  the  other  major  stimulant used  to  treat  ADHD.  However,  a  meta-analysis  by  Faraone  and Buitelaar  (2010)  did  show  moderately g reater e fficacy  for a mphet­ amine  medications.  This  agrees  with  preclinical  findings  that methylphenidate  also  markedly  enhances  catecholaminergic  drive in the  PFC and  striatum (see  Heal et  al., 2009,2012).  On the  other hand, several  trials have  reported the  superior efficacy  of amphet­ amine  in  the  treatment  of  ADHD  in  comparison  with  the  non­

stimulant,  selective  noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitor,  atomoxetine (Strattera®)  (Biederman  et  al.,  2006;  Faraone  et  al.,  2007;  Wigal et  al.,  2005).  This  finding  fits  well  with  results  from  in  vivo  micro­ dialysis  experiments  that  have  shown  atomoxetine  can  produce moderate  increases  in  extracellular  noradrenaline  and  dopamine in  the  PFC a s a re sult  of  blocking  the  entry  of  both ca techolamine neurotransmitters  into  noradrenergic  neurones  via  NET  sites,  but as  a  selective  noradrenaline  reuptake  inhibitor  it  is  without  effect in  other  brain  regions,  such  as  striatum  and  nucleus  accumbens, where  synaptic  dopamine  concentrations  are  regulated  by  DAT 

sites (Swanson et al., 2006; see also Heal et al., 2009, 2012).

**Safety and adverse events** With  clinical  applications  of  amphetamine  as  a  drug  to  combat 

## fatigue,  an  appetite  suppressant  and  a  treatment  of  narcolepsy, adverse  effects  such  as  anorexia,  weight  loss  and  insomnia  are predictable and  frequent adverse  events associated  with the  use of amphetamine-based  medications  in  the  management  of  ADHD. These  side ef fects ha ve been  reported fo r (/-amphetamine  (James et  al.,  2001;  Pelham  et  al.,  1990;  Winsberg  et  al.,  1974)  MESamphetamine  (Goodman  et  al.,  2005;  James  et  al.,  2001;  Pelham et  al.,  1999;  Wigal  et  al.,  2005)  and  lisdexamfetamine  (Adler et  al.,  2008;  Biederman  et  al.,  2007a,b;  Findling  et  al.,  2008; Weisler et al., 2009). O ther adverse events  evoked by the  amphet­ amines  include  nausea,  vomiting,  abdominal  cramps,  increases  in blood pressure and  heart rate and  possibly also the  exacerbation of motor  tics  (Adler  et  al.,  2008;  Biederman  et  al.,  2007a,b;  Findling et  al.,  2008;  Goodman  et  al.,  2005;  James  et  al.,  2001;  Pelham et  al.,  1990,  1999;  Weisler  et  al.,  2009;  Wigal  et  al.,  2005; Winsberg et al., 1974).

**Abuse liability**

## Stimulants  have  a  tendency  to  be  liked  by  a  certain  proportion  of the  population,  though  not  by  everyone  by  any  means.  There  is 

some  evidence  that  basal  dopamine  tone  determines  this,  with people  who  have  a  higher  number  of  dopamine  D2  receptors  as measured by [’’Cj-raclopride positron emission tomography

(PET)  finding  the  stimulants  aversive  rather  than  pleasurable (Volkow  et  al.,  1999a).  However,  a  pleasurable  experience  from cZ-amphetamine can lead to excessive use of it as a prescribed drug by  the  patient  and  the  (mis)use  of  the  prescription  by  others (diversion). For  these reasons,  all current  amphetamine-type stim­ ulant  treatments  are  Controlled  Drugs  under  the  UK  Misuse  of Drugs  Act  1971,  with  all  members  of  being  placed  in  Class  B except  methamphetamine,  which  was  recently  placed  into  Class  A

#### wanting  empowerment  from  medication,  etc.  For  these  reasons, observations of  dependence and  abuse of  prescription d-amphetamine  are  rare  in  clinical  practice,  and  this  stimulant  can  even  be prescribed  to  people  with  a  history  of  drug  abuse  provided  certain controls,  such  as  daily  pick-ups  of  prescriptions,  are  put  in  place (Jasinski and Krishnan, 2009b).

It  is  well  known  that  recreational  drug  abusers  and  dependent users  generally  administer  psychostimulants  at  doses  several-fold higher  than  those  stipulated  for  therapeutic  use.  Furthermore,  to achieve  its  greatest  pharmacological  effect,  the  maximum  quan­ tity of  drug must  be delivered  into the  CNS in  the shortest  possible time.  It  is  this  imperative  which  causes  drug  abusers  to  progress from  relatively  safe  methods  of  self-administration,  such  as  oral ingestion,  onto  increasingly  dangerous  routes,  for  example  snort­ ing  cocaine,  smoking  (‘crack’  cocaine  or  ‘crystal  meth’)  or  intra­ venous  injection.  Another  less  well-recognised  factor  in  drug abuse is  a desire  of users  for instant  gratification. Thus,  the appeal of  a  particular  drug  as  a  recreational  substance  of  abuse  is  to  a large  extent  determined  by  its  ability  to  produce  its  desired  effects within minutes, for example the cocaine ‘rush’.

The  kinetics  of  rf-amphctaminc  when  taken  orally  make  it  less rewarding  (pleasurable)  than  cocaine  or  methamphetamine. Cocaine,  whether  snorted  or  smoked  as  ‘crack’  in  particular, enters the  brain very  quickly, and  appears even  to be  concentrated in  the  brain  relative  to  plasma;  this  explains  the  high  rewarding potential  of  this  drug:  faster  brain  entry  leads  to  a  greater  ‘high’. Methamphetamine  enters  more  slowly  and  its  peak  effects  are delayed  by  10-15  min  compared  with  cocaine  (Fowler  et  al., 2008).  Although  (/-amphetamine  sulphate  has  not  been  studied  in an  exactly  comparable  way,  we  can  predict  from  its  physico­ chemical  properties  that  after  oral  ingestion  (/-amphetamine would  have  even  slower  rate  of  uptake  into  the  brain  than  meth­ amphetamine.  Having  said  that,  the  abuse  of  (/-amphetamine  is not  a  cause  for  complacency.  Although  amphetamine  abuse peaked  in t he 1 960s  (Rasmussen,  2008),  the misuse  of ampheta­ mine  is  a  persistent  social,  legal  and  medical  problem  (DasDouglas  et  al.,  2008).  The  intravenous  use  of  (/-amphetamine  and other  stimulants  still  pose  major  safety  risks  to  the  individuals indulging  in  this  practice  (Chamaud  and  Griffiths,  1998;  DasDouglas  et  al.,  2008;  Kall  and  Olin,  1990;  Leino  et  al.,  1997). 

Some  of  this  intravenous  abuse  is  derived  from  the  diversion  of ampoules  of  (/-amphetamine,  which  are  still  occasionally  pre­

scribed  in  the  UK  for  the  control  of  severe  narcolepsy  and  other disorders  of  excessive  sedation.  However,  most  intravenous (/-amphetamine  use  is  from  local  illicit  production.  Some  abusers will  use  solvents  to  extract  the  active  ingredient  from  tablets  or capsules,  which  can  then  be  concentrated  and  injected  intrave­ nously.  The  development  of  tamper-deterrent  (/-amphetamine  for­ mulations  has  been  a  major  objective  of  the  pharmaceutical industry  to  prevent  this  type  of  abuse.  Several  new  once-daily rf-amphctaminc-containing  prescription  drugs  have  emerged that  have  a  high  degree  of  tamper  deterrence,  for  example Adderall  XR.  In  addition,  lisdexamfetamine  as  a  prodrug  of (/-amphetamine,  is  a  further  advance  in  reducing  diversion  risk since it  provides a  more gradual  increase in  brain drug  concentra­ tion,  thereby  further  reducing  the  pleasurable  effects  of  the (/-amphetamine. These topics will be revisited later in this review.

Volkow  and  colleagues  have  performed  an  enormous  body  of research using  PET and  other brain  imaging techniques  to explore the  relationship  between  DAT  occupancy,  synaptic  dopamine 

concentration  and  dopamine  D2  receptor  occupancy  for  psycho­

stimulant  drugs  of  abuse.  Although  the  dopamine  release  hypoth­

esis  of  drug  reinforcement  proposed  by  Di  Chiara  and  Imperato 

(1988) based  on experiments  performed in  rats and  then extended 

in  humans  by  Volkow  and  colleagues  (1997,  1999a)  has  its  limi­

tations,  it  is  now  well  accepted  that  euphoria,  psychostimulation 

and  reinforcement  produced  by  stimulant  drugs  occur  when  there 

are  rapid  and  substantial  increases  in  the  synaptic  concentrations 

of  dopamine  in  the  basal  striatum  and  mesolimbic  system  of  the 

human  brain.  These  researchers  have  also  demonstrated  that  the 

rate  of  DAT  occupancy b y d rugs su ch  as  cocaine  and methylphe­

nidate  is  critical  to  their  ability  to  produce  ‘highs’  in  human  sub­

jects  (Volkow  and  Swanson,  2003;  Volkow  et  al.,  1996a,b,  1997, 

1999a,b).  Although  (/-amphetamine  is  a  competitive  substrate  for 

DAT  rather  than  a  classical  reuptake  inhibitor,  these  same  princi­

ples  apply  to  its  pharmacological  action.  Thus,  the  rate  and  mag­

nitude  of  neuronal  dopamine  release  produced  by  amphetamine 

is  absolutely  dependent  on t he  rate  and  concentration  of  drug  that 

reaches DAT  sites in  the brain  (Heal et  al., 2008,2009).  There has 

been  little  research  conducted  in  humans  on  this  kinetic  course 

using brain imaging, but it seems likely that the same rules apply.

Consistent  with  the  findings  in  microdialysis  experiments, 

(/-amphetamine  has  greater  potency  than  /-amphetamine  to  evoke 

stimulant-like  subjective  effects  in  rats  (Schechter,  1978)  and 

behavioural  activation  in  primates  (Scraggs  and  Ridley,  1978). 

Cross-generalisation  occurs  between  the  subjective  cues  evoked 

by  amphetamine’s d-  and  /-isomers,  indicating  a  common  neuro­

chemical  mechanism  (Schechter,  1978).  Both  amphetamine  iso­

mers  have  been  shown  to  serve  as  positive  reinforcers  in  animals 

(i.e.  animals  will  work  to  get  more  of  the  drug)  (Gilbert  and 

Cooper,  1983;  Risner,  1975;  Yokel  and  Pickens,  1973).  The  same 

is  true  for  human  subjects  (Smith  and  Davis,  1977;  Van  Kammen 

and  Murphy,  1975),  with  the  (/-isomer  once  again  being  two  to 

threefold  more  potent  than  the  /-isomer  (Risner,  1975;  Smith  and 

Davis,  1977; Van  Kammen and  Murphy, 1975 ; Yokel  and Pickens, 

1973).  On  the  basis  that  the  subjective  and  reinforcing  effects  of 

amphetamine’s  isomers  translate  well  from  animals  to  humans, 

and  with  the  assumption  that  the  neurochemical  mediators  are 

similarly  consistent  across  species,  we  can  employ  the  findings 

from  the  microdialysis  experiments  to  draw  some  conclusions  on 

this  subject.  The  results  in  Figure  4,  which  reveal  that  both  iso­

mers  are  equally  potent  noradrenaline  releasers,  but  rf-amphcta-

mine  is  around  threefold  more  potent  than  /-amphetamine  as  a 

dopamine releaser,  point to  dopamine as  the primary  neurochemi­

cal  mediator  of  amphetamine’s  stimulant  and  euphoriant  proper­

ties.  As  indicated  above,  it  is  the  combination  of  the  rapid  rate  of 

increase  and  magnitude  of  effect  that  accounts  for  the  powerful 

stimulant effects of amphetamine.

Although  /-amphetamine  is  the  less  potent  of  the  two  isomers, 

its  pharmacological  efficacy  should  not  be  underestimated. 

Cheetham et  al. (2007)  reported that  both isomers  were capable  of 

increasing  striatal  dopamine  efflux  by  >5000%  of  baseline  values, 

with  these  effects  reaching  a  maximum  within  around  45  min.  In 

contrast,  the  maximum  increases  in  dopamine  efflux  achieved  by 

classical  dopamine  reuptake  inhibitors  (e.g.  bupropion  and  GBR 

12909)  are  five  to  tenfold  smaller,  and  often  take  longer  than  an 

hour to  reach their  peak (Bredeloux et  al., 2007; De sai et al.,  2010; 

Nomikos  et  al.,  1989;  Sidhpura  et  al.,  2007;  Westerink  et  al., 

1987).  The  importance  of  the  rate  of  increase  of  synaptic  dopa­

mine  concentrations  to  the  induction  of  stimulation  and  euphoria

is  exemplified  by  the  observation  that  bupropion  and  GBR  12909 were  not  experienced  as  stimulant  or  euphoriant by  normal volun­ teers  (Hamilton  et  al.,  1983;  Peck  et  al.,  1979;  Sogaard  et  al., 

1990)  or  experienced  recreational  stimulant  users  (Griffith  et  al., 

1983;  Miller  and  Griffith,  1983).  In  those  bupropion  and GBR  12909  trials  where  rZ-amphetamine  was  employed  as  the positive  control,  its  stimulant,  energising  and  reinforcing  effects were  unequivocally  recognised  by  normal  subjects  and  recrea­ tional  drug  users  (Hamilton  et  al.,  1983;  Griffith  et  al.,  1983; Miller and Griffith, 1983; Peck et al., 1979).

**Once-daily formulations** In  previous  reviews,  we  have  extensively  described  the  efficacy 

## and  safety  of  stimulant  and  non-stimulant  drugs  used  in  the  man­ agement of  ADHD and  compared the  relative merits  of each  (Heal et  al.,  2009,2012).  This  analysis  has  revealed  that  the  stimulants, including  amphetamine,  are  still  accepted  to  be  the  most  effica­ cious  drugs  available.  Some  attempts  to  introduce  new  medica­ tions,  for  example  guanfacine  XR  (Intuniv®)  have  been successful, but  many other  new pharmacological  approaches have failed (see  Heal et  al., 2012).  On the  other hand,  the innovations  in formulation  technology  and  drug  delivery syst ems  have  made sig­ nificant  strides  forward  in  improving  the  clinical  management  of ADHD.  All  of  the  stimulants  have  biological  half-lives that  require  at  least  twice-daily  dosing  to  deliver  efficacy  over 

12-14  h.  ADHD  is  characterised  by  inattention,  distractibility, working  memory  deficits  and  impulsivity,  and  as  such,  subjects with  this  disorder  are  particularly  unsuited  to  compliance  with rigid  dosing  schedules.  Since  amphetamine  has  a  high  liability  for recreational  abuse,  placing  medicines  in  the  hands  of  children increases  the  risk  of  diversion/abuse,  whilst  the  alternative approach  of  putting  the  drugs  into  the  care  of  the  school  authori­ ties  carries  with  it  the  requirement  for  appropriate  facilities  for  the 

storage  of  Controlled  Drugs.  Administering  a  once-daily  stimulant medication to  a child  or adolescent  first thing  in the  morning under parental  supervision  relieves  him/her  of  the  requirement  to  take additional  medication  outside  of  the  home,  and  it  also  eliminates the  need  for  the  patient  to  take  additional  medication  within  strict time-windows.  One  of  the  additional  benefits  of  these  new  formu­ lations  is  their  tamper  deterrence,  making  it  difficult  for  abusers  to extract  amphetamine  for  self-administration  by  hazardous  routes, such  as  smoking,  ‘snorting’  or  intravenous  injection.  Examples  of once-daily  amphetamine  medications  include  MES-amphetamine XR and the cZ-amphetamine prodrug, lisdexamfetamine.

**Lisdexamfetamine** As  briefly  discussed  earlier  in  the  review,  lisdexamfetamine  is  the 

## first amphetamine  prodrug to  have been  approved for  use in  treat­ ing  ADHD.  Lisdexamfetamine  has  no  affinity  for  a  wide  panel  of transporters  including  DAT  and  NET  (Vyvanse®,  US  Product Label)  or  receptors,  ion  channels,  allosteric  binding  sites  and enzymes  (Table  3).  This  profile  is  consistent  with  lisdexamfeta­ mine  being  pharmacologically  inactive.  Although  there  is  no definitive  information  on  the  subject,  the  large  molecular  size  and polar  characteristics  of  lisdexamfetamine  predict  that  the  parent molecule  is  unlikely  to  cross  the  blood-brain  barrier.

sampling.  The  locomotor  activity  of  the  rats  was  also  simultane­

ously  monitored.  After  administration  of  equivalent  doses  of  lis­

dexamfetamine  and  IR  rZ-amphetamine  (1.5  mg/kg  ip  as 

rZ-amphetamine  base),  the  observed  plasma  PK  profiles  for  the 

pharmacologically  active  moiety,  cZ-amphetamine,  were  very  dif­

ferent.  The  AUC0.480  min  values  were  identical,  but  the  maximum 

concentration  reached  in  plasma  (the  Cmax)  was  50%  lower  after 

administration  of  lisdexamfetamine  and  the  time  to  Cmax 

(the  t max)  was  doubled  (Jackson  et  al.,  2011).  These  observations 

are  entirely  consistent  with  the  postulated  rate-limited  enzymatic 

conversion  of  lisdexamfetamine  to  cZ-amphetamine.  This  differ­

ence  in  PK  characteristics  had  a  profound  impact  on t he p harma­

cological  effects  of  these  two  compounds  in  rats  (Figure  5). 

Lisdexamfetamine  produced  a  gradual  and  sustained  increase  in 

striatal  dopamine  efflux,  whereas  the  increase  produced  by  IR 

iZ-amphetamine was faster in onset, reaching a peak at 30 min, and 

it subsequently declined more rapidly (Figure 5).

rZ-Amphetamine’s effects  on striatal  dopamine efflux  and loco­

motor  activity  are  superimposable  (Figure  5),  that  is,  the  rapid 

release of dopamine  translates directly  into an immediate  and sub­

stantial increase  of locomotor  activity. In  the case  of lisdexamfeta­

mine,  the  more g radual a nd su stained in crease  in dopa mine efflux 

was  associated  with  a  much  smaller  and  visibly  delayed  locomo­

tor response.  Using a  hysteresis analysis  to define  the relationship 

between the  ascending and  descending compo nents of  a concen­

tration-time  curve  for  extracellular  dopamine  concentration  in  the 

striatum and the functional response (locomotor activity),

the  relationship  was  anticlockwise  for  lisdexamfetamine,  but clockwise f or IR  cZ-amphetamine (p < 0.05)  (Rowley et  al., 2011 ). Using  the  hysteresis  analysis  in  a  more  conventional  way  to explore  the  relationship  between  the  plasma  concentration  of cZ-amphetamine and the functional response, there was a clear dif­ ference  between  the  two  compounds  with  an  anticlockwise  hys­ teresis  for  lisdexamfetamine  and  no  hysteresis  for  IR cZ-amphetamine  (Rowley  et  al.,  2011).  The  anticlockwise  hyster­ esis  shows  that  the  functional  effect  of  lisdexamfetamine  was greater as the plasma concentration of cZ-amphetamine was falling, whilst  the  lack  of  hysteresis  with  IR  rf-amphetamine  demonstrates that  as  soon  as  the  plasma  concentration  of  the  drug  starts  to decline, so does its pharmacological effect.

The  clinical  importance  of  these  findings  will  be  discussed  in the following section.

**Implications of pharmacokinetics of** 

## **lisdexamfetamine for efficacy, safety** **and recreational abuse liability** The  efficacy  of  lisdexamfetamine  has  been  demonstrated  in  a 

## number  of  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  clinical trials  in  ADHD  in  children,  adolescents  (Biederman  et  al., 2007a,b;  Lopez  et  al.,  2008;  Wigal  et  al.,  2009)  and  adults  (Adler et  al.,  2008,  2009;  Wigal  et  al.,  2010a).  Since  lisdexamfetamine has  been  the  subject  of  several  reviews  (Dew  and  Kollins,  2010; Heal  et  al.,  2009,2012;  Howland,  2008;  Madaan,  2008;  Mattingly, 2010;  Najib,  2009),  we  will  focus  on  the  probable  contribution  of lisdexamfetamine’s  special PK/PD  profile to  its eff icacy as  a treat ­ ment  for  ADHD  and  its  potential  for  lower  recreational  abuse/ dependence than amphetamine.

Biederman  et  al.  (2007a)  published  results  from  the  only  clini­

cal  trial  where  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  lisdexamfetamine  in 

ADHD  was  compared  directly  against  another  clinically  proven 

drug,  MES-amphetamine  XR.  Following  a  3-week,  open-label 

run-in  period  where  the  dose  of  MES-amphetamine  XR  was  opti­

mised  to  10,  20  or  30  mg  once  a  day,  subjects  were  then  ran­

domised  into  a  3-way  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  crossover 

trial.  They  received  their  optimal  dose  of  MES-amphetamine  XR, 

an  equivalent  dose  of  lisdexamfetamine  in  terms  of  d-ampheta-

mine  base,  or  placebo.  On  the  primary  and  secondary  efficacy 

variables  of  behaviour,  attention  and  problem  solving,  lisdexam­

fetamine  delivered  equivalent  or  better  efficacy  than  MES-

amphetamine  XR  with  both  drugs  being  maximally  effective  at 

2  h  post-dose  (Biederman  et  al.,  2007a).  However,  on  the  prob­

lem-solving  endpoints,  it  was  also  evident  that  lisdexamfetamine 

maintained its  maximum effect  for at  least 12  h, whereas  the effect 

of  MES-amphetamine  XR  showed  a  clear  decline  after  6-8  h 

(Biederman  et  al.,  2007a).  An  exceptionally  long  duration  of 

effect  of  lisdexamfetamine  was  observed  by  Wigal  et  al.  (2009, 

2010b),  who  reported  that  significant  improvements  in  deport­

ment  and  attention  in  children  with  ADHD  were  observed  as  early 

as  1  h  after  lisdexamfetamine  administration,  with  its  efficacy  on 

behaviour,  attention  and  problem  solving  maintained  for  up  to 

13 h.  A post-hoc  analysis of  the data also  showed that the  sex and 

age  of  the  subjects  had  no  significant  influence  on  the  efficacy  of 

lisdexamfetamine (Wigal et al., 2010b).

These  observations  fit  well  with  the  PD  profile  of  lisdexamfe­

tamine  in  the  microdialysis  experiments.  Thus,  a  dose  of  lisdexa­

mfetamine  that  produced  only  a  small  increase  in  locomotor 

activity  evoked  >500%  enhancement  of  striatal  dopamine  efflux 

that  was  maintained  for  at  least  6  h  (Figure  5).  PK  studies  in 

human subjects  have revealed  the t„,.ix of  plasma <Z-amphetamine

occurs  around  3  h  after  taking  lisdexamfetamine;  thereafter, plasma (/-amphetamine  declines such  that at  12 h its  concentration has  fallen  to  around  60%  of  the  Cmax  (Krishnan  and  Stark,  2008; Krishnan  et  al.,  2008).  The  maintenance  of  therapeutic  effect  in ADHD  when  plasma  (/-amphetamine  concentrations  are  declining indicates  that  the  anticlockwise  hysteresis  observed  in  the  preclinical  PK/PD  experiments  probably  also  applies  to  its  clinical efficacy. Another way  to p roduce a  more gentle  increase of  brain dopa­ mine  is  to  bind  (/-amphetamine  to  a  support.  MES-amphetamine XR  employs  a  bead  technology  to  deliver  two  bolus  doses  of amphetamine,  the  first  immediately  and  the  second  approximately 4  h  later,  giving  a  Cmax  for  amphetamine’s d-  and  /-isomers  6-8  h (Adderall  XR®,  US  Product  Label).  Therefore,  the  maximum therapeutic  effect  of  MES-amphetamine  XR  (Biederman  et  al., 2007a)  coincided  almost  exactly  with  the  tm,lx  for  plasma (/-amphetamine  (Adderall  XR®,  US  Product  Label).  These  find­ ings  are  also  consistent  with  the  preclinical  PK/PD  relationship for  1R  (/-amphetamine  that  found  a  lack  of  hysteresis  between plasma (/-amphetamine  concentration and  the functional  response, that is, locomotor activity. Another  factor  that  almost  certainly  contributes  to  the  consist­ ently  high  level  of  therapeutic  efficacy  observed  with  lisdexamfe­ tamine  treatment  is  the  very  low  inter-  and  intra-subject  variability in  the  plasma  concentration  of  (/-amphetamine  observed  after administration  of  the  prodrug  compared  with  traditionally  formu­ lated  stimulants,  including  beaded  and  osmotic-release  formula­ tions.  Once  again,  the  reproducible  pharmacokinetics  of  its  active metabolite,  (/-amphetamine,  are  probably  due  to  the  rate-limited, enzymatic  cleavage  of  the  precursor  molecule  that  occurs  primar­ ily in red blood cells (Ermer et al., 2010). In  two  earlier  published  studies,  Jasinski  and  Krishnan  com­ pared the subjective effects of  lisdexamfetamine and 1R (/-amphet­ amine  in  drug-experienced  human  volunteers  when  these compounds  were  administered  intravenously  (Jasinski  and Krishnan,  2009a)  and  orally  (Jasinski  and  Krishnan,  2009b).  In the  trial  where  they  compared  these  compounds  after  oral  admin­ istration,  1R  (/-amphetamine  (40  mg  (29.6  mg  (/-amphetamine base))  evoked  a  statistically  significant  increase  relative  to  pla­ cebo  in  ‘Drug  liking’  on  the  Drug  Rating  Questionnaire  -  Subject (DQRS)  scale,  whereas  the  equivalent  dose  of  lisdexamfetamine (100  mg,  oral)  did  not  (Jasinski  and  Krishnan,  2009b). Furthermore,  the  time  of  lisdexamfetamine’s  peak  pharmacologi­ cal  effect  was  substantially  delayed  compared  with  1R  (/-amphet­ amine,  at  3.0  h  versus  1.5-2.0  h.  When  lisdexamfetamine  was given at  an increased  dose of  150 mg,  it significantly  increased the DQRS ‘Drug  liking’ score  to an  equivalent extent  to 1R  (/-amphet­ amine (40  mg oral).  However, the  peak effect  of the  higher dose  of lisdexamfetamine was even more delayed, at 4.0 h. When  the  intravenous  route  was  explored,  IR  (/-amphetamine (20  mg  intravenous)  produced  a  peak  ‘Drug  liking’  score  20  min after  dosing,  which  coincided  with  plasma  Cmax  (Jasinsky  and Krishnan, 2009b).  In contrast,  the equivalent  dose of  lisdexamfeta­ mine  (50  mg  intravenous)  did  not  significantly  increase  ‘Dug  lik­ ing’  relative  to  placebo,  and  the  Cm,lx  of  plasma  (/-amphetamine occurred considerably later at 2.0 h  (Jasinski and Krishnan, 2009b). Both compounds yielded equivalent  AUC0.24h values, but compared with the  equivalent dose  of IR  (/-amphetamine, the  Cmax for  plasma (/-amphetamine was threefold  smaller for lisdexamfetamine  and the tmax  was  threefold  greater  (Jasinski  and  Krishnan,  2009b).  These differences  in  the  PK  and  PD  characteristics  of  IR  (/-amphetamine 

and lisdexamfetamine observed in humans by Jasinski and Krishnan (2009b) are very similar  to the results from  the rat PK/PD study  that are  described  earlier  in  this  review  (Jackson  et  al.,  2011;  Rowley et al., 2011).

From  these  results,  it  can  be  concluded  that  although  in  terms of  (/-amphetamine  base  equivalents  lisdexamfetamine  is  clearly less  potent  than  IR  (/-amphetamine,  it  does  nonetheless  produce (/-amphetamine-like  subjective  effects  in  man.  It  is  also  reasona­ ble to  assume that  if the  intravenous dose  of lisdexamfetamine  had been  increased,  its  ‘Drug  liking’  effect  would  have  separated  from placebo.  However,  when  considering  any  drug’s  potential  for recreational  abuse,  the  time  required  for  it  to  produce  its  peak response  is  likely  to  be a s i mportant a s i ts mag nitude.  In  the  case of  IR  (/-amphetamine,  its  maximum  subjective  effect  occurred much  earlier  than  lisdexamfetamine,  and  switching  to  the  intrave­ nous  route  speeded  up  IR  (/-amphetamine’s  onset  of  action  and increased its  potency. Although  increasing the  dose of  lisdexamfe­ tamine  enhanced  its  efficacy,  it  also  progressively de layed it s  time of  peak  effect.  Furthermore,  switching  to  the  intravenous  route  for lisdexamfetamine  appeared  to  have  relatively  little  influence  on the abuse potential of the prodrug.

To  explore  this  possibility  further,  we  performed  a  post-hoc analysis  on  the  data  in  the  original  clinical  study  reports (Jasinski,  2005,  NRP104.A02;  Jasinski,  2006,  NRP104.A03) to  compare  pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacokinetics  of  lis­ dexamfetamine  when  given  by  the  clinical  route  (oral)  versus one  of  those  favoured  by  recreational  abusers  (intravenous). This  topic  is  of  particular  importance  because  lisdexamfeta­ mine  has  very  high  aqueous  solubility,  making  the  prodrug very  easy  to  extract.  In  fact,  breaking  the  capsule  open  and dissolving  the  contents  in  water  is  stated  as  a  dosing  route  for patients  who  are  unable  to  swallow  capsules  (Vyvanse®,  US Product Label).

As  shown  in  Table  4,  the  average  maximum  scores  on  the DQRS  and  Drug  Rating  Questionnaire  -  Observer  (DRQO)  scales for ‘Liking’, ‘Feel drug effect’, and ‘Disliking’ reveal

#### that  the  subjective  effects  of  lisdexamfetamine  (50  mg)  were  not 

significantly  different  when  the  prodrug  was  administered  orally  or intravenously.  This  result  shows  that  the  subjective  effects  of  lis­ dexamfetamine were not  enhanced when the  drug was given  intra­ venously.  Blood  pressure  measurements  are  useful  objective measures  of  the  PD  effects  of  sympathomimetic  drugs.  Compared with  placebo,  50  mg  lisdexamfetamine  significantly  increased  the peak  systolic  blood  pressure  when  administered  both  orally  and intravenously  and  diastolic  blood  pressure  when  given  orally (Figure 6). What  is also evident  from the data  in Figure 6  is that the magnitude  of  increases  in  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures was  not  statistically  different  after  oral  or  intravenous  administra­ tion of lisdexamfetamine.

The  PK  parameters  for  plasma  ^/-amphetamine  observed  after oral  versus  intravenous  administration  of  lisdexamfetamine  (50 mg)  are  also  summarised  in  Table  4.  The  AUC0.inflnity  shows  that the  overall  drug  exposure  was  identical  irrespective  of  the  route  of administration.  Importantly,  intravenous  injection  of  lisdexamfet­ amine  did  not  either  significantly  increase  the  Cmax  of  d-amphetamine,  nor  did  it  significantly  reduce  its  t„,.lx.  Although  the  AUC0. oh indicated that  early exposure  to (/-amphetamine  was reduced  after oral  administration  of  lisdexamfetamine,  this  difference  is  proba­ bly  explained  by  the  fact  that  intravenous  dosing  route  bypasses the time  taken for  the prodrug  to be  absorbed from  the gut  into the bloodstream prior enzymatic hydrolysis by red blood cells.

These  findings  strengthen  the  view  that  the  unusual  mecha­ nism  for  metabolic  conversion  of  lisdexamfetamine  to  d-amphetamine  has  important  implications  for  its  liability  for  recreational abuse. The  subjective effects  of a  50 mg  dose of  lisdexamfetamine were  identical  in  magnitude  when  the  prodrug  was  administered ==== orally  or  by  intravenous  injection,  demonstrating  that  intravenous injection  did  not  enhance  the  pharmacological  potency  of  lisdexa­ mfetamine  in  the  CNS.  The  increases  in  systolic  and  diastolic blood  pressures  after  oral  or  by  intravenous  administration  of  lis­ dexamfetamine  were  also  identical,  confirming  by  objective  and quantifiable  physiological  measures  that  the  intravenous  injection route  did not  enhance its  pharmacological p otency. These  conclu­ sions  were  supported  by  the  PK  results  showing  that  the  AUC, Cmax  and  tmax  were  not  influenced  by  lisdexamfetamine’s  route  of administration.

These  results  are  complemented  by  those  of  Ermer  et  al. (2011),  who  reported  that  the  PK  profiles  were  identical  when lisdexamfetamine  was  administered  intranasally  or  orally, indicating  that  attempts  to  increase  its  potential  for  recrea­ tional  abuse  by  ‘snorting’  would  similarly  be  futile.  Although the  findings  do  not  demonstrate  that  lisdexamfetamine  lacks any  potential  for  recreational  abuse,  they  do  indicate  that  its attractiveness  to  abusers  will  be  reduced  compared  with 1R  (/-amphetamine.  Based  on  these  data,  the  likelihood  that lisdexamfetamine  will  be  widely  abused  by  the  intravenous  or nasal route is very low.

**Conclusions** ft  is  now  just  over  a  hundred  years  since  amphetamine  was  first 

## discovered.  In  that  period  amphetamine  has  transformed  from  a drug  that  was  widely  available  without  prescription  for  the  treat­ ment  of  a  broad  range  of  disorders  to  being  highly  restricted Controlled Drugs  that, in Europe  at least,  have all  but disappeared from  the  formularies  in  many  countries.  The  very  clear  links between  molecular  structure  and  pharmacological  mode  of  action 

and, in  turn, efficacy  and safety  in humans,  makes amphetamine  a 

textbook  example  of  translational  validity.  The  primary  pharma­

cology  of  these  drugs  is  not  only  responsible  for  providing  effi­

cacy  in  disorders su ch  as ADHD  and narco lepsy, but  also for  their 

spectrum  of  adverse  events  and  liability  for  recreational  abuse, 

making  the  balance  of  benefit/risk  the  key  challenge  in  their  clini­

cal  use.  Amphetamine  ranks  alongside  methylphenidate  as  the 

most  effective  drugs  available  for  the  management  of  ADHD,  and 

the  advances  that  have  been  made  in  developing  genuine  once-

daily  medications  have  addressed  some  of  the  problems o f t hera­

peutic  coverage,  whilst  at  the  same  time  reducing  the  risk  of 

diversion and recreational abuse.
