COMMENT.  The  differentiating  factors  for  ADEM  and  MS  outlined  above  are  useful when  considered  as  a  group  of  presenting  characteristics,  but  individually  their  value  is limited.  In  an  analysis  of  initial  MRI  findings  predictive  of  a  second  attack  of  acute  CNS inflammatory  demyelination  in  116  children,  Mikaeloff  et  al  found  that  the  risk  of  MS  was significantly  higher  in  patients  with  corpus  callosal  lesions,  whereas  basal  ganglia  lesions were  equally  frequent  in  monophasic  (ADEM)  and  recurrent  (MS)  disease **(Brain** 2004;127:1942-1947; **Ped  Neur  Briefs** 2004;18:65-66).  Tenembaum  et  al  (2002)  found relapses  and  MS  in  10%  cases  initially  diagnosed  as  ADEM;  residual  disability  was  not related  to  MRI  findings  at  onset,  but  it  was  correlated  with  the  occurrence  of  optic  neuritis **(Ped Neur Briefs** 2002; 16:81).

### **ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER** **LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF ADDERALL XR IN ADHD**

## The  long-term  tolerability  and  effectiveness  of  extended  release  mixed  amphetamine salts  (Adderall  XR)  in  children  with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  were evaluated  in  a  24-month,  multicenter,  open-label  extension  of  2  placebo-controlled  studies  at UCLA,  Massachusetts  General  Hospital,  UC-Irvine,  Maitland,  FL,  and  Shire  Pharmaceutical, Wayne,  PA.  The  initial  dose  of  Adderall  XR  was  10  mg  daily  in  568  children,  aged  6-12 years,  and  was  increased  by  10  mg  weekly  to  optimal  effective  levels  (maximum  30  mg/d). Quarterly  Conners  Global  Index  Scale,  Parent  version  (CGIS-P)  was  used  to  assess effectiveness,  and  adverse  events,  physical  examinations,  and  laboratory  tests  were monitored  to  assess  tolerability.  Significant  improvements  (>30%,  p<0.001)  in  CGIS-P scores were  maintained through  the trial,  and treatment  was generally  well tolerated.  Adverse events  (AE)  included  headache  (15%),  anorexia  (15%),  and  insomnia  (11%);  15%  withdrew from  the  study  because  of  AE  (weight  loss,  anorexia,  insomnia,  depression,  and  emotional lability).  Serious  AE  were  reported  in  18  subjects  (3%);  only  2,  both  convulsions,  were judged  possibly  drug-related,  at  doses  of  10  and  20  mg/d.  None  required  subsequent treatment  with  anticonvulsants.  Mean  systolic  blood  pressure  increased  by  3.5  mmHg, diastolic  by  2.6  mmHg,  pulse  by  3.4  beats  per  min.  (Changes  in  vital  signs,  ECG,  and cardiovascular-related AEs  to be  reported later).  (McGough JJ,  Biederman J,  Wigal SB  et al. Tnno-terrn  tolerab'litv  and  effectiveness  of  once-daiâ€™y  mixed  amphetamine  salts  (Adderall XR)  in  children  with  ADHD. **J  Am  Acad  Child  Adolescent  Psychiatry** June  2005;44:530538).

COMMENT.  This  paper  is  something  of  a  cliff-hanger.  The  promise  of  a  second installment  in  a  subsequent  publication  is  frustrating.  The  effectiveness  and  general tolerability  of  Adderall  XR  is  well  known,  but  answers  to  the  concerns  regarding cardiovascular events are anxiously awaited. Hopefully, we can expect this report soon.

**Atomoxetine-induced  blood  pressure  increase.** A  significant  elevation  in  blood pressure  is  noted  in  3  adolescent  boys  while  taking  doses  of  80  mg/day  atomoxetine 

(Dworkin  N. **J  Am  Acad  Child  Adolesc  Psychiatry** June  2005;44:510).  Other  drugs  were given  in  combination,  compromising  the  significance  of  the  report,  but  our  own  practice  of monitoring BP, pulse, height, and weight regularly in ADHD patients will be continued.
