**ABSTRACT** **Background** Few  studies  examined  treatments  for  amphetamine  withdrawal,  although  it  is  a  common  problem  among  amphetamine  users.  Its symptoms,  in  particular  intense  craving,  may  be  a  critical  factor  leading  to  relapse  to  amphetamine  use.  In  clinical  practice,  medications for  cocaine  withdrawal  are  commonly  used  to  manage  amphetamine  withdrawal  although  the  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic properties of these two illicit substances are different. **Objectives** To  assess  the  effectiveness  of  pharmacological  alone  or  in  combination  with  psychosocial  treatment  for  amphetamine  withdrawals  on discontinuation rates, global state, withdrawal symptoms, craving, and other outcomes. **Search methods** MEDLINE  (1966  -  2008),  CINAHL  (1982  -  2008),  PsycINFO  (1806  -  2008),  CENTRAL  (Cochrane  Library  2008  issue  2),  references of obtained articles. **Selection criteria** All  randomised  controlled  and  clinical  trials  evaluating  pharmacological  and  or  psychosocial  treatments  (alone  or  combined)  for  people with amphetamine withdrawal symptoms. **Data collection and analysis** Two  authors  evaluated  and  extracted  data  independently.  The  data  were  extracted  from  intention-to-treat  analyses.  The  Relative  Risk 

(RR)  with  the  95%  confidence  interval  (95%  CI)  was  used  to  assess  dichotomous  outcomes.  The  Weighted  Mean  Difference  (WMD) with 95% CI was used to assess continuous outcomes. **Main results** Four  randomised  controlled  trials  (involving  125  participants)  met  the  inclusion  criteria  for  the  review.  Two  studies  found  that amineptine  significantly  reduced  discontinuation  rates  and  improved  overall  clinical  presentation,  but  did  not  reduce  withdrawal symptoms  or  craving  compared  to  placebo.  The  benefits  of  mirtazapine  over  placebo  for  reducing  amphetamine  withdrawal  symptoms were  not  as  clear.  One  study  suggested  that  mirtazapine  may  reduce  hyperarousal  and  anxiety  symptoms  associated  with  amphetamine withdrawal.  A  more  recent  study  failed  to  find  any  benefit  of  mirtazapine  over  placebo  on  retention  or  on  amphetamine  withdrawal symptoms. **Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal (Review)** **Copyright© 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration.

**Authors’ conclusions** No  medication  is  effective  for  treatment  of  amphetamine  withdrawal.  Amineptine  showed  reduction  in  discontinuation  rates  and improvement  in  clinical  presentation  compared  to  placebo,  but  had  no  effect  on  reducing  withdrawal  symptoms  or  craving.  In  spite of  these  limited  benefits,  amineptine  is  not  available  for  use  due  to  concerns  over  abuse  liability  when  using  the  drug.  The  benefits of  mirtazapine  as  a  withdrawal  agent  are  less  clear  based  on  findings  from  two  randomised  controlled  trials:  one  report  showed improvements  in  amphetamine  withdrawal  symptoms  over  placebo;  a  second  report  showed  no  differences  in  withdrawal  symptoms compared  to  placebo.  Further  potential  treatment  studies  should  examine  medications  that  increase  central  nervous  system  activity involving dopamine, norepinephrine and/or serotonin neurotransmitters, including mirtazapine.

**PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY** **Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal** Symptoms  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  during  the  initial  days  of  abstinence  from  chronic  amphetamine  use  can  prompt  individuals  to return  to  regular  drug  use.  No  medications  demonstrate  significant  effects  over  placebo  in  reducing  symptoms  of  acute  amphetamine withdrawal.

#### Amphetamines  can  make  people  feel  more  alert,  and  are  prescribed  for  problems  like  depression  and  attention  deficit  order.  Am­ phetamines  can  produce  euphoria,  and  so  are  manufactured  for  recreational  use.  Ongoing  use  can  lead  to  dependence,  which  can  be  as hard  to  recover  from  as  dependence  on  heroin  or  cocaine.  The  only  randomized  trials  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  agents  have  been of  antidepressant  drugs  (amineptine  and  mirtazapine).  Amineptine  was  found  to  have  limited  benefits,  showing  improvement  only on  some  subjective  effects  but  is  no  longer  on  the  market  because  of  concerns  over  its  abuse  liability.  The  benefits  of  mirtazapine  have been  less  clear  based  on  two  randomised  controlled  trials,  with  one  showing  improvements  in  amphetamine  withdrawal  symptoms  and the other showing no differences in withdrawal outcomes when compared to placebo. More research is needed.

**BACKGROUND** Although  there  are  a  variety  of  amphetamines  and  amphetamine derivatives,  the  word  “amphetamines”  in  this  review  stands  for amphetamine, dextroamphetamine, and methamphetamine.

## **Description of the condition** When  chronic  heavy  users  abruptly  discontinue  amphetamine use,  many  report  a  time-limited  withdrawal  syndrome  that  occurs within  24  hours  of  their  last  dose.  Withdrawal  symptoms  are  suf­ ficiently severe  to cause  relapse to  drug use  in the  absence of  con­ tained  environments.  The  prevalence  of  this  withdrawal  syndrome 

## is  extremely  common (Cantwell  1998;  Gossop  1982) with  87.6% of647  individuals  with  amphetamine  dependence  reporting  six  or more  signs  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  listed  in  the  DSM  when the  drug  is  not  available (Schuckit  1999). The  DSM-IV-TR  cri­ teria  for  diagnosing  amphetamine  withdrawal  include  dysphoric mood  and  two  or  more  symptoms:  fatigue,  vivid  or  unpleasant 

dreams,  insomnia  or  hypersomnia,  increased  appetite  and  psy­

chomotor  agitation  or  retardation  that  occur  following  discontin­

uation  of  the  drug (DSM-IV-TR  2000). Clinically,  amphetamine 

dependent  individuals  in  acute  withdrawal  report  feeling  “severe 

dysphoria,  irritability  and  melancholia,  anxiety,  hypersomnia  and 

marked  fatigue,  intense  craving  for  the  drug  and  paranoia.”  Fac­

tor  analysis  of  withdrawal  symptoms  indicate  this  clinical  condi­

tion  may  be  comprised  of  three  factors (Srisurapanont  1999b): 

A  hyperarousal  factor  comprised  of  drug  craving,  agitation,  and 

vivid  or  unpleasant  dreams,  a  reversed  vegetative  factor  comprised 

of  decreased  energy,  increased  appetite,  and  increased  craving  for 

sleep,  and  an  anxiety  factor  comprised  loss  of  interest  or  pleasure, 

anxiety and slowing of movement.

The  experience  of  withdrawal  from  amphetamines  is  clinically  se­

vere  and  it  is  during  this  period  that  reports  of  suicidal  ideation  and 

attempts  are  noted (Meredith  2005;  Scott  2007). Amphetamine 

dependent  individuals  trying  to  discontinue  or  to  cut  down  use 

of  the  drug  using  self-help  or  even  formal  treatment  commonly 

relapse,  as  a  single  use  of am phetamine  immediately re moves d is­ **Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal (Review)** **Copyright© 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.**

comfort  and  institutes  a  sense  of  well-being  or  euphoria (Rawson 2002). As  the  initial  phase  of  treatment  requires  cessation  of use,  amphetamine  withdrawal  compromises  long-term  success  for some  individuals  with  severe  amphetamine  dependence  to  achieve protracted abstinence. The  severity  of  withdrawal  symptoms  is  greater  in  amphetamine dependent  individuals  who  are  older  and  who  have  more  exten­ sive  amphetamine  use  disorders (McGregor  2005). Withdrawal symptoms  typically  present  within  24  hours  of  the  last  use  of amphetamine,  with  a  withdrawal  syndrome  involving  two  gen­ eral  phases  that  can  last  3  weeks  or  more.  The  first  phase  of  this syndrome  is  the  initial  “crash”  that  resolves  within  about  a  week (Gossop  1982;  McGregor  2005). The  most  immediate  symptoms occur  during  this  “crash”  period  and  are  observed  to  resolve  dur­ ing  the  first  week  of  abstinence  measured  using  total  scores  of the  clinician  rated  Amphetamine  Withdrawal  Questionnaire,  the Amphetamine  Selective  Severity  Assessment  and  the  staff  rated Clinical  Global  Impressions (McGregor  2005). Severe  symptoms in  the  “crash”  phase  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  include  increases in  sleep  (averaging  2-3  hours  more  per  night  than  controls,  but with  poor  sleep  quality,  light  sleep,  frequent  awakening,  and  not feeling clearheaded on  arising), increases in  appetite, and decreases in  complaints  of  depression (McGregor  2005;  Newton  2004). A subacute,  protracted  set  of  withdrawal  symptoms  that  generally  re­ solve in  3 weeks  and that  are not  as well  defined, include  continued sleep  disturbances  (mild  hypersomnia  or  insomnia  and  continued increased  appetite (McGregor  2005;Gossop  1982). Although  the most  severe  symptoms  occurring  during  amphetamine  withdrawal resolve  in  a  week  or  less,  some  symptoms  may  continue  for  weeks or months (Watson 1972; Hofmann 1983).

**Description of the intervention** Symptoms  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  are  time  limited,  with most  resolving  in  a  week.  Thus,  a  treatment  for  amphetamine withdrawal  needs  rapid  onset.  In  clinical  practice  and  in  the  stud­ ies  reviewed,  treatment  is  started  as  soon  as  possible  following  the last  dose  of  amphetamine.  Medication  is  continued  for  up  to  two 

## weeks  to  provide  symptomatic  relief.  In  addition  to  medication, it  can  be  helpful  to  provide  psychosocial  and/or  behavioral  treat­ ments  for  stimulant  abuse  to  assist  the  patient  in  amphetamine withdrawal  in  sustaining  abstinence  from  amphetamine  once  their treatment  is  completed (Lee  2008). Following  brief  exposure  to the  treatment,  the  medication  is  discontinued  regardless  of  re­ sponse  as  there  is  no  evidence  to  suggest  a  pharmacotherapy  for amphetamine  withdrawal  would  have  efficacy  for  amphetamine abuse or dependence.

**How the intervention might work**

## One  rationale  guiding  selection  of  medications  for  amphetamine withdrawal  involves  using  a  medication  to  stabilize  dopamine, norepinephrine  or  serotonin  neurotransmission  to  provide  relief from  withdrawal  symptoms.  According  to  this  rationale,  the  neurobiology  of  the  amphetamine  withdrawal  syndrome  and  its  relief would  be  related  to  the  cumulative  effects  of  repeated  exposure of  neurons  to  high  dose  amphetamines (Meredith  2005). Initial 

“highs”  mediated  by  extracellular  dopamine  and  norepinephrine levels  in  striatum  (midbrain)  become  attenuated.  Aspects  of  the withdrawal  syndrome  may  be  mediated  by  different  neurotrans­ mitter  systems  that  include  dopamine,  norepinephrine  and  sero­ tonin.  Diminished  dopamine  synaptic  transmission  in  acute  with­ drawal  may  be  responsible  for  anhedonia  and  psychomotor  retar­ dation.  As  well,  decreased  synaptic  serotonin  availability  may  be the  substrate  for  depressed  mood,  obsessive  thoughts  about  the drug  and  lack  of  impulse  control (Rothman  2007). Medications that  acutely  stabilize  neurotransmission  in  these  systems  may  re­ lieve  acute  withdrawal  symptoms  and  assist  the  patient  in  estab­ lishing relevant periods of amphetamine abstinence.

**Why it is important to do this review** In  2006,  24.7  million  individuals  aged  15-64  consumed  am­ phetamine  type  stimulants (UNODC  2008). Among  chronic users  of  amphetamines,  evidence  is  accruing  to  describe  the  range of  public  health  problems  attributable  to  sustained  heavy  use  of  the drug.  Medical  consequences  of  chronic  use  of  amphetamines  in­

## clude  cardiovascular  insults,  cognitive  dysfunction  and  infectious disease (Meredith  2005;  Pasic  2007). Development  of  one  or  more medications  for  amphetamine  withdrawal,  particularly  if  imple­ mented  with  evidence-based  behavioral  or  counselling  interven­ tions,  would  have  great  public  health  significance.  Maintaining  a review  of  outcomes  from  experiences  using  medications  in  clinical trials  for  amphetamine  withdrawal  is  an  important  method  for clinicians  to  stay  current  and  to  seek  guidance  regarding  medica­ tion  strategies  when  treating  individuals  in  acute  withdrawal  from amphetamines.

**OBJECTIVES** To  assess  the  effectiveness  of  pharmacological  alone  or  in  combi­ nation  with  psychosocial  treatment  for  amphetamine  withdrawals on  discontinuation  rates,  global  state,  withdrawal  symptoms,  crav­ ing, and other outcomes.

**Types of studies** All relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and clinical con­ trolled trials (CCTs) were included.

#### **Types of participants** Individuals with amphetamine withdrawal, diagnosed by any set of criteria. Individuals experiencing withdrawal from other sub­ stances in addition to amphetamine withdrawal are included only if:

#### 1.  The data for amphetamine withdrawal are reported separately, or

2.  More than half of the participants are amphetamine withdrawal patients.

**Types of interventions** Experimental intervention: Any kind of pharmacological treat­ ment, alone or in combination with a psychosocial treatment Control intervention: Placebo or any kind of psychosocial treat­ ment alone

#### **Types of outcome measures**

#### **Primary outcomes**

1.  Discontinuation rate measured as number of participants who did not complete the treatment

2.  Average score in global state as measured by global psychiatric rating scales, e.g. Clinical Global Impression

3.  Average score in withdrawal symptoms as measured by withdrawal symptomology assessments, e.g. Amphetamine Withdrawal Questionnaire

4.  Average score in craving as measured by craving rating scales, e.g. Questionnaire for Evaluating Cocaine Craving and Related Responses, Visual Analog Scale, Brief Substance Craving Scale

5.  Patient satisfaction as measured by type and number of adverse events

**Secondary outcomes**

1.  Duration of adherence to treatment as measured by pill count or self-report adherence

2.  Death as measured by the number of reported mortality All outcomes were reported for the short term (4 weeks or 1 month), medium term (more than 4 weeks or 1 month to 12 weeks or 3 months), and long term (more than 3 months). If any outcome was assessed more than once in a particular term, only the results of the longest duration in that term were considered.

**Search methods for identification of studies**

## The  search  incorporated  a  number  of  methods  to  identify  com­

pleted and ongoing studies

**Electronic searches**

#### •  We originally searched the Cochrane Central Register of 

Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2000, 

issue 4, MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2000) and 

EMBASE (January 1980 to December 2000).

•  For this updated version we searched CENTRAL through 

2008, Issue 2 of The Cochrane Library, and MEDLINE, 

PsycINFO and CINAHL through to May 1, 2008. For details 

reeAppendix 1; Appendix 2; Appendix 3.

**Searching other resources**

#### We also searched:

•  the reference lists of all relevant papers to identify further 

studies.

•  some of the main electronic sources of ongoing trials 

(Current Controlled Trials -======http://www.controlled-trials.com/======, 

Clinical ====Trials.gov========, ==Trialsjournal.com======)

•  conference proceedings likely to contain trials relevant to 

the review.

We  contracted  investigators  seeking  information  about  unpub­

lished or incomplete trials.

All  searches  included  non-English  language  literature  and  studies 

with  English  abstracts  were  assessed  for  inclusion.  When  consid­

ered likely to meet inclusion criteria, studies were translated.

**Data collection and analysis**

## **Selection of studies**

#### In  the  original  review,  reports  identified  by  the  electronic  searches 

were  assessed  for  relevance.  Two  reviewers  (MS  &  NJ)  indepen­

dently  inspected  all  study  citations  identified  by  the  electronic 

searches  and  full  reports  of  the  studies  of  agreed  relevance  were 

obtained.  Where  disputes  arose  the  full  reports  were  acquired  for 

more  detailed  scrutiny.  The  reviewers  (MS  &  NJ)  then  indepen­

dently inspected all these full study reports.

For this  update of  the review,  one author  (UK) inspected  the search 

hits  by  reading  titles  and  abstracts.  Each  potentially  relevant  study 

located  in  the  search  was  obtained  in  full  text  and  assessed  for 

inclusion  independently  by  two  authors  (SS  &  UK).  Discrepancies 

were resolved by discussion between the authors.

The corresponding author was contacted if information necessary 

for the review was not available in the reports. **Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal (Review)** **Copyright© 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.**

**Data extraction and management** Data  were  extracted  independently  by  the  authors  onto  data  ex­ traction  forms.  Again,  if  disputes  arose,  these  were  resolved  either by  discussion  between  the  two  reviewers  or  the  correspondence author of the paper.

#### **Assessment of risk of bias in included studies** We  changed  the  criteria  to  assess  the  methodological  quality  of included  studies  to  conform  the  review  to  the  recommended methods  outlined  in  the  last  Cochrane  Handbook  for  Systematic Reviews  of  Interventions (Higgins  2008) and  to  the  request  of RevMan  5.  We  assessed  the  new  studies  included  in  the  updated version  and  we  reassessed  the  studies  already  included  in  the  old review  using  the  new  criteria.  The  new  criteria  were  based  on  the following  specific  domains:  sequence  generation,  allocation  con­ cealment,  blinding,  incomplete  outcome  data,  selective  outcome reporting  and  other  issues.  We  evaluated  the  included  studies  as follow: A.  Sequence generation was assessed for all outcomes. Studies were considered  at  low  risk  of  bias  if  they  provided  a  clear  method  of generating  an  allocation  sequence  to  produce  comparable  groups, i.e.  random  number  table,  computer  random  number  generator, coin  tossing,  shuffling  cards  or  envelopes,  throwing  dice.  Studies were  considered  at  high  risk  of  bias  if  they  used  some  systematic, non-random  approach,  i.e.  date  of  birth,  date  of  admission,  clinic record number, by clinician.

#### B.  Allocation  concealment  was  assessed  for  all  outcomes.  Studies were  considered  at  low  risk  of  bias  if  they  provided  adequate  al­ location  concealment,  i.e.  central  allocation  including  telephone, web-based,  and  pharmacy-controlled,  randomisation;  sequentially numbered  drug  containers  of  identical  appearance;  sequentially numbered,  opaque,  sealed  envelopes.  Studies  were  determined  at high  risk  of  bias  if  they  had  inadequate  allocation  concealment, i.e. using  an open  random allocation  schedule such  as a  list of  ran­ dom  numbers;  assignment  envelopes  were  used  without  appropri­ ate  safeguards  e.g.  if  envelopes  were  unsealed  or  non-opaque  or not  sequentially  numbered;  alternation  or  rotation;  date  of  birth; case record number; any other explicitly unconcealed procedure. C.  Blinding  of  participants,  personnel,  and  outcome  assessor was  considered  separately  for  objective  outcomes  (discontinuation rates)  and  subjective  outcomes  (global  state,  craving,  and  with­ drawal  symptoms).  For  discontinuation  rates,  we  judged  that  lack of blinding was unlikely to influence data collection. D.  Incomplete  outcome  data  were  considered  for  all  outcomes except  for  discontinuation  rates.  It  was  assessed  for  results  at  the end of the  study pe riod.  Studies  were considered  at low  risk of  bias if they adequately addressed missing data. E.  Selective  outcome  reporting  was  considered  for  all  outcomes except for discontinuation rates. Studies  were jud ged  to have unclear  risk of  bias if  there was  insuf­ ficient  information  to  permit  judgment  of  ’low’  or  ’high’  risk  of 

bias for each of the domains.

**Measures of treatment effect**

#### Other  than  raw  data  (e.g.  death),  the  outcomes  derived  from  only 

valid  scales  were  included  in  the  reviews.  In  this  review,  a  valid 

scale means a scale that has been published in a scientific journal.

**Assessment of heterogeneity**

#### Test  of  heterogeneity  is  important  to  check  whether  the  results  of 

studies  are  similar  within  each  comparison.  The  reviewers  checked 

whether  differences  between  the  results  of  trials  were  greater  than 

could be  expected by  chance alone. This  was done by  looking at the 

graphical  display  of  the  results  but  also  by  using  Chi  square  tests 

of  heterogeneity.  A  p-value  being  less  than  0.05  of  a  Chi-square 

test  was  indicated  the  significant  heterogeneity  of  a  data  set.  The 

statistical  methods  for  dealing  with  a  data  set  with  significant  and 

non  significant  heterogeneity  were  described  in  ’Data  synthesis’. 

In  addition,  the  causes  possibly  leading  to  the  significant  hetero­

geneity of a data set were discussed.

**Data synthesis**

#### Dichotomous  data:  The  Relative  Risk  (RR)  with  the  95%  confi­

dence  interval  (95%  CI)  was  used.  RR  is  the  ratio  of  risk  in  the 

intervention  group  to  the  risk  in  the  control  group.  The  risk  (pro­

portion,  probability  or  rate)  is  the  ratio  of  people  with  an  event  in 

a  group  to  the  total  in  the  group.  A  relative  risk  of  one  indicates  no 

difference  between  comparison  groups.  For  undesirable  outcomes 

a  RR  that  is  less  than  one  indicates  that  the  intervention  was  ef­

fective in reducing the risk of that outcome.

In  addition,  as  a  measure  of  efficacy,  the  number  needed  to  treat 

(NNT)  was  also  calculated.  The  reviewers  extracted  the  dichoto­

mous  data  on  an  intention-to-treat  basis  by  applying  the  following 

guidelines  to  analyse  data  from  included  studies:  (i)  the  analysis 

included  all  those  who  entered  the  trial;  and  (ii)  the  analysis  main­

tained  the  study  groups  according  to  the  original  randomisation 

procedure.  The  reviewers  assigned  people  lost  to  follow-up  to  the 

worst outcome.

Continuous  data:  The  Weighted  Mean  Difference  (WMD)  with 

95%  CI  was  used.  WMD  is  a  method  of  meta-analysis  used  to 

combine measures on continuous scales  (such as weight), where the 

mean, standard deviation  and sample size  in each group  are known. 

The  weight  given  to  each  study  (e.g.  how  much  influence  each 

study  has  on  the  overall  results  of  the  meta-analysis)  is  determined 

by  the  precision  of  its  estimate  of  effect  and,  in  the  statistical 

software  in  RevMan  and  CDSR,  is  equal  to  the  inverse  of  the 

variance.  This  method  assumes  that  all  of  the  trials  have  measured 

the outcome on the same scale.

For  the  studies  in  which  the  treatment  and/or  controlled  groups 

were  divided  into  subgroups  because  of  the  differences  of  con­

current  treatment,  the  continuous  data  of  the  subgroups  receiv­ **Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal (Review)** **Copyright© 2009 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.**

ing  more  rigorous  treatment,  e.g.,  higher  doses  of  drug  treatment, more intensive psychotherapy, were extracted. In  conducting  a  meta-analysis,  a  fixed  effect  model,  an  analysis that  ignores  the  between-study  variation,  can  give  a  narrower  con­ fidence  interval  than  a  random  effect  model.  It  is  generally  agreed that  the  fixed  effect  model  is  valid  as  a  test  of  significance  of  the overall  null  hypothesis  (i.e.  ’no  effect  in  all  studies’).  A  statistically significant  result  obtained  by  the  use  of  this  model  indicated  that there  is  an  effect  in  at  least  one  of  the  studies.  Because  of  these advantages,  the  fixed  effect  model  was  used  for  the  synthesis  of  a group  of  data  with  homogeneity.  Although  a  random  effect  model can  be  applied  for  the  synthesis  of  a  group  of  data  with  significant heterogeneity,  the  results  obtained  by  the  synthesis  of  this  group of data have to be interpreted with great caution. As  high  attrition  rate  would  affect  the  study  results,  the  studies with  the  attrition  rate  of  50%  or  higher  of  the  total  participants were excluded.

**Sensitivity analysis** Sensitivity  analysis  is  an  analysis  used  to  determine  how  sensitive the  results  of  a  study  or  systematic  review  are  to  changes  in  how it was  done. Sensitivity  analyses are  used to  assess how  robust the results  are  to  uncertain  decisions  or  assumptions  about  the  data and the methods that were used. The  reviewers  examined  whether  the  decision  to  include  the  data 

#### obtained  from  studies  in  which  most  (5O%-75%)  participants 

were  amphetamine  dependent  or  abuse  affected  the  results  of  re­

view. The sensitivity  analyses were done  by the inclusion an d exclu­

sion  of  the  data  obtained  from  these  studies.  If  both  analyses  point 

to  the  same  conclusion  in  the  respect  of  significant  heterogeneity 

of  data,  the  meta-analyses  including  the  data  obtained  from  these 

studies  were  taken  into  consideration.  Otherwise,  the  meta-anal­

yses  conducted  by  the  exclusion  of  the  data  obtained  from  these 

studies were considered.

**Figure I. Flow chart showing identification of trials**

#### **Included studies** Four  studies,  involving  125  participants,  met  the  inclusion  criteria for  this  review (see Characteristics  of  included  studies). In  total, 59  participants  received  treatment  for  amphetamine  withdrawal (37  amineptine,  22  mirtazapine)  compared  to 66  participants  who received placebo.

#### **Comparisons** Of  the  four  studies  that  met  the  inclusion  criteria,  two studies  compared  amineptine  with  placebo (Jittiwutikan  1997; Srisurapanont  1999b) and  two  studies  compared  mirtazapine  with placebo (Kongsakon  2005;  Cruickshank  2008). Amineptine  is  an atypical  tricyclic  antidepressant  that  selectively  inhibits  the  reup­ take  of  dopamine  and  norepinephrine.  Because  amineptine  has 

similar  mechanism  of  actions  as  amphetamines,  it  was  put  forth that  amineptine  could  help  to  relieve  amphetamine  withdrawal symptoms.  Mirtazapine,  a  noradrenergic  and  specific  serotoner­ gic  antidepressant,  was  also  hypothesized  to  help  reduce  metham­ phetamine  withdrawal  severity  by  blocking  the  presynaptic  alpha2  adrenergic  receptors  that  inhibit  the  release  of  norepinephrine and serotonin.

**Treatment setting** Of  the  four  studies  that  met  the  inclusion  criteria,  two  ( Jittiwutikan  1997,  Srisurapanont  1999b) were  conducted  at  a drug  dependence  treatment  center,  one (Kongsakon  2005) at  a probation  facility,  and  one (Cruickshank  2008) in  a  public  drug and alcohol outpatient clinic.

**Participant characteristics** The  participants  of  the  four  included  studies  were  mainly  males (110  males,  15  females).  In  two  studies (Jittiwutikan  1997, Srisurapanont  1999b), participants  were  inpatients  at  a  drug  de­ pendence  treatment  center  who  met  DSM-IV  criteria  for  am­ phetamine  withdrawal.  In  the Srisurapanont  1999b study,  par­ ticipants  had  to  meet  the  additional  criteria  of  having  an  Am­ phetamine  Withdrawal  Questionnaire  (AWQ)  score  of  10  or higher.  The  combined  mean  duration  of  amphetamine  use  his­ tories  and  length  of  time  since  last  use  of  amphetamine  prior  to admission  for  the  two  studies  on  amineptine  was  23.6  months and  55.2  hours,  respectively.  The  average  age  of  the  participants was  19.1  years.  Participants  in  the Kongsakon  2005 study  were detainees  from  a  probation  facility  who  were  diagnosed  with  am­ phetamine  dependence  by  DSM-IV  criteria.  All  the  participants in  this  study  were  males  and  had  an  average  age  of  24.3  years. Participants  in  the Cruickshank  2008 study  were  those  that  met DSM-IV  criteria  for  amphetamine  dependence,  reported  using amphetamine  or  methamphetamine  within  the  last  72  hours,  and were recruited from two drug and alcohol out-patient clinics.

**Treatment regimes** Two  studies (Srisurapanont  1999b;  Jittiwutikan  1997) adminis­ tered  300  mg  of  amineptine  per  day,  given  orally  in  two  100  mg 

4

capsules  after  breakfast  and  one  100  mg  capsule  after  lunch.  In these  two  studies,  low  dose  of  lorazepam  was  administered  on occasion  to  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  anxiety  or  insom­ nia.  One  study (Kongsakon  2005) administered  a  dose  range of  15-60  mg  per  day  of  mirtazapine  with  an  initial  dose  of  15 mg.  Dose  titrations  during  this  study  were  based  on  the  subjects’ clinical  response  to  the  medication.  No  medication  other  than mirtazapine  was  used  according  to  the  study  report.  In  another study (Cruickshank  2008), participants  were  administered  15  mg of  mirtazapine  on  the  first  two  nights  and  30  mg  mirtazapine  every night  for  the  next  12  nights.  In  all  four  studies (Srisurapanont 

1999b;  Jittiwutikan  1997,  Kongsakon  2005;  Cruickshank  2008), the treatment duration was 14 days.

**Excluded studies** Five  studies  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  inclusion  in  this  review 

#### (Gillin  1994;  McGregor  2008a;  McGregor  2005;  Chan-Ob  2001; Cox  2004). The  reasons  for  exclusions  are  described  in  “Charac­ teristics of excluded studies.”

# **Allocation** One  study  was  judged  to  be  at  low  risk  of  bias  and  three  studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias.

#### **Blinding** For  objective  outcomes  (discontinuation  rates),  blindness  of  par­ ticipants, personnel,  and outcome  assessors differed  across studies. Because  we  judged  that  the  objective  outcome  was  unlikely  to  be influenced  by  the  lack  of  blinding,  all  studies  were  determined  to be at low risk of bias. For  subjective  outcomes  (global  state,  craving,  and  withdrawal symptoms),  blindness  of  participants,  personnel,  and  outcome  as­ sessors  were  conducted  in  only  one  study  and  was  determined  to be  at  low  risk  of  bias.  In  two  studies,  it  was  unclear  if  the  outcome 

to be at unclear risk of bias.

**Effects of interventions** Four  studies  met  the  criteria  to  be  included  in  this  review (Srisurapanont 1999b; Jittiwutikan 1997; Kongsakon 2005;

## Cruickshank  2008). The  results  were  summarized,  with  compar­ ison  of  quantitative  data  where  possible,  between  any  pharmaco­ logical  treatments  (amineptine,  mirtazapine)  and  placebo  at  the end  of  the  14-day  medication  period.  Outcomes  were  reported based on available data. (1)  Discontinuation rate In  all  four  studies  involving  125  participants,  the  discontinuation 

rate  was  defined  as  the  number  of  participants  who  did  not  com­ plete  the  study.  Overall,  a  significant  difference  in  discontinuation rates  was  observed  between  treatment  and  placebo  groups  (RR 0.52,  95%  CI  0.29  to  0.94) (Analysis  1.1). The  results  indicated that  participants  receiving  any  active  treatment,  but  particularly amineptine,  were  significantly  less  likely  to  discontinue  the  study as  compared  to  those  receiving  placebo.  Hetereogeneity  among the  four  studies  was  considered  moderate  but  not  statistically  sig­ nificant  (I2=45%,  p=0.14).  The  moderate  level  of  heterogeneity among  the  studies  was  related  to  the  treatment  medication  used 

(amineptine versus mirtazapine). See Figure 4

(2)  Average score in global state The  average  score  in  global  state  was  reported  in  three  of  the  four included  studies.  Two  studies (Srisurapanont  1999b;  Jittiwutikan 1997) used  the  Clinical  Global  Impression  or  CGI (Guy  1976) and  one (Cruickshank  2008) used  the  Brief  Symptom  Inventory Global  Severity  Index  sub  scale  or  BSI-GSI (Derogatis  1993) to measure  global  state.  For  both  CGI  and  BSI-GSI,  a  higher  score indicates greater severity. The  data  from  the  three  studies,  involving  103  participants,  were significantly  heterogenous  (I2=69%,  p=0.04).  The  heterogeneity was  most  likely  related  to  the  difference  in  treatment  medication (amineptine  versus  mirtazapine)  and  measurements  used  (CGI

versus  BSI-GSI)  among  the  studies,  therefore  a  combined  result was not calculated. However,  in  a  subgroup  analysis  between  amineptine  and  placebo, the  Weighted  Mean  Difference  (WMD)  was  -0.49  (95%  CI  0.80  to  -0.17),  showing  that  participants  receiving  amineptine  was significantly  more  likely  to  improve  in  global  state  than  placebo 

(Analysis  1.2). No  difference  was  found  between  mirtazapine  and placebo  (WMD  0.30,  95%  CI  -0.22  to  0.82)  based  on  the  data  of one  study (Cruickshank  2008).  Kongsakon  2005 did  not  report data  on  global  state,  hence  it  was  not  included  in  the  analysis.  See Figure 5

(3) Average score in withdrawal symptoms Although  three  studies  reported  data  on  withdrawal  symptoms, only  two  studies  involving  74  participants  were  included  in  the analysis (Srisurapanont  1999b;  Cruickshank  2008). Data  from Kongsakon  2005 for  this  specific  outcome  were  not  used  because only median  withdrawal scores  were reported  and means  and stan­ dard  deviations  were  needed  for  the  comparison.  However,  the study  did  report  significant  improvements  in  amphetamine  with­ drawal  symptoms  as  measured  by  the  Amphetamine  Withdrawal Questionnaire  (AWQ)  in  the  mirtazapine  group  versus  placebo. Srisurapanont  1999b used  the  AWQ,  which  is  a  10-item,  self-ad­ ministered instrument based on the DSM-IV withdrawal criteria

(4) Average score in craving One  study (Jittiwutikan  1997), involving  29  participants,  re­ ported  data  on  craving  using  the  Questionnaire  for  Evaluating  Co­ caine  Craving  and  Related  Responses  or  QECCRR (Voris  1991). The  QECCRR  was  developed  to  separately  measure  four  respects of  cocaine  withdrawal,  including  craving,  depressed  mood,  no  en­ ergy  and  sick  feeling.  Only  the  craving  score  of  QECCRR  was used  in  the  analysis.  For  this  measure,  a  high  score  indicates  less severity  in  craving.  The  WMD  was  0.43  (95%  CI  -1.23  to  2.09) and was not statistically significant (Analysis 1.4). See Figure 7

In  summary,  the  results  showed  some  benefits  of  amineptine  in  the treatment  of  amphetamine  withdrawal,  as  seen  in  the  discontin­ uation  rate  and  improvements  in  the  global  state  as  measured  by CGI.  There  were  no  direct  benefits  of  amineptine  on  withdrawal symptoms  or  craving.  Mirtazapine  was  no  more  effective  than placebo  in  terms  of  discontinuation  rate,  improvements  on  global state,  and  reduction  in  withdrawal  symptoms  based  on  the  results of one study (Cruickshank 2008).

## ments  for  amphetamine  withdrawal.  To  date,  only  amineptine  and mirtazapine  have  been  studied  for  treating  this  condition  using placebo-controls,  blinding  and  randomisation.  Amineptine  is  a central  stimulant  and  dopamine  reuptake  inhibitor  with  biochem­ ical  and  pharmacological  effects  similar  to  those  of  amphetamine 

(Samanin  1977). Amineptine  was  initially  used  as  an  antidepres­ sant  in  France;  availability  of  amineptine  was  limited  in  other countries.  Amineptine  was  voluntarily  withdrawn  from  the  mar­ ket  in  1999  due  to  reports  of  amineptine  abuse.  Mirtazapine  is an  antidepressant  with  a  relatively  good  tolerance  and  safety  pro­ file. It has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Adminis-

that  clinical  trials  of  potential  medications  for  the  treatment  of amphetamine  withdrawal  are  needed.  Additional  clinical  studies assessing  the  natural  history  of  amphetamine  withdrawal,  the  role these symptoms  play in  relapse to  amphetamine use,  as well  as the validity  and  reliability  of  clinical  measures  to  assess  amphetamine withdrawal,  are  also  needed.  Medications  that  should  be  consid­ ered  for  evaluation  in  future  clinical  trials  include  those  that  in­ crease  dopamine,  norepinephrine  and/or  serotonin  activities  of  the brain.  Naturalistic  studies  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  symptoms and  course  are  also  crucial  for  the  development  of  study  designs appropriate  for  further  treatment  studies  of  amphetamine  with­ drawal.

nence.  Chronic  amphetamine  abusers  seeking  treatment  must  suc­ cessfully  resolve  amphetamine  withdrawal  when  establishing  sus­ tained  abstinence  from  the  drug.  It  remains  unknown  whether improved  outcomes  in  successfully  resolving  amphetamine  with­ drawal  would  also  correspond  with  longer  term  abstinence  out­ comes. There  is  good  reason  to  consider  medications  for  amphetamine withdrawal  that  demonstrate  the  propensities  to  increase  central dopamine,  norepinephrine  and/or  serotonin  activities.  Naturalis­ tic  studies  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  symptoms  and  course  are also  crucial  for  the  development  of  study  designs  appropriate  for further treatment studies of amphetamine withdrawal.

**AUTHORS’ CONCLUSIONS** **Implications for practice** The  evidence  about  the  treatment  for  amphetamine  withdrawal is  very  limited.  Although  amineptine  has  limited  benefits  for  am­ phetamine  withdrawal,  this  drug  has  been  withdrawn  from  the market.  Mirtazapine  has  not  been  shown  to  be  effective  for  am­

## phetamine  withdrawal,  although  the  number  of  studies  is  limited. At  present,  there  is  no  evidence  to  guide  selection  of  medications that  might  relieve  symptoms  of  amphetamine  withdrawal  for  pa­ tients in initial abstinence from chronic amphetamine use.

**Implications for research** While  there  are  few  medications  that  have  been  evaluated,  am­ phetamine  withdrawal  seems  a  reasonable  target  for  developing a medication to aid individuals in instilling amphetamine absti-
