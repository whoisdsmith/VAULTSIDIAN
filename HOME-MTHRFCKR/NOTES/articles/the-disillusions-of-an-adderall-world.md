In the 1990s, three to five percent of American children were believed to have what was referred to as “disordered attention.” By 2013, 11 percent were believed to have disordered attention. In 1990, six hundred thousand children were on Ritalin, and by 2013 three and a half million children were on [[stimulants]]. So was this better diagnosing of the problem? Is the diagnosis actually reliable? And is there an ironic result of treating the problem pharmacologically?

All these questions are explored in Casey Schwartz’s book, [_Attention: A Love Story_](https://bookshop.org/books/attention-a-love-story/9781524747107), but the telling is enhanced by your own personal romance with [[home-mthrfckr/notes/articles/adderall]]. This week on _Just the Right Book_, Roxanne Coady and Casey explore her explanation of what brilliant writers like David Foster Wallace have to say about attention and just why attention might be the key to a full life.

_From the episode:_

**Roxanne Coady:** You say that your [[home-mthrfckr/notes/articles/adderall]] hours were your precious hours.

**Casey Schwartz:** It felt like that because [[home-mthrfckr/notes/articles/adderall]] was like this mythical silver bullet where it felt like it sort of solved the problem, whatever the problem was. I just loved sitting in the darkest recesses of the library at my college and just losing myself in complicated texts that I now could focus on for hours effortlessly. It was like there was such an ecstasy around it.

**Roxanne Coady:** And what did you start noticing about your non-[[home-mthrfckr/notes/articles/adderall]] world?

**Casey Schwartz:** It’s funny. I think a lot of people who take [[home-mthrfckr/notes/articles/adderall]] have shared this experiences that you’ve got a very short fuse. You know, you’re not sleeping well. You’re not sleeping as much as you do. You’re taking [[amphetamines]]. You get irritable. You’re humorless. I would isolate myself. I would hold up in my room all through college, wherever I lived. Just sort of resent my noisy roommates on the other side of the door and just hole up and it felt like the only thing that was a real value was whatever work I was engaged in. As if normal social life didn’t count as much. That was the delusion of this drug.
