GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

ABOUT THIS BOOK **This  book  is  written  for  people  who  are  thinking  about** 

## **or  trying  to  stop  using  amphetamines,  even  if  just  for  a** 

**short period of time.**

Information  in  this  book  will  help  you  understand  what's going  on  during  withdrawal.  There  are  also  suggestions  for 

how  you  can  make  it  easier  for  yourself  and  those  around you.  It  is  only  a  guide.  For  more  help,  we  suggest  that  you talk to your doctor, counsellor or other health worker. This  book  doesn't  cover  everything  about  coming  off amphetamines  -  you  may  have  had  experiences  that  are  dif­ ferent  to  those  included  here.  We  hope  that  there  are  things that  you  find  helpful,  even  if  you  have  gone  through  with­ drawal before. You  can  use  this  book  as  one  of  a  range  of  strategies  to  help you  make  the  decision  to  stop  using  and  support  you through  withdrawal.  Other  options  that  may  be  useful 

include  counselling,  medication,  natural  therapies  and 

involvement in support groups.

### MAKING THE DECISION

### TO STOP USING AMPHETAMINES

## Like  a  lot  of  things,  using  amphetamines  has  some  good sides  to  it  but  it  can  also  have  its  problems.  These  are  going to  be  different  for  different  people.  It  is  worthwhile  thinking about what's involved in going without amphetamines. What  things  will  you  miss  about  using?  How  is  using  affect­

ing  you  and  how  could  your  life  be  better if you  were  not 

using?

2

MAKING THE DECISION TO STOP USING AMPHEATMINES

You  may  find  it  helpful  to  make  a list of  the  positives  and  the 

negatives  about  using  amphetamines.  Put  simply,  the  posi­

tives  are  the  things  you  like  about  using  amphetamines:  the 

negatives  are  the  reasons  why  you  want  to  stop.  You  may 

also  find  it  helpful  to  talk  to  someone  to  help  you  decide. 

This  might  be  a  non-using  friend,  your  health  worker  or  a 

professional  counsellor.  Confidential  24-hour  drug  and  alco­

hol  telephone  counselling  and  information  services  are  avail­

able  in  all  Australian  states,  and  they  are  a  good  way  of  get­

ting further help. Contact numbers are listed on page 36.

Many  people  find  that  stopping  amphetamines  can  be  diffi­

cult  because,  even  after  making  the  decision  to  stop,  they 

still  miss  some  things  about  using.  This  is  normal  and  it 

often  takes  time  to  find  things  other  than  amphetamines 

that fill this gap.

Another  reason  many  people  find  it  difficult  is  that  they  for­

get  the  'negatives'  -  the  reasons  why  they  wanted  to  stop 

in  the  first  place.  So  the  list  of  negatives  you  make is impor­

tant  because  it  helps  focus  you  on  all  the  reasons  for  stop­

ping (see page 4).

People  decide  to  come  off  amphetamines  for  different  rea­

sons  and  they  often  have  different  long-term  goals.  Some 

people  want  to  stop  using  forever:  others  just  need  a  break 

from  it.  Whatever  your  reasons  are  for  starting  withdrawal 

or  what  your  long-term  goals  are,  the  main  job  ahead  of  you 

now is to get through withdrawal.

AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL What is withdrawal?

## If  you  use  certain  kinds  of  drugs  -  such  as  tobacco,  alcohol, amphetamines,  tranquillisers  ('downers',  eg  Valium, Serepax),  caffeine  or  heroin  -  regularly  and  for  long  periods of  time,  your  body  goes  through  a  number  of  changes.  It adapts  to  having  the  drug  in  your  system  on  a  regular  basis and  your  body  only  functions  'normally'  when  you  have taken  that  drug.  When  you  stop  using,  your  body  has  to readjust.  Withdrawal  is  this  period  of  readjustment.  Your 

body  has  to  get  back  to  a  state  of  working  'normally'  with­ out  the  drug.  The  type  of  symptoms  that  people  go  through during  withdrawal  varies  according  to  the  kind  of  drug  they are withdrawing from, but the principle is the same.

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

How long will the symptoms last?

## People  vary  in  the **severity** of  withdrawal  symptoms  they will  experience  and  how  long  the  symptoms  will  last,  even 

people  who  have  been  using  the  same  amount.  Some  peo­

ple  do  it  easier  than  others.  The  more  you  know  about what's  happening,  what  to  expect  and  what  to  do,  the  bet­ ter  you  will  cope  with  withdrawal.  If  you  really  fear  going through  withdrawal,  don't  know  what's  going  on  and  expect to ‘do it hard' - then you probably will.

Other  important  factors  include  your  general  state  of  health and  nutrition,  the  length  of  time  you've  been  using  the  drug, 

how  much  you're  using  on  a  regular  basis,  and  what's  going on  in  the  environment  around  you  during  withdrawal. 

People  who  regularly  use  prescription  drugs  such  as amphetamine-based  weight  reduction  drugs  (eg  Tenuate, 

Duromine)  or  other  drugs  like  Ritalin  or  Dexamphetamine will  also  experience  withdrawal  symptoms  similar  to amphetamine withdrawal when these drugs are stopped. What kinds of symptoms will I have? Withdrawal  from  amphetamines  is  described  in  detail  on 

page  7.  The  list  is  a  helpful  guide  to  what  you  might  expect at each stage of withdrawal.

Not  all  amphetamine  users  get  all  these  symptoms  and some get symptoms not listed.

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

**At  the  beginning  of  your  withdrawal,  it  is  important  to** 

**get a few things in order.**

Organise a safe environment

## Going  through  withdrawal  can  be  extremely  difficult  if  there are  people  around  you  who  are  using.  Although  it is possi­

ble  to  do  it,  you're  just  making it hard  for  yourself. **Organise** **a  safe  environment  before  or  at  the  beginning  of  your** **withdrawal.** A  safe  place  is  one  where  there  won't  be  any drugs  around  you  and  where  you  are  not  going  to  be  has­ sled by people. This means either:

•  Go  to  a  friend  or  relative's  house  where  you  are  not 

going  to  have  ready  access  to  amphetamines  and  where 

you  can't  be  found  by  people  who  you  don't  want 

around. **or**

•  Stay  at  your  usual  address,  then  put  the  word  out  that 

you  are  not  going  to  be  using  for  a  while  and  for  people 

to  stay  away.  You  might  even  want  to  change  your 

phone  number.  This  doesn't  mean  that  you  have  to  cut 

yourself  off  from  them  forever,  just  while  you  are  trying 

to get through withdrawal.

Make sure that there are no drugs left around the house.

Organise support You  can  try  go  through  withdrawal  on 

## your  own,  without  talking  to  anyone  and without  getting  support  and  advice  from anyone.  However,  you  will  probably  find 

it easier to  get  some  support.  Your  doc­ tor or  health  worker  may be  able  to  help you  cope  with  everything  that's  going

want to talk to.

on.  People  from  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  and  other  sup­

port groups can also be helpful.

**It  is  important  to  have  the  right  people  around  you** 

**while  you  go  through  withdrawal.  This  means  people** 

**who  will  be  supportive,  spend  time  with  you  and  help** 

**you  get  through  the  difficult  moments.** Before  you  start, 

make  a  list  of  these  people  (see  page  12).  Avoid  anyone 

who  is  going  to  make  it  hard  for  you,  such  as  dealers  or  sup­

pliers  of  drugs,  people  who  may  want  you  to  score  for 

them,  or  anyone  who  you  feel  that  you  just  couldn't  stand 

having  around.  A  good  doctor,  community  nurse  or  other 

counsellor  can  be  a  great  support.  Self-help  groups  such  as 

Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  can  provide  a  lot  of  support,  and 

also provide you with a 'sponsor' or support person.

Once  you've  made  this  list  (it  may  only  have  one  name  on 

it),  explain  to  these  people  what's  going  on,  how  you're 

going  to  be  feeling,  and  what  they  can  do  to  support  you.  If 

they  aren't  aware  of  what's  happening,  it's  difficult  for  them 

to  help.  They  may  find  it  useful  to  read  this  book  so  they 

have a better idea about what is going on.

Keep  in  touch  with  these 

supporters,  as  they  will 

help  you  get  over  feel­

ings  of  isolation,  loneli­

ness  and  boredom.  Have 

someone  screen  your 

phone  calls  and  answer 

the  door  so  that  you 

don't  have  contact  with 

people  who  you  don't

Structure the day

GETTING STARTED

## Getting  through  withdrawal  can  be  easier  if  you  take  it  one day  at  a  time  and  focus  on  activities  that  help  you  cope  with the  effects  of  withdrawal.  For  the  first  few  days  you  may feel  like  doing  nothing  but,  as  you  go  through  withdrawal, you  will  begin  to  feel  more  active.  It  may  help  to  think  about 

how  you  will  structure  your  days  before  you  start.  Having  a 

routine  can  help  you  sleep  and  eat  better  and  may  help  you to  manage  mood  swings  and  cravings.  Make  a  list  of  sug­ gestions  for  structuring  your  day  and  fill  it  with  activities  that 

help  you  relax  and  avoid  using.  These  may  include  doing exercise  or  visiting  non-using  friends  (see **Getting  through** **withdrawal).** The role of medication

Medication  can  help  reduce  the  severity  of  some  withdraw­ al  symptoms,  but  the  medication  may  not  stop  the  symp­ toms  completely.  If  a  tablet  existed  that  could  take  away  all the  symptoms  then  your  doctor  would  give  it  to  you,  but  no 

such magic pill exists. There  is  no  single  medication  that  is  particularly  effective  for amphetamine withdrawal. Some medications can help with some  of  the  symptoms  but,  on their  own,  are  not  enough.  It's 

usually  best  to  take  a  few  things that  target  different  symptoms. Your doctor can advise you.

Some  natural  therapies  may  be 

helpful  in  assisting  you  to  man­ age  symptoms  of  withdrawal. 

See  a  qualified  herbalist,  natural therapist or other health profes-

sional  for  advice.  Don't  self-medicate  as  natural  therapies can have side-effects like any other medication.

Some  people  turn  to  using  large  amounts  of  alcohol  or  tran­

quillisers  ('downers')  to  help  them  get  through  withdrawal. A  real  danger  with  this  is  the  risk  of  just  swapping  your 

habit.  So,  think  about  it;  you  may  get  to  stop  using  amphet­ amines,  but  end  up  with  a  pill  or  grog  problem.  Back  to 

square  one.  Remember,  withdrawal  symptoms  are  your 

body's  way  of  getting  back  to  normal  without  having  to  have a  drug  in  your  system.  Flooding  it  with  large  doses  of  other drugs won't help your body get back to normal. A  number  of  medications  that  many  people  find  useful  are 

listed  in  the  following  sections,  together  with  other  ways  of dealing with the symptoms.

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

Cravings 'Cravings'  are  urges  to  use  drugs.  These  urges  are  a  normal 

## part  of  any  addiction  and  everyone  gets  them  during  with­ drawal. Some important points about cravings: •  Cravings  are  a  common  symptom  of  amphetamine  with­ drawal. •  Cravings  are  not  caused  by  a  lack  of  willpower  or  moti­ vation,  and  they  don't  mean  that  the  withdrawal  isn't working. •  Urges  to  use  are  not  constant.  They  come  and  go,  and vary  in  intensity  with  time.  Cravings  are  only  very  severe for  short  periods  of  time,  usually  less  than  one  hour,  and then settle down to a more controllable level. •  Cravings  are  often  triggered  by  physical  or  psychological discomfort.  You  will  have  cravings  as  you  go  through uncomfortable  withdrawal  symptoms.  The  cravings 

become  fewer  and  easier  to  cope  with  as  you  get  over the withdrawal symptoms. •  You  will  get  more  cravings  if  something  or  someone upsets  you  or,  obviously,  if  you're  presented  with  the opportunity  to  use  or  score.  So,  if  you  want  to  get through  this  withdrawal,  you  have  to  make  sure  that  you avoid these high-risk situations (see page 27). •  You  will  probably  still  get  cravings,  even  after  you've gone  through  withdrawal,  but  they  usually  become  easi­ er  to  cope  with  after  withdrawal  because  they  are  not accompanied  by  physical  symptoms.  The  longer  you  go without  using,  the  less  severe  the  cravings  become.  It's 

like  a  hungry  cat  -  if  you  feed  it,  it  will  come  back  again and again. If you don't, it will (eventually) go away.

**How to cope with cravings**

It  is  important  that  you  are  prepared  for  cravings  -  you  will 

get  them.  Different  people  have  different  ways  of  coping. 

Remember,  cravings  are  usually  only  very  severe  for  short 

periods  of  time,  then  the  severity  of  the  craving  reduces  to 

a  level  which  is  easier  to  deal  with.  The  goal  is  to  get 

through  this  severe  period.  The  following  methods  have 

been successful for many people.

**Delay the decision about using for one hour**

When a  craving  is  severe, the  big  question is: 'Am  I going to 

use?'  It's normal when you  get  cravings  to go through  the 

struggle between  the desire  to use and the desire  to  remain 

drug  free.  The more you  try  to  battle  this out,  the  more anx­

ious  you become  and  the  more severe  your craving 

becomes.  So  delay this  decision:  put it off for an hour. Don't 

try to decide one way or the other.

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

You  may  use,  you  may  not  -  that's  something  that  you  can decide after an hour. **Distract yourself with some activity during this hour** Cravings  can occupy  your  thoughts a lot. The  more you think about  them,  the bigger  they  become.  One  way to avoid  this  is  by  putting  your  energy into  other things  such  as listening to music  or  a  relaxation tape, watching TV or  a video, cleaning out  the fridge, talking to someone  (but not about  drugs)  or  going  for  a  walk  with  someone  'safe'. Remember,  concentration can  be difficult  during  withdraw­ al, so  don't plan to do anything  too  complicated  (such  as reading anything too heavy) or you will just get frustrated. **After the  hour, ask  yourself 'Why** **don't  I  want  to  use?'  and  ‘What** **have I got to lose?'** By this stage  the  craving  should have  settled  down  -  although probably  not gone away.  Go over all the reasons  why  you  want  to stop  using,  why  you  are trying to withdraw  and,  importantly,  what you will  be  returning  to  if  you  get back  into using full  on  again. Look  at  the  pros  (positives)  and cons (negatives)  about  using  that you wrote  down  at the beginning of the withdrawal.

Sleep

GETTING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL

## Unfortunately,  disturbed  sleep  is  part  of  what  you  can expect  when  withdrawing  from  amphetamines.  You  may  be familiar  with  being  awake  for  long  periods,  even  several days,  and  then  the  'comedown'  -  sleeping  heavily  for  days. This  occurs  because  of  the  changes  that  are  happening  to your  nervous  system  and  brain  as  your  body  gets  used  to working  normally  without  amphetamines.  After  the  initial comedown,  you  may  experience  difficulty  falling  asleep,  dis­ turbing  dreams,  nightmares  or  night  sweats,  waking  up  in the  middle  of  the  night,  or  waking  up  early  in  the  mornings. 

It  can  take  a  number  of  weeks  before  your sleep pattern 

returns  to **normal** (more  if  you  have  been  using  for  many years  or  if  you  have  been  using  tranquillisers  recently).  It  is 

important  to  remember  that  disturbed  sleep  is  a **normal** 

part of withdrawal, and that it is not permanent. There will be  nights when you  don't  get much sleep, 

but eventually you  will  get a  good  night's sleep  when  your  body needs it.  It 

is unrealistic to  expect  to get  8  hours sleep  every 

night  and,  to  a  certain degree,  you have  to accept that it  will take time to 

return  to  a  normal sleep 

pattern. It is like resetting your  body  clock.  There  are a  number of things  that you can do to help this hap­

pen more  quickly  (see 

**Hints for better sleep).**

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

**Hints for better sleep** 1.  Lie  down  to  go  to  sleep  only  when  you  are  actually sleepy.  For  some  people,  this  means  going  to  bed  a  lot later than usual. 2.  Do  not  use  your  bed  for  anything  except  sleeping.  Do  not read,  watch  TV,  eat  or  worry  in  bed.  Sex  is the only exception  to  this  rule  (remember  to  do it safely). If you have  found  that  reading  helps  you  fall  asleep,  feel  free  to break  this  rule  and  read  in  bed  but  do  it  for  no  longer  than 20 minutes. 3.  If  you  do  not  fall  asleep  within  about  30  minutes  of  turn­ ing  out  the  light,  get  up,  go  to  another  room,  and  do something  that  is  not  too  arousing  (for  example,  read  a magazine  or  watch  TV).  Stay  up  as  long  as  you  wish,  and then  return  to  your  bedroom  when  you  feel  sleepy.  The goal  is  to  associate  your  bed  with  falling  asleep  quickly. 

If  you  return  to  bed  and  still  cannot  sleep,  then  get  up again. Do this  as  often  as  necessary  until  you  fall  asleep within 30 minutes of going to bed. 4.  Get  up  at  the  same  time  every  morning,  7  days  a  week, regardless  of  how  long  you  have  slept.  This  will  help  your body to develop a regular sleep rhythm. 5.  Do  not  nap  during the day.  Even  a  5  minute  nap in front of  the  television  can  take  the  edge  off  your  sleepiness, and make it harder for you to sleep at night. 6.  Do  some  form  of  relaxation.  While  doing  relaxation  dur­ ing the day,  make  sure  that  you  do  not  fall  asleep. However,  at  bedtime,  feel  free  to  fall  asleep  in  bed  dur­ ing  the  relaxation.  Relaxation  methods  can  be  particular­ ly  useful  for  people  who  wake  during the night  and  then have  trouble  falling  asleep  again, or for  people  who  are light  sleepers.  Relaxation  methods  are  described  on  the following pages.

GETTING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL

7.  Do  some  exercise  during  the  day.  This  will  make  your 

body  more  physically  tired.  Exercise  may  include  walk­

ing,  having  a  swim,  yoga,  gym  or  any  other  activity  you 

enjoy. Avoid stimulating activity before going to bed.

8.  Most  of  the  thinking  and  worrying  that  we  do  in  bed 

needs  to  be  done,  it  just  does  not  need  to  be  done  in 

bed.  Take  the  time  earlier  in  the  day  for  thinking  and  wor­

rying.  Write  your  thoughts  down  on  a  piece  of  paper  to 

pick  up  tomorrow.  Then,  if  the  thoughts  come  when  you 

are  in  bed,  say  to  yourself  'I  have  thought  about  this 

today.  I  will  think  about  it  tomorrow.  Now  is  the  time  to 

sleep.'  This  will  not  work  every  time,  but  if  it  works  only 

half the time, that's better than not at all.

9.  Cut  down  on  stimulants  such  as  caffeine  or  cigarettes, 

especially  late  at  night.  Alcohol  can  make  you  sleepy; 

however,  it  also  has  a  waking  effect  after  several  hours 

sleep,  so  that  it  often  results  in  a  poor  night's  sleep  over­

all.  Hot  drinks  such  as  camomile,  valerian  tea  or  warm 

milk at night can help put you to sleep.

**Medication for sleep**

Certain  medications  are  used  by  some  people  to  treat 

insomnia  and  agitation.  However,  medication  is  of  limited 

value  in  trying  to  help  you  return  to  a  normal  pattern  of 

sleep.  All  sedative  drugs  work  by  producing  abnormal  sleep. 

They  may  'bomb  you  out'  for  a  while  but  they  don’t  encour­

age  your  body  to  get  back  into  a  normal  sleep  pattern. 

Sedative  drugs  reduce  what  is  called  'delta  wave'  sleep  and 

this  is  the  part  of  sleep  that  is  most  important  in  'charging 

your  batteries'.  So  these  drugs  lengthen  the  time  it  takes  for 

the return of your normal sleep pattern.

If  these  pills  are  taken  for  more  than  a  week  or  so,  then  your 

body  gets  used  to  them  and  you  will  experience  more  prob­

lems  with  sleep  when  you  try  to  stop  them.  If  you  are  going to  use  such  medication,  don't  take  them  for  more  than  a week,  and  only  take  them  as  directed  by  your  doctor. The sedatives that are routinely used are of two types:

**•  Benzodiazepines**

There  are  a  large  variety  of  these  drugs  (eg  Serepax, 

Mogadon,  Valium,  Normison,  Rivotril,  Ducene,  Murelax, 

Euhypnos).

**•  Antidepressants**

Antidepressants  (eg  Deptran,  Endep)  may  be  prescribed 

in  low  doses.  These  drugs  can  be  useful  as  sedatives 

to  promote  sleep,  and  have  an  effect  in  lowering  anxi­

ety  and  feelings  of  agitation.  Some  people  get  side 

effects  such  as  blurred  vision,  dry  mouth  and  dizziness. 

If  you  experience  any  problems,  see  your  doctor. 

Antidepressants  can  be  dangerous in high  doses,  so 

only take them as directed by your doctor.

Relaxing

## **It  is  very  common  to  get  agitated  and  irritable  during** **withdrawal,** so  it  is  important  to  do  things  that  will  help  you 

relax.  There  are  lots  of  ways  to  do  this,  and  different  people find  different  things  more  effective.  Everyone  has  simple ways  to  relax  such  as  watching  television  or  videos,  listen­

ing  to  music,  warm  baths,  doing  simple  exercise  (such  as going  for  a  walk  with  a  friend),  light  reading. 

**Do whatever works for you.** **There  are  other  more  sophisticated  relax­**

**ation methods  that you  can try.** Some peo­

ple  get  a  lot  out  of  things  such  as  medita­ tion,  yoga  and  tai  chi. If you  are  familiar  with these  methods,  use  them.  If  you  are  not familiar  with  them,  it  will  be  difficult  to  learn them during withdrawal.

ation session.

GETTING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL

There  are  a  number  of  simple  relaxation  methods  that 

you  can  use.  One  very  effective  method  is  the  use  of  relax­

ation  tapes;  these  are  pre-recorded  cassettes  that  you  can 

listen  to  whenever  you  feel  tense  or  worried.  Use  head­

phones if possible.  These  tapes  are  available  at  pharmacies, 

community  health  centres,  general  practitioners  or  commu­

Another  very  effective  way  to  relax  is  to  practice  the  fol­

lowing  steps.  Read  the  instructions  and  familiarise  yourself 

with  them  before  having  a  go.  Be  patient  and  give  yourself 

several  tries  before  expecting  to  experience the full  bene­

fits.  It  can  take  time  to  learn  how  to  relax.  The  more  you 

practice,  the  better  you  get  at  it.  Although  these  instructions 

may  be  adequate,  many  people  find  it  helpful  at  first  to  get 

further  training,  either  individually  or  in  classes.  Talk  to  your 

doctor or health worker about it.

**Relaxation techniques**

Sit in a  comfortable  chair  or  lie  down  somewhere  comfort­

able in a  quiet,  warm  room  where  you  will  not be interrupt­

ed.  Wear  comfortable  clothing  and  take  your  shoes  off. 

Close  your  eyes.  Notice  how  you  are  breathing  and  where 

the muscle tensions are.

Start  to  breathe  slowly  and  deeply. Fill your  lungs  right  to 

the  top.  Hold  your  breath  for  a  couple  of  seconds  and  then 

breathe  out  slowly,  and  empty  your  lungs  completely. 

Focus  your  concentration  on  your  breathing  and  keep  a 

slow,  deep,  rhythmic  pattern going throughout  your  relax­

After  5-10  minutes,  when  you  have  your  breathing  pattern 

established,  start the following  sequence,  tensing  each  part 

of  the  body  on  an  in-breath,  holding  your  breath  for  10  sec­

onds  while  you  keep  your  muscles  tense,  then  relaxing  and breathing out at the same time. After  you  have  completed  the  whole  sequence  and  you  are still  breathing  slowly  and  deeply,  imagine  yourself  in  a  calm and  peaceful  place  (eg  at  the  beach,  by  a  lake  or  in  some other  favourite  place).  Try  to  'see'  yourself  there  as  clearly as  possible  (the  sound  of  birds,  the  colour  of  the  water,  the sun  on  your  skin  etc),  concentrating  your  attention  on  it. Continue  to  breath  deeply  and  rhythmically.  After  this,  go  on to  visualise  yourself  in  another  peaceful  place  of  your  choice in  a  similar  way.  Finally,  give  yourself  the  instruction  that, when  you  open  your  eyes,  you  will  be  perfectly  relaxed  but alert.

Relaxation sequence 1.  Curl your toes hard and press your feet down -

## then relax. 2.  Press your heels down and bend your feet up -

then relax. 3.  Tense your calf muscles - then relax. 4.  Tense your thigh muscles, straighten your knees 

and make your legs stiff - then relax. 5.  Make your buttocks tight - then relax. 6.  Tense your stomach as if to receive a punch -

then relax. 7.  Bend your elbows and tense the muscles of your 

arms - then relax. 8.  Hunch your shoulders and press your head back 

into the cushion or pillow - then relax. 9.  Clench your jaws, frown and screw up your eyes 

really tight - then relax. 10.  Tense all your muscles together - then relax.

GETTING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL

**The six-second breath** The  six-second  breath  can  be  used  anywhere  and  any  time when  you  feel  anxious.  Controlling  your  rate  of  breathing  is one  of  the  most  important  things  you  can  do  to  stop  your anxiety  from  getting  out  of  control.  If  you  keep  your  breath­

ing  to  one  breath  every  6  seconds,  this  will  help.  You  can 

breathe  in  over  3  seconds  and  out  over  the  next  3  seconds. This  can  be  done  in  stages  eg  in-in-in,  out-out-out  and  so forth.

**Medication for relaxation** Some  kinds  of  medication  can  take  the  edge  off  agitation during  withdrawal.  Your  doctor  will  advise  you  on  what's 

best  for  you.  However,  as  with  everything  else,  don't expect  the  medication  to  work  on  its  own.  These  medica­ tions  should  only  be  taken  as  directed  by  your  doctor,  and don't  stay  on  them  for  more  than  a  week  or  your  body  will get  used  to  them  and  you  may  have  problems  when  you  try to stop the medication.

Mood swings

## It  is  very  common  during  amphetamine  withdrawal  to  expe­ rience mood changes. At  times  you  will  feel  exhausted,  have  low  levels  of  energy, 

be  unmotivated  to  do  anything  or  just  constantly  tired.  At other  times  you  will  feel  restless,  irritable,  anxious,  agitated and  angry.  All  of  these  symptoms  are  a  normal  part  of  going through amphetamine withdrawal. One  of  the  most  important  things  in  coping  with  these symptoms  is  to  remember  that  they  are  part  of  ampheta­

mine  withdrawal  and  they  will  go  away  eventually.  Other things  you  can  do  to  cope  with  these  mood  changes  include use  of  relaxation  techniques,  exercise,  try  to  get  regular

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

sleep  and  eat  well.  All  of  these  things  play  a  part  in  your 

mood.  If  you  think  your  feelings  are  getting  out  of  control, see your health worker or counsellor.

Strange thoughts

## Some  people  experience  mild  paranoia  or  a  feeling  that  peo­

ple  are  ‘out  to  get  them'.  Others  may  misinterpret  things they  see  and  hear  around  them  (for  example,  briefly  seeing things  that  aren't  there  out  of  the  corner  of  their  eye  or thinking  that  the  sound  of  a  car  going  by  is  someone  calling their  name).  These  experiences  are  common  during  periods of  amphetamine  use  and  may  continue  (or  even  get  worse) 

during withdrawal.

Having  these  symptoms  does  not  mean  that  you  are  going 

mad,  and  they  generally  settle  down  as  long  as  you  don't 

use  amphetamines.  If  the  symptoms  continue  after  with­

drawal  or  get  worse,  or  if  you  feel  concerned,  you  should discuss them with your doctor, counsellor or health worker.

Eating again

## Most  people  who  use  amphetamines  regularly  have  a  poor appetite  and  often  have  lost  a  lot  of  weight.  It  is  important that  you  start  to  eat  well  again.  Usually  people's  appetites 

improve  within  days  of  their  last  use.  Try  to  eat  healthy foods,  such  as  fresh  fruit  and  vegetables,  and  stay  away from greasy, fried and fatty foods.

It  is  also  a  good  idea  to  drink  lots  of  fluids  -  at  least  2  litres a  day.  Avoid  alcoholic  drinks  (these  will  dehydrate  you)  and drinks  containing  caffeine  (eg  tea,  coffee,  cola).  Try  to  drink only  water  and  fruit  juices.  Cordial  mixed  with  water  and 

non-fizzy  mineral  waters  are  also  very  good.  Try  to  keep  the fluids  going  in  throughout  the  day,  taking  small  sips  all  the time.  Drinking  a  lot  of  fluids  will  help  your  kidneys  flush  out the toxins that have accumulated in your body.

Aches and pains

## It is  common  to  get  headaches  or  general  aches  and  pains 

in  your  body.  These  are  caused  by  increased  muscle  ten­

sion. The worst  of  the pains generally settle down  within 

the first week or two. The following things may help:

**•  Warm baths, spas and saunas**

Use  bath  salts  or  bath  oils  at  home,  and  check  out  your 

local gym or swim centre.

**•  Massages**

Great  if  you  can  organise  a  professional  job,  but  even 

getting  a  friend  to  do it or  doing  it  yourself  can  work  won­

ders (depends on the friend).

**•  Light exercise**

Going  for  a walk, a  swim, a jog,  a  bike  ride  or  even  just 

doing  stretching  exercises  can  help  -  anything  that  you 

feel  up  to.  Don't  overdo  it  and  try  to  avoid  high impact 

sports.

**•  Medication**

Medications such as  aspirin  or  paracetamol  can  also 

help,  but  only  take  them  as  directed  as  excessive  use 

can have hazardous consequences.

High-risk situations

## There  are  some  situations  which  make  you  feel  like  using 

again.  These  high-risk  situations  vary  from  person  to  per­

son,  and  are  often  related  to  the  circumstances in which 

you  were  using  amphetamines  in  the  first  place  -  the  peo­

ple you  used  with or scored  from,  the  places  you  link  with 

using (such as  a  certain  nightclub,  friend's  house  or  part  of 

town)  or  the  time  of  day  (or  night) when you  used  amphet­

amines.

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

Not  being  able  to deal with  these  high-risk  situations  is a common  reason  why  people  'slip up' and  start using again. 

So  think  about  what  the  high-risk  situations  for  you  might  be over the next few days. Make a list. There are a number of ways to try to deal with them.

•  The  first  is to try  to  avoid  the  situation wherever possi­

ble.  Which of your  risk  situations  can  you  avoid,  and  how 

are  you  going  to  do  this?  This  may  mean  staying  away 

from certain people, places or events.

•  Another  way  to  cope  is  to  have  a  plan  ready  in  case  you 

do  find yourself in  a  high-risk  situation.  Think  about  your 

risk  situations.  What  will  you  say  if  you  find  yourself in 

'danger'? What will you do?

•  Remember the coping  strategies  you  used  before  -  how 

to cope with cravings, how to relax.

Counselling There  are  many  different  types of counselling. **Counselling** 

## **during  withdrawal  is  aimed  at  helping  you  get  through** **this  period  and  then  looking  at  what  you  want  to  do** 

**next.** Sometimes this is called 'supportive counselling'. Towards  the end of withdrawal,  you  may want to  look  at counselling  to  help  you  avoid  using  again.  This  is  sometimes called 'drug  counselling',  and  might  include  relapse  preven­ tion or coping skills therapy to help you stay off the drugs.

In  general,  while  you are going  through  withdrawal,  it  is rec­ ommended  that  you  don't  try  to  get  into  heavy  counselling about  stuff  that  happened  to  you  years  ago,  nor  try to 'work out'  your  personal,  relationship or family  problems.  This type of counselling is sometimes called 'psychotherapy'.

used).

GETTING THROUGH WITHDRAWAL

It  is  not  advisable  to  begin  heavy  counselling  during  with­

drawal because:

•  Working  through  such  issues  can  often  be  emotionally 

painful  and  cause  a  lot  of  anxiety.  Opening  a  'can  of 

worms'  during  withdrawal  may  make  you  want  to  go  and 

use, and may put your withdrawal in jeopardy.

•  People  often  aren't  thinking  too  clearly  during  withdraw­

al.  There  isn't  much  point  in  trying  to  work  on  stuff  that's 

bothering  you  while  you  are  feeling  irritable,  agitated, 

tired  and  run  down,  are  having  mood  swings,  poor  sleep 

and difficulty concentrating as part of withdrawal.

**Our  advice  is  to  deal  with  one  thing  at  a  time.** First,  get 

through  the  withdrawal.  When  you  are  feeling  better  physi­

cally  and  mentally  and  you  aren't  hanging  out  as  much,  then 

you can choose to deal with all the other heavy stuff.

It's all too much

## **It's  very  common  for  people  going  through  withdrawal** 

**to  feel  as  though  they're  not  going  to  get  to  the  end  of** 

**their  withdrawal** -  which  may  be  3  days,  10  days  or  3 

weeks  away.  Goals  that  are  too  far  away  in  time  often 

seem impossible to reach.

The  best  way  to  cope  with  this  common  difficulty is to  stop 

thinking  in  terms  of  days  or  weeks,  and  to **concentrate  on** 

**the  immediate  future.** Can  you  make  it  to  tomorrow  morn­

ing  without  using?  If  tomorrow  seems  too  far  away,  can  you 

get  through  the  next  hour  without  using?  After  all,  you  may 

feel  better  then  (and  the  next  day  you  may  regret  having

GETTING THROUGH AMPHETAMINE WITHDRAWAL

**In  other  words,  break  up  the  withdrawal  into  short  peri­** **ods  and  deal  with  each  one  on  its  own:** **'One day at a time'.**

If  you  get  halfway  through  withdrawal  and  you  are  feeling  as though  you  can't  finish,  it  is  important  to  remind  yourself that  you  have  been  coping  with  the  symptoms  for  the  last few  days.  Look  at  what  you  did  then  that  helped  you  cope, and  continue  with  it.  After  all,  it  has  been  working.  Your  doc­ tor,  counsellor  or  health  worker  can  help  you  through  any difficult  periods.  Or  you  can  contact  your  local  24-hour  alco­ hol  and  drug  information,  counselling  and  support  service. People  from  Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  and  other  support groups can also be helpful.

Sex and withdrawal A  lot  of  people  notice  that  their  sex  drive  increases  when 

## coming  off  amphetamines.  Others  find  that  it  decreases. This  isn't  going  to  make  your  withdrawal  easier  or  harder 

(but  maybe  more  interesting,  it  just  depends  where  you're at  and  your  partner).  It's  always  a  good  idea  to  practice  safe sex.  So  remember  to  have  plenty  of  condoms  and  water­

based lubricant (such as K-Y® Brand jelly) handy.

AFTER WITHDRAWAL What next? The  day  will  come  when  you  start  to  feel  much  better  and 

## you  are  through  the  worst  of  withdrawal.  It's  worthwhile  to 

have  something  prepared  that  you  will  enjoy  as  a  reward  for all  you  have  been  through  (other  than  amphetamines  or other drugs).

It's  at  this  point  that  you  should  start  to  think  about  what  to do  next.  It's  worthwhile  talking  to  someone  about  your options.  These  may  include  counselling,  going  to  a  long­ term  rehab  program  or  changing  your  scene  to  get  away from  all  the  things  that  are  likely  to  get  you  using  again. 

Remember,  things  are  going  to  be  different  when  you're  no 

longer using and you'll need to plan for these changes.

Getting back on track if you 'slip up'

## Giving  up  amphetamines  is  not  easy.  Many  people  slip  up 

('lapse')  at  some  point  along  the  way.  Don't  be  too  hard  on yourself  if  you  do  slip  up  (use  when  you  didn't  want  to  or 

use  more  than  you  planned).  It  does  not  mean  you  have failed  or  that  you  have  lost  control,  but  it  is  a  sign  you  may

need  to  take  action  to  avoid  using  again.  Try  to  get  back  on track  straight  away  -  a  slip  doesn't  mean  you  have  to  go back to using the same as you did before withdrawal. Learn  from  your  lapse.  Think  about  what  happened  that  led you  to  use  this  time?  How  could  you  have  avoided  it?  What will you do next time in a similar situation? It's  true  that  some  people  who  start  withdrawal  do  get  back into  using  again  ('relapse').  Learning  to  read  the  warning signs  and  to  recognise  difficult  (high-risk)  situations  can  help you  avoid  going  back  to  your  old  patterns  of  use.  Some  peo­ ple  go  through  more  than  one  withdrawal  before  they  give up. Others need only one. If  you  do  use  again,  you  need  to  be  aware  of  a  few  things that  will  reduce  the  risk  of  harm  to  your  safety  and  your health: **•  Don't  use  as  much  as  before  -**your  tolerance  drops while  going  through  withdrawal  and  your  risk  of  over­ dose  increases  because  you  get  a  greater  effect  from using  less.  If  you  do  start  using  again,  don't  use  as  much as  you  did  before  -  your  body  may  not  be  able  to handle it. **•  Don't  mix  your  drugs  -**mixing  drugs  increases  your  risk of having problems, including overdose. **•  Test  a  new  supply  before  using  -**the  scene  may  have changed  while  you  have  not  been  using.  There  may  be different  gear  around  or  you  may  be  scoring  somewhere new.  Your  risk  of  problems  increases  if  you  aren't  sure about  the  strength  of  what  you're  getting.  Test  what you're using by having a small amount first.

**Don't  use  alone  -**if  something  goes  wrong  or  you  have 

a  severe  reaction,  being  on  your  own  can  make  you  feel 

much  worse.  Having  someone  with  you  means  you  have 

help in an emergency.

Remember safe using hints

## •  Wash your hands •  New fit every hit •  Don’t share fits, spoons, water, swabs, tourniquets 

or any injecting related equipment •  Don’t mix drugs with alcohol •  Don’t mix drugs •  Stay with the person if they are having a bad reaction •  Always ring an ambulance if you think someone has

overdosed or is having a severe reaction •  Don’t use alone

NOTES FOR SUPPORTERS

## Many  people  can  provide  support  to  a  person  withdrawing from  amphetamines.  Partners,  friends,  family  members, general  practitioners  and  counsellors  can  all  play  an  impor­ tant  role  during  the  withdrawal  period.  Providing  support and  reassurance  during  this  time  can  help  someone  through their withdrawal.

Supporting  someone  withdrawing  from  amphetamines  is 

not  always  an  easy  job.  There  may  be  occasions  when  sup­

porters  feel  unsure  of  how  to  help,  what  to  do  or  what  not to  do,  and  where  to  turn  when  things  aren't  going  smooth­

ly. There are, however, several important steps to follow. To  start,  become  familiar  with  what  happens  during  with­

drawal.  Read  the  contents  of  this  booklet  so  you  are  aware of  what  the  person  is  going  through  and  things  they  should 

be doing.

Someone  who  is  withdrawing  may  already  be  aware  of what  they  should  be  doing,  but  may  find  these  difficult  to 

remember  or  to  do.  Encourage  the  person  withdrawing, especially  when  they  are  going  through  difficult  periods,  and 

help  them  recognise  successes  throughout  their  with­ drawal.

During  difficult  periods,  it  is  useful  to  go  over  the  reasons why  the  person  initially  decided  to  stop  using  ampheta­

mines.  At  times,  they  may  not  feel  as  though  they  are  cop­

ing  and  may  waver  in  their  willingness  to  continue  the  with­

drawal.  Look  again  at  the  pros  (positives)  and  cons  (nega­ tives)  of  returning  to  drug  use.  This  may  help  them  be  clear on  the  benefits  of  returning  to  their  original  goal  of  getting through  the  withdrawal  period.  It  is  also  important  to  look  at 

how  far  they  have  already  come  and  to  remember  that  with­

drawal  passes  -  the symptoms may be  hard  to  cope with at 

the moment, but they will not go on forever.

There are times  when, as a  support  person, you may feel 

frustrated and impatient  with the person you  are helping. 

This is normal.  It is important  that  you  have  someone  to  talk 

to  and  get  support from. A friend, counsellor or  doctor can 

be  helpful.  If there are  times when  you are  unsure  of how 

to cope, get some advice.

There  are  confidential  drug  and alcohol telephone  coun­

selling  and  information  services  in all Australian  states, and 

they are a good way of getting further help.
