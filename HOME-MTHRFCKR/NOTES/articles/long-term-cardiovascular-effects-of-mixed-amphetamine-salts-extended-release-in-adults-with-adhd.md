## **Long-Tenn Cardiovascular Effects of** **Mixed Amphetamine Salts Extended** **Release in Adults With ADHD**

# By Richard H. Weisler, MD, Joseph Biederman, MD, Thomas J. Spencer, MD, and Timothy E. Wilens, MD

##### FOCUS POINTS_____________________________ •  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is a  chronic  neurobehavioral  condition  that  can  per­ sist into adulthood. •  Psychostimulants  are  recommended  as  first-line pharmacologic  agents  for  ADHD  symptom  man­ agement in children and adults. •  Psychostimulants  such  as  methylphenidate  and mixed  amphetamine  salts  exert  sympathomi­ metic  effects  that  can  lead  to  changes  in  cardio­ vascular parameters. •  Although  psychostimulant-induced  cardiovascu­ lar  changes  are  generally  not  clinically  significant in  pediatric  patients,  little  is  known  about  the cardiovascular effects of such agents in adults. •  In  this  study,  most  adults  with  ADHD  (in  whom major  medical  illness  and  cardiovascular  morbid­ ity  are  absent)  given  up  to  24  months  of  mixed amphetamine  salts  extended  release  (MAS  XR) 20-60 mg/day exhibited small and clinically insignifi­ cant average changes in cardiovascular parameters. •  The  small  number  of  cases  with  borderline  blood pressure or pulse  measures at baseline  who expe­ rienced clinically significant increases in such values with  MAS  XR  therapy  highlights  the  importance of  evaluating blood  pressure a nd pulse  at baseline and  periodically  during  therapy  so  that  treatment regimen can be adjusted in a timely manner.

**ABSTRACT______________________________** **Objective:** To assess long-term cardiovascular effects of  mixed  amphetamine  salts  extended  release  (MAS XR)  in  adults  with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disor­ der (ADHD) combined subtype. **Methods:** 223  otherwise  healthy  adults  (>18  years of age)  with ADHD  combined subtype  were exposed  to s24 months of MAS XR (20—60 mg/day). Resting sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse were measured at baseline and weekly, then  monthly  during  long-term  treatment.  Twelve-lead 

##### electrocardiograms were obtained at screening/baseline, 

weekly, then at 3- and 6-month intervals up to 24 months.

**Findings:** With  MAS **XR** 20-60  mg/day,  mean 

changes  in  DBP  (1.3±9.2  mm  Hg; P=.O42),  SBP 

(2.3±12.5  mm  Hg;  P=.006), and  pulse  (2.1±13.4 

bpm;   P=,019) were  small  and  not  clinically  significant. A  clinically  insignificant  increase  in  QTcB  (corrected 

by  Bazett’s  formula)  interval  (7.2  msec;  Pc.OOl) was 

observed at 24 months. No subject exhibited QTcB inter­

val >480  msec (QTcF [corrected by F ridericias formula] 

>454 msec). Seven subjects discontinued due to a car­ diovascular  adverse  event  (hypertension,  n-5,  palpita­

tion/tachycardia, n=2); none of these events was reported as serious. Few subjects with normal baseline vital signs 

(using approved parameters at the time of study initiation) exhibited clinically significant abnormalities at end point; several subjects with borderline baseline values exhibited shifts to abnormal values during MAS XR therapy.

**Conclusion:** Cardiovascular  effects  of  long-term MAS  XR  (<60 mg/day)  were  minimal  in  otherwise healthy  adults  with  ADHD.  Nevertheless,  vital  signs should  be  monitored  prior to and  during treatment with any stimulant.

### **INTRODUCTION______________________________**

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD) 

is  one  of  the  more  prevalent  chronic  health  condi­

tions  encountered  in p ediatrics,1,2 with  as many  as 2% 

to  18%  of  community  school-age  children  estimated 

to  be  affected.1  An  estimated  30%  to  65%  of  patients continue  to  experience  symptoms  into  adulthood.3'5 Awareness  of  adult  ADHD  is  growing  and  has  raised 

the  need  to  define  effective  and  well-tolerated  treat­

ment  options.  Currently,  psychostimulants  such  as 

amphetamines  or  methylphenidate  (MPH)  consti­

tute  first-line  pharmacologic  treatment  of  ADHD 

in  pediatric  and  adult  cases.6  Efficacy  in  adults  with 

immediate-release  (IR)  and  extended-release  (XR) formulations  of  MPH  and  mixed  amphetamine  salts

##### (MAS)  appears  to  be  comparable  to  that  seen  in children with ADHD.710 Stimulants  have  sympathomimetic  effects  that can  result  in  increases  in  systolic  blood  pressure (SBP),  diastolic  blood  pressure  (DBP),  and  pulse rate  at  therapeutic  doses.  However,  such  changes with  IR  amphetamine  and  MPH  formulations  in children  and  adolescents  are,  in  general,  clinically unremarkable.1112  A  scientific  statement  released by  the  American  Heart  Association  (AHA)  recom­ mended  determining  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure (BP)  at  baseline  and  on  follow-up  visits  for  children or  adolescents  receiving  IR  stimulant  medications; however,  the  guidelines  made  no  specific  recommen­ dations  for  electrocardiographic  (ECG)  monitoring with  stimulant  therapy.13  The  potential  for  harmful cardiovascular  effects  of  stimulant  use  in  children  and adults  has  also  been  highlighted  by  recent  regulatory actions  in  the  United  States  and  Canada.  In  2004,  a warning  label  was  placed  on  MAS  XR  stating  that amphetamine  misuse  or  use  by  patients  with  under­ lying  structural  cardiac  abnormalities  may  cause  sud­ den  death  or  serious  cardiovascular  events.  During 2005,  Health  Canada  briefly  removed  then  reinstated MAS  XR  in  the  Canadian  marketplace.  The  actions of  Health  Canada  prompted  a  US  Food  and  Drug Administration  re-review  of  the  postmarketing  data and  the  FDA  panel  concluded  that  the  rate  of  sudden death  in  12  pediatric  patients  treated  with  MAS  XR did  not  exceed  the  number  that  would  be  expected to  occur  in  children  (1-20  years  of  age)  even  without amphetamine  treatment  (~3.3  in  100,000  annually). The  FDA  panel  further  found  that  all  of  the  post­ marketing  cases  in  question  were  marked  by  under­ lying  structural  cardiac  abnormalities,  preexisting cardiovascular  disease,  a  family  history  of  ventricular tachycardia,  or  unusual  cardiovascular  stress,  or  drug misuse.  The  panel  recommended  no  further  regula­ tory  action;  subsequently,  in  August  2005,  Health Canada  reinstated  the  use  of  MAS  XR  throughout the Canadian market. These  cases  highlight  the  fact  that  cardiovascu­ lar  disease  or  its  history  often  goes  undetected  or noted  by  currently  treating  physicians;  in  adults  for instance  it  has  been  estimated  that  -1.7%  to  8.8% of  cases  with  evidence  of  ischemic  heart  disease  go unrecognized.14  They  also  highlight  the  timeliness and  importance  of  the  AHA  recommendations  to obtain  careful  patient  and  family  histories  regarding cardiovascular  conditions  in  patients  receiving  any type of psychostimulant therapy. The  cardiovascular  effects  of  stimulant  therapy in  adults  with  ADHD  are  less  well  characterized  but 

appear  to  be  similar  in  magnitude  to  those  changes seen  in  pediatric  patients.7,8  While  this  is  encourag­

ing,  much  more  research  is  required  to  fully  charac­ terize  the  cardiovascular  changes  and  potential  risks of  stimulant  therapy  in  adults  with  ADHD.  Such patients  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  changes  in  BP and  pulse  not  only  due  to  their  increasing  age  (typi­ cally  between  ages  35  and  40),  but  also  due  to  the potential  presence  of  medical  comorbidities,  such as  essential  hypertension  and  arteriosclerosis,  that may  go  undetected  even  during  careful  screening. Very  limited  research  has  been  conducted  on  the cardiovascular  effects  of  XR  stimulant  formulations. In  a  1-year  study  of  treatment  with  a  long-acting, osmotic-release  formulation  of  MPH  (18-54  mg/ day)  in  children  with  ADHD,  sustained  improve­ ments  in  ADHD  symptoms  were  not  accompanied by  any  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  BP  or  pulse 

(<4  mm  Hg  and  <4  beats  per  minute  [bpm],  respec­ tively).15  MAS  XR  has  been  formulated  for  oncedaily  dosing  via  the  inclusion  of  immediate-release and  delayed-release  pellets,16  with  therapeutic effects  persisting  for  up  to  12  hours.17  In  an  earlier report  from  a  short-term,  multicenter,  double-blind, forced-dose-escalation  study  in  adults  with  ADHD, MAS  XR  exhibited  a  safety  profile  similar  to  that reported  in  pediatric  studies.10  Herein,  we  present cardiovascular  assessments  obtained  among  sub­ jects  who  participated  in  the  short-term  study  and  a 24-month, open-label extension of that study.

### **METHODS_______________________________**

##### The  cardiovascular  safety  of  MAS  XR  in  the  man­ agement  of  adults  with  ADHD  was  examined  in  two phases:  a  4-week,  randomized,  double-blind,  multi­ center,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  forceddose-escalation  study  of  MAS  XR  20,  40,  and  60 mg/day10 and a 24-month open-label extension study.

**Subjects**

Subjects were male orfemale, al 8 years of age, diag­ nosed  with  ADHD  based  on Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fourth  Edition-Text Revision  (DSM-IV-TR)18  criteria  for  ADHD  com­ bined  type,  and  thought  to  be  in  good  physical  health at  short-term  study  entry.  Excluded w ere  subjects  with a history  of or  ongoing cardiovascular  disease, includ­ ing  history of  coronary artery  disease, angina pectoris, or  other  coronary  artery  disease  variant;  myocardial infarction;  bypass  surgery;  angioplasty;  or  any  clini­ cally  or  electrocardiographically  significant  cardiac or  vascular  abnormality.  A  BP  consistently  >139/89 mm  Hg,  heart  rate  consistently  <50  or  >120  bpm,  or

**Long-Term Cardiovascular Effects of MAS XR in Adults With ADHD**

##### a  requirement  for  concomitant  medications  that  could affect  heart  rate,  BP,  or  the  central  nervous  system also  were  exclusionary.  It  should  be  noted  that  the blood  pressure  and  pulse  thresholds  used  for  subject selection,  while  higher  than  what  is  considered  nor­ mal  among  physicians  today,  were  in  line  with  AHA guidelines  when  this  study  was  designed  and  imple­ mented. Subthreshold  anxiety or  depressive symptoms were  not  exclusionary,  but  subjects  with  comorbid psychiatric diagnoses  (eg, psychosis;  bipolar disorders; pervasive  developmental  disorder;  severe  obsessivecompulsive,  depressive,  or  anxiety  disorders;  history of suspected  substance abuse  or dependence  disorder [excluding  nicotine]  according  to  DSM-IV-TR  crite­ ria)  were  not  eligible  to  participate.  To  be  eligible  for the  extension  study,  subjects  were  required  to  have completed  at  least  1  week  of  double-blind  treatment in  the  short-term  study  without  experiencing  any  clin­ ically  important  adverse  events  that  would  preclude continued  exposure  to  MAS  XR.  Institutional  review boards at  each participating research  site a pproved all study procedures and  informed consent forms. All  sub­ jects voluntarily signed the informed consent form.

**Study Visits and Dosing** The  studies  were  designed  to  test  the  safety and  efficacy  of  MAS  XR  administered  once  daily at  doses  ranging  from  20  to  60  mg  in  adults  with ADHD.  During  the  initial  4-week  study,  subjects were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  MAS  XR  20, 40,  or  60  mg/day  in  a  forced-dose-escalation  man­ ner.  Study  visits  occurred  at  baseline  and  weekly during  this  time.  During  the  open-label  extension study,  visits  occurred  weekly  for  the  first  4  weeks  to assess safety  and tolerance, and  to adjust  dose levels if  necessary.  Thereafter,  visits  occurred  at  monthly intervals for up to 24 months. For  the  first  week  of  the  open-label  extension study,  all  subjects  initiated  MAS  XR  treatment  at 20  mg/day,  regardless  of  final  dose  in  the  double­ blind  study.  During  the  first  month  of  the  extension, the  study  dose  could  be  increased  by  the  investiga­ tor  in  20-mg  increments  up  to  40  or  60  mg/day  at the  weekly  visits.  Doses  could  be  increased  by  a  20mg  increment  at  the  month  2  visit  and  increased or  decreased  by  20-mg  increments  at  subsequent monthly  visits  based  on  the  investigator’s  judgment of  optimal  dose.  Optimal  dose  was  determined  by the  safety  (eg,  occurrence,  severity,  relationship of  adverse  events  to  MAS  XR)  and  effectiveness (ADHD Rating Scale scores19) of the drug.

**Cardiovascular Measures**

Cardiovascular  measures  included  resting/sitting 

SBP  and  DBP  and  resting/sitting  pulse  rate.  BPs 

were  measured  in  the  same  arm  by  the  same  study 

personnel  using  the  same  cuff  when  possible  (either 

manual  or  automated)  after  the  subject  had  been 

seated  for  at  least  3  minutes  at  every  study  visit. 

Measurements  were  taken  at  baseline  and  weekly 

during  the  short-term  study.  During  the  long-term 

study,  cardiovascular  measurements  were  taken  at 

baseline  (the  last  visit  of  the  short-term  study), 

weekly  during  the  first  month,  and  then  monthly 

up  to  24  months.  The  timing  of  vital  sign  assess­

ment  relative  to  medication  administration  was  not standardized;  however,  most  clinic  visits  were  likely 

to  have  occurred  within  12  hours  of  the  morning 

MAS XR dose.

ECG  measurements  were  performed  using  a  12-

lead  ECG.  For  the  short-term  study,  ECGs  were completed  at  the  screening  or  baseline  visit  (base­

line  ECG),  week  2,  and  again  at  the  final  study  visit 

(after  4  weeks  of  MAS  XR  treatment  or  at  the  final clinic  visit  if  a  participant  withdrew  from  the  study early).  The  end  point  ECG  from  the  short-term  study was  considered  the  baseline  ECG  for  the  long-term study;  repeat  ECGs  (timed  to  assess  subjects re ceiv­

ing  a  stable,  optimized  dose  for  at  least  1  month) were  conducted  at  months  3,  6,  12,  18,  and  24  (or upon  early  termination).  A  central  laboratory  was used  to  evaluate  all  ECG  readings  (Covance  Central Diagnostics,  Reno,  NV).  If  the  central  laboratory deemed  an  ECG  abnormal,  the  study  investigator evaluated  the  abnormality  for  clinically  significant changes  from  baseline.  If  the  investigator  consid­ ered  the  ECG  abnormality  to  be  clinically  signifi­ cant,  it  was  then  reviewed  by  a  cardiologist.  The Bazett  formula  was  used  to  correct  QT  intervals  for heart  rate  effect  (QTcB).20  BP,  pulse,  and  ECGs  were not  assessed  with  respect  to  time  of  medication  dose administration  or  in  relation  to  peak  blood  levels  of MAS XR in either study.

**Statistical Analyses**

Only  subjects  enrolled  in  the  4-week  double­ blind  study  were  eligible  to  participate  in  the 

24-month  open-label  extension  study.  Subject data  for  this  report  were  summarized  by  three  roll­ over  categories  from  the  short-term  double-blind study:  (1)  subjects  who  were  new  to  MAS  XR  (eg, MAS  XR  naive:  all  subjects  who  were  random­

ized  to  receive  placebo  in  the  short-term  study); 

(2)  subjects  who  received  uninterrupted  MAS  XR treatment  (eg,  MAS  XR  continuous:  all  subjects

##### whose  final  visit  of  the  short-term  study  served  as their  baseline  visit  for  the  long-term  study);  and  (3) subjects  who  received  interrupted  MAS  XR  treat­ ment  (eg,  MAS  XR  interrupted:  all  subjects  who experienced  a  disruption  in  MAS  XR  treatment for  any  reason  between  studies).  The  safety  sample included  all  subjects  who  enrolled  in  the  open-label extension  study  and  received  at  least  one  dose  of MAS  XR.  All  statistical  analyses  were  performed using  SAS®  for  Windows  Version  6.12  or  higher (SAS  Institute,  Cary,  NC).  The  baseline  visit  for the  open-label  extension  study  was  the  last  visit  of the  double-blind  treatment  phase  of  the  short-term study.  Vital  sign  and  ECG  data  were  summarized  by descriptive  statistics  and  by  rollover  category,  and mean  changes  from  baseline  to  each  postbaseline visit  and  end  point  (defined  for  any  given  subject  as the  last  valid  postbaseline  observation)  were  ana­ lyzed using one-sample paired t tests with a=.O5. Clinically  significant  and  abnormal  laboratory values,  vital  signs,  and  ECG  data  were  summarized in  addition  to  the  statistical  analysis  of  changes  from baseline.  A  predefined  limit  al  10  bpm  or  an  increase of  >25  bpm  relative  to  baseline  was  considered  clini­ cally  significant  for  individual  pulse  measurements. Individual  BP  measurements  >  150  mm  Hg  systolic (or  an  increase  of  >20  mm  Hg  relative  to  baseline) or  2=100  mm  Hg  diastolic  (or  an  increase  of  >10  mm Hg  relative  to  baseline)  at  any  study  visit  were  con­ sidered  clinically  significant.  Individual  changes  in QT,  QTcB,  or  QTcF  (corrected  by  Fridericia’s  for­ mula)  intervals  >30  msec  relative  to  baseline  values were  considered  clinically  noteworthy.21  Treatmentemergent  adverse  events,  drug-related  adverse events,  adverse  events  leading  to  study  discontinu­ ation,  and  serious  adverse  events  were  summarized using  Coding  Symbols  for  the  Thesaurus  of  Adverse Reaction  Terms  (COSTART)  terminology,  dose  at the  onset  of  the  adverse  event,  and  relationship  to MAS XR as judged by the investigator.

### **FINDINGS**

##### **Subjects** Subject  baseline  demographic  characteristics are  summarized  for  each  of  three  rollover  groups  in Table  1.  The  groups  were  demographically  similar, with  mean  age  ranging  from  39.5-42.7  years  and slightly  more  than  half  of  each  group  being  male. No  enrolled  subject  had  a  history  of  or  current  diag­ nosis  of  cardiovascular  disease.  Of  the  223  subjects who  enrolled,  147  (66%)  discontinued  the  study prior to completing 24 months of therapy with

MAS  XR.  Forty-eight  subjects  withdrew  because  of 

adverse  events,  38  withdrew  consent,  23  were  lost 

to  follow-up,  and  22  were  withdrawn  because  of 

protocol violations (typically noncompliance).

**MAS XR Long-term Dosing**

All  subjects  (N  =  223)  initiated  treatment  with 

MAS  XR  20  mg/day.  After  1  month  of  treatment, 

179  subjects  (80.3%)  had  achieved  a  dose  of  40  or 

60  mg/day.  This  dosing  level  was  also  seen  during 

the  remainder  of  the  study  period.  Beginning  at 

month  5  and  continuing  through  month  24,  s6% 

of  subjects  required  further  dosage  modification 

during their scheduled monthly clinic visit.

**Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure**

Mean  SBP  and  DBP  observed  during  24  months 

of  open-label  MAS  XR  treatment  are  shown  in 

Figure  1.  Mean  baseline  sitting  SBP  (119.8  mm 

Hg)  was  increased  beginning  at  month  8  and  occa­

sionally  emerged  as  statistically  significant  through 

month  24-  At  end  point,  statistically  significant,

line  SBP  (2.3±12.5  mm  Hg;  P=.006)  and  DBP 

(1.3+9.2  mm  Hg;  P=.O42)  were  seen.  The  change 

in  SBP  at  end  point  was  numerically  greater  but  not 

statistically  different  in  MAS  XR-naive  subjects 

(3.2  mm  Hg)  or  MAS  XR-interrupted  subjects  (3.5 

mm  Hg)  compared  with  subjects  in  the  MAS  XR-

continuous group (1.8 mm Hg).

**Pulse**

Mean  change  in  pulse  at  end  point  for  each of  the  rollover  groups  is  illustrated  in  Figure  2. Changes  from  baseline  pulse  at  end  point  were comparably  small  (^3  bpm)  among  all  of  the  roll­ over  groups.  A  clinically  insignificant  change  in mean  baseline  pulse  was  seen  at  end  point  for  the cohort as a whole (2.1 ± 13.4 bpm; P=.O19).

**Electrocardiogram Assessments**

Change  from  baseline  ECG  parameters  at  end point  for  each  of  the  rollover  groups  and  the  cohort 

as  a  whole  is  summarized  in  Table  2.  Between baseline  and  end  point,  the  group  mean  change 

in  the  PR  interval  was  statistically  significant  but not  clinically  important  (-5.9+14.1  msec;  IJ<.001). No  statistically  significant  change  occurred  in  the group  mean  QRS  interval  (-0.4±6.8  msec;  P=.375) was  observed.  No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in QT  interval  measurements  were  observed.  Small

##### observed;  however,  no  subject  had  a  QTcB  interval >480  msec  (QTcF  >454  msec).  At  end  point,  two subjects  demonstrated  a  change  from  baseline  QT 2:60  msec  and  three  subjects  demonstrated  a  change from  baseline  QTcB  a60  msec,  but  none  of  the  final values was >472 msec.

**Adverse Cardiovascular Events** Seven  subjects  were  withdrawn  from  the  study because  of  cardiovascular  adverse  events,  two  sub­ jects  because  of  palpitations  and/or  tachycardia  (MAS XR  dose  40  mg/day  in  both  cases),  and  five  subjects because of hypertension (MAS XR 20 mg/day, n=l;

40  mg/day,  n=l;  60  mg/day,  n=3).  Of  the  five  subjects 

withdrawn because  of hypertension,  three had  no his­

tory of hypertension. Four  of the five cases  with hyper­

tension  exhibited  unresolved  hypertension  during 

continued  follow-up,  which  suggests  the  development of  primary  essential  hypertension  in  these  four  sub­ jects.  An  estimated  50  million  people  in  the  US  have essential  hypertension,  and  the  rate  observed  here 

(1.8%)  appears  to  be  commensurate  with  the  esti­ mated  incidence  rate  of  essential  hypertension  in  the general  population,  as  reported  in  a  recent  Canadian study.22 Tachycardia/palpitations  resolved in  both sub­ jects who discontinued due to this adverse event.

##### exposure  (ie,  MAS  XR  naive,  MAS  XR  continuous, or  MAS  XR  interrupted).  There  was  no  difference 

between  rollover  categories  in  the  frequency  of  such 

abnormalities.  For  most  subjects  with  a  clinically 

significant  vital  sign  abnormality  at  any  study  visit 

(pulse  >110  bpm,  n=18;  SBP  2:150  mm  Hg,  n=17; 

DBP  >100  mm  Hg,  n=17;  QTcB  increase  2480  msec, 

n=0),  the  abnormality  was  seen  during  a  single  study 

visit and the subject remained in the study.

The  highest  pulse  measured  at  any  time  during 

the  study  (137  bpm)  was  seen  in  a  white  24-year old  female  at  month  4  (MAS  XR  40  mg/day).  This subject  had  tachycardia  at  baseline  and  several  post­ baseline  study  visits,  for  which  she  received  propran­ olol;  it  remained  unresolved  at  the  time  of  her  later withdrawal  from  the  study  due  to  weight  loss.  The highest  SBP  measured  (172  mm  Hg)  was  seen  in  a 

28-year-old  Asian  male  (MAS  XR  40  mg/day)  who had  elevated  BP  at  baseline  (152  mm  Hg);  he  later discontinued  due  to  worsening  hypertension.  The highest  DBP  measured  (118  mm  Hg;  month  5)  was seen  in  a  39-year-old  white  male  (MAS  XR  40  mg/ day)  who  had  elevated  DBP  (112  mm  Hg)  at  week

### **DISCUSSION____________________________**

(n=145)

##### This  is  the  first  detailed  assessment  of  cardio­

vascular  changes  in  adults  during  long-term  treat­

ment  with  an  XR  stimulant  formulation.  It  also  is 

the  largest  study  examining  the  long-term  effects 

of  a  stimulant  medication  in  adults  with  ADHD. 

For  the  majority  of  adult  subjects  in  this  study,  the 

average  cardiovascular  effects  of  MAS  XR  appear 

to  be  minimal  with  up  to  24  months  of  treatment. 

For  the  vast  majority  of  subjects,  mean  changes  in 

pulse,  BP,  and  ECG  interval  measurements  were 

not  clinically  significant.  A  small  number  of  sub­

jects  exhibited  significant  changes  from  baseline 

in  vital  signs  and  ECG  assessments.  However,  only 

seven  subjects  (7/223;  3.1%)  were  withdrawn  from 

the study because of a cardiovascular event.

The  current  analysis  is  significant  in  that  it  pro­

vides  the  first  substantial  evidence  demonstrat­

ing  that  long-term  stimulant  therapy  in  otherwise 

healthy  adults  with  ADHD  tends  to  cause  minimal 

changes  in  BP,  pulse,  and  ECG  parameters.  This  is 

particularly  important  given  the  increasing  vulner­

ability  to  elevated  BP  and  pulse  that  is  seen  with 

advancing  age.  In  general,  the  changes  in  cardiovas­

##### cular  parameters  observed  here  are  similar  in  mag­ nitude  to  those  reported  previously  with  MAS  XR among  pediatric  patients  with  ADHD.23  In  one  pre­ vious  investigation,  adolescents  treated  with  open­ label  once-daily  MAS  XR  (10-60  mg/day)  for  up to  6  months  exhibited  small,  clinically  insignificant mean  increases  at  end  point  in  baseline  SBP  (1.7 mm  Hg),  DBP  (0.6  mm  Hg),  and  pulse  (4.4  bpm). Similarly,  the  current  findings  are  in  line  with  a recent  report  describing  changes  in  heart  rate  and BP  observed  in  a  number  of  small,  short-term  clini­ cal  trials  of  stimulant  and  nonstimulant  medications in  adults  with  ADHD.7  8  In  the  analysis  by  Wilens and  colleagues,'8  small  changes  in  SBP,  DBP,  and pulse were  reported and  no differences  were detected between  MPH  and  amphetamine  or  any  of  the  other agents  examined.8  Importantly,  we  observed,  as  did Wilens  and  colleagues,8  that  normotensive  ADHD adults  appear  to  tolerate  the  minor  cardiovascular effects  of  stimulant  medications  well.  In  most  cases here,  abnormal  vital  sign  values  were  observed  at  a single  study  visit,  resolved  spontaneously,  and  did not  require  any  change  in  dose  or  withdrawal  from the  study.  Wilens  and  colleagues8  noted  that  the presence  of  hypertension  at  end  point  was  predicted by  higher  BPs  at  baseline,  suggesting  the  need  to assess vital  signs at  baseline prior  to beginning stimu ­ lant  therapy.  This  is  also  in  line  with  current  AHA guidelines  for  pediatric  patients  receiving  stimulant therapy13  and  constitutes  prudent  clinical  practice. Patients  with  abnormal  cardiovascular  indices  can be  safely  excluded  from  or  flagged  for  close  follow-up with  stimulant  therapy,  whereas  those  with  mildly abnormal  cardiovascular  indices  can  be  more  vigi­ lantly monitored. Frequency  or  incidence  of  clinically  significant changes  and  abnormalities  seen  here  was  slightly greater  than  seen  previously  among  adolescents with  MAS  XR.21  For  any  given  vital  sign  or  ECG parameter,  10-18  adult  subjects  met  criteria  for  a clinically  significant  abnormality  at  any  time  dur­ ing  this  study.  Although  such  abnormalities  may  be at  least  partially  due  to  the  stimulant  medication under  study,  it  also  seems  likely  to  be  related  to  the adult  population  involved  in  this  investigation.  In several  cases,  cardiovascular  abnormalities  were observed  at  baseline  of  the  open-label  study.  One white  female  exhibited  tachycardia  at  baseline  that remained  unresolved  during  open  MAS  XR  treat­ ment;  she  later  discontinued  the  study  due  to  weight loss.  A  second  subject,  an  Asian  male,  exhibited  an elevated  SBP  at  baseline  (152  mm  Hg);  this  wors­ ened during open MAS XR therapy (up to 172 mm

Hg)  and  led  to  his  discontinuation  from  the  study  at 

month  3.  Similarly,  a  29-year-old  white  man  devel­

oped  elevated  DBP  at  week  2  of  open  treatment 

(112  mm  Hg),  which  worsened  with  continuing 

treatment  (118  mm  Hg);  he  was  later  discontin­

ued  due  to  noncompliance.  Underlying  pathology 

(eg,  atherosclerosis,  borderline  hypertension)  may 

have  gone  undetected  at  initial  evaluation  in  some 

subjects,  and  these  individuals  may  have  been 

more  vulnerable  to  the  sympathomimetic  effects  of 

MAS  XR.  Moreover,  increasing  age  is  associated 

with  increased  risk  of  hypertension  and  cardiovas­

cular  events.  Given  the  lack  of  a  placebo-control 

group  in  the  current  open-label  investigation,  the 

rate  at  which  cardiovascular  abnormalities  emerge 

among  adults  with  ADHD  who  are  not  receiv­

ing  stimulant  medication  could  not  be  character­

ized.  In  a  recent  study  by  Wilens  and  colleagues,23 

hypertension  (>140/90  mm  Hg)  emerged  in  8% 

of  subjects  during  short-term  monitoring.  Further 

investigation  is  required  to  determine  the  extent 

to  which  the  clinically  significant  events  seen  here 

were  related  to  underlying  risks  versus  stimulant 

therapy.  Nevertheless,  these  cases  highlight  the 

importance  of  evaluating  BP  and  pulse  at  baseline 

and  the  need  to  monitor  vital  signs  during  the  early phase  of  medication  dose  titration.  The  findings 

of  this  study  indicate  that  patients  with  borderline 

BP  or  pulse  values  are  at  risk  for  developing  vital 

sign  abnormalities  with  stimulant  therapy  and  may 

require  adjustments  to  their  treatment  regimen  if clinically significant abnormalities should develop.

**Limitations**

The  results  presented  here  are  from  an  analysis of  a  long-term,  open-label  extension  study  that  was designed  to  demonstrate  the  overall  safety  and  effi­ cacy  of  MAS  XR.  Subjects  enrolled  were  required  to have normal BP and  pulse on study entry,  and subjects with  hypertension  (consistently  elevated  BP  >139/89 mm  Hg)  or  any  other  cardiovascular  disorder  were excluded  from  participation.  Because  of  this  criterion, the  current  findings  may  not  generalize  to  the  broader population  of  adults  with  ADHD  who  present  with medical  comorbidities,  including  hypertension.  Recent evidence  suggests,  however,  that  even  adult  patients with  hypertension  that  requires  management  with antihypertensive  medication  are  able  to  tolerate  MAS XR without  a significant  elevation in  BP. This  suggests 

it  is  safe  to  co-manage  ADHD  and  hypertension  and presents  a  possible  option  for  patients  who  exhibit elevated  BP  at  baseline,  rather  than  excluding  such patients  from  stimulant  therapy.24  The  effects  of  short-

**Long-Term Cardiovascular Effects of MAS XR in Adults With ADHD**

##### or  long-term  use  of  MAS  XR  in  patients  with  signifi­ cant  cardiovascular  dysfunction  or  BP  abnormalities are  unknown.  The  study  population  included  adults who  were  not  receiving  any  other  medications  that could  affect  BP  or  pulse.  The  addition  of  XR  stimulant formulations  to  other  medications  with  cardiovascular effects  in  adults  with  ADHD  has  not  been  assessed. Lack  of  standardization  in  the  timing  of  medication administration and assessment of vital signs could have resulted  in  measurements  after  the  medication  effects had  worn  off,  but  this  is  unlikely  given  that  few  clinic visits would have occurred >12 hours after dosing.

**CONCLUSION________________________________** The  cardiovascular  effects  of  MAS  XR  appear minimal  in  patients  with  ADHD  who  are  otherwise in  good  physical  health;  they  are  similar  to  those reported  for  pediatric  patients  and  with  both  short  and  long-acting  amphetamines  and  methylphenidate, as  well  as  the  nonstimulant  atomoxetine.  While  the AHA  guidelines  regarding  the  evaluation  of  heart rate  and  BP  at  baseline  and  during  follow-up  pertain to  children  and  adolescents,  we  believe  these  same guidelines  should  apply  to  adults  as  well.  Given  the incidence  of  hypertension  and  cardiovascular  disease seen  in  adults,  routine  monitoring  of  vital  signs  at baseline  and  periodically  throughout  treatment  in adults  with  ADHD  is  recommended.  The  FDA  and Health  Canada  have  both  issued  guidelines  regard­ ing  the  use  of  stimulants  in  patients  thought  to  have structural cardiac abnormalities. K2££]
