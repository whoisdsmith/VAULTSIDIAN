## Resources

Since the emergence of the LOD Cloud in 2007 DBpedia constitutes the main resource of Linked Open Data on the Web containing more than 228 million entities to date. With the rapid growth of published LOD-datasets DBpedia evolved to the most interconnected freely available knowledge graph on the Web. Out of its popularity, numerous further resources emerged and have been created by and for research and industry for various purposes. As of today, a large community of Linked Data enthusiasts is continuously contributing

to the advancement of DBpedia. As a result, the main DBpedia Knowledge Graph encompassing cleaned data from Wikipedia in all languages and Wikidata reaches over 600k file downloads per year.

Discover and use the numerous DBpedia-related datasets and tools that have been developed providing data access, versioning, quality control, ontology visualization, linking infrastructures, and much more!
