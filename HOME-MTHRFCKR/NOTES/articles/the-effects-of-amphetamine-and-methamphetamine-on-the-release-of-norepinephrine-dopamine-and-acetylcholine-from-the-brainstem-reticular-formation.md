**INTRODUCTION** Amphetamine  (AMPH)  and  mostly  methamphetamine 

# (METH)  are  widely  abused  psychostimulants,  which  possess a  phenylethylamine  structure.  In  the  present  review  article, we  focus  on  both  compounds,  which,  from  now  on  are referred  to  as  AMPHs  meant “sensu  stricto”  to  rule  out  other amphetamine-related  compounds.  Both  acute  and  chronic AMPHs  intake/administration  determines  behavioral,  purely motor,  and  vegetative  alterations;  each  effect  relies  on  a  quite specific  constellation  of  reticular  nuclei,  which  often  overlap. This  calls  for  a  constant  reference  to  the  functional  anatomy of  the  brainstem  reticular  formation  (RF),  which  stands  as  the seminal  brain  area  to  comprehend  the  neurobiology  of  AMPHs. Short-term effects  of AMPHs  include intense  euphoria, increased heart  rate,  hypertension,  hyperthermia,  excitation,  alertness  and wakefulness (Meredith  et al.,  2005; Homer  et al.,  2008; Moratalla et al., 20 17), which can  be related to  specific groups of  brainstem nuclei.  On  the  other  hand,  reiterated  intake/administration  of AMPHs  produces  long-lasting  alterations,  which  may  be  the consequence  of  neurotoxicity  or  being  produced  by  persistent epigenetic  changes  driving  marked  plastic  phenomena  in some  brain  areas  (Battaglia  et  al.,  2002;  Robison  and  Nestler, 2011;  Godino  et  al.,  2015;  Limanaqi  et  al.,  2018).  Behavioral alterations  include  motor  and  psychiatric  effects  such  as  hyper­ locomotion,  stereotypies,  addiction,  craving,  aggressiveness, anorexia,  psychosis,  depression,  cognitive  impairments,  and altered  cortical  excitability  ranging  from  sleep  alterations  up to  seizures  (Meredith  et  al.,  2005;  Brown  et  al.,  2011;  Marshall and  O’Dell,  2012;  Moratalla  et  al.,  2017).  All  these  effects vary  over  time  following  reiterated  exposure  and  some  of them  occur  as  the  consequence  of  neurotoxicity  or  the  onset of  “neuronal  sensitization”  (Robinson  and  Berridge,  2000). In  fact,  when  administered  chronically  and/or  at  high  doses, AMPHs  and  mostly  METH  produce  toxicity  in  specific  brain regions  or  even  in  peripheral  organs,  especially  those  receiving dense  innervation  by  the  sympathetic  nervous  system  (Liu and  Varner,  1996;  Albertson  et  al.,  1999;  Darke  et  al.,  2008; Volkow  et  al.,  2010;  Thanos  et  al.,  2016).  Most  of  the  effects induced  by  AMPHs  are  grounded  on  the  powerful  release of  a  variety  of  neurotransmitters,  which  occurs  through  a mechanism  owning  a  fair  anatomical  specificity.  The  lateral column  of  the  brainstem  RF  contains  neuronal  populations, which  possess  common  molecular  targets  characterizing  specific neuronal phenotypes. These very same targets are recruited quite selectively  by  AMPHs  administration **(Figure** 1).  In  fact,  the chemical  structure  of  AMPHs  is  characterized  by  an  aromatic ring  and  a  nitrogen  on  the  aryl  side-chain  (Biel  and  Bopp, 

Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | ======www.frontiersin==.org====**2**====May 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 48

## 1978),  which  recapitulates  most  monoamine  neurotransmitters including  catecholamines  (dopamine,  DA,  norepinephrine, NE,  epinephrine,  E)  and  indoleamines  (serotonin,  5-HT, tryptamine  and  other  trace  amines;  Heal  et  al.,  2013).  In the  light  of  a  cross  affinity,  AMPHs  behave  as  a  competitive substrate  for  monoamine  transporters  including  NE  transporter 

## (NET),  DA  transporter  (DAT)  and  5-HT  transporter  (SERT; Rothman  and  Baumann,  2003;  Fleckenstein  et  al.,  2007;  Sitte and  Freissmuth,  2015).  This  is  the  reason  why  AMPHs  target quite  selectively  those  neurons,  which  produce  monoamine as  neurotransmitters.  Such  a  simple  concept  explains  why  the RF  is,  at  large,  the  target  brain  region  for  the  mechanism  of action  of  AMPHs.  Likewise,  we  focus  this  review  on  this  very same  area  to  analyze  in  depth  those  effects  not  fully  explained by  DA  neurons  which  are  hosted  in  the  high  mesencephalic reticular  nuclei.  In  detail,  most  monoamine-containing  nuclei of  the  ponto-medullary  RF  are  placed  in  a  quite  restricted  brain region  corresponding  to  the  median  and  lateral  column  of  the RF  of  the  brainstem.  The  basis  for  both  short-  and  long-term behavioral,  motor  and  vegetative  effects  of  AMPHs  stems  from such  a  selective  uptake  and  common  intracellular  targets  of AMPHs  within  these  monoamine-containing  neurons  (Bucci et  al.,  2017).  These  neurons  produce  widespread  innervation of  a  variety  of  limbic,  motor  and  iso-cortical  areas  where ultimately  the  effects  of  AMPHs  are  produced.  In  fact,  at sub-cellular  levels,  the  targets  of  AMPHs  are  both  the  cell  body and  mostly,  the  axon  terminal.  The  latter  represents  the  primary AMPHs’  target.  In  fact,  the  powerful  release  of  monoamines relies  on  the  effects  of  AMPHs  on  axon  varicosities,  where monoamines  are  concentrated  in  baseline  conditions.  AMPHs massively  release  neurotransmitters  in  high  amount,  which can  be  quantitatively  assessed  by  placing  microdialysis  probes within  all  brain  regions  innervated  by  monoamine  neurons. At  the  same  time,  this  can  be  correlated  with  a  number  of systemic  effects,  which  are  mediated  by  each  brain  region under  a  powerful  reticular  monoamine  innervation.  In  fact, following  AMPHs  there  are  dramatic  changes  in  breathing, blood  pressure,  locomotor  activity,  muscle  tone,  sleep-wake cycle,  mood,  orienting  to  novelty,  arousal,  anxiety,  reward along  with  innumerous  vegetative  and  somatic  phenomena occurring  in  the  human  body.  A  great  amount  of  investigations, commentary  manuscripts  and  books  focused  on  the  effects of  AMPHs  abuse  on  DA-containing  neurons  within  the mesencephalon (Seiden et al., 1976;  Wagner et al., 1979; Nielsen et  al.,  1983;  Di  Chiara  and  Imperato,  1988;  Sonsalla  et  al., 

## 1989;  Cadet  et  al.,  1994;  Delle  Donne  and  Sonsalla,  1994; Fornai  et  al.,  1997,  2001;  Battaglia  et  al.,  2002;  Ferrucci  et  al., 2008; Moratalla et al., 2017). Instead, the contribution of low

**FIGURE** 1 | The molecular mechanisms of amphetamine(s) (AMPHs) in monoamine-containing neurons, (i) The primary molecular target, which provides neuronal selectivity for AMPHs, consists in the plasma membrane transporter. In fact, AMPHs behave as competitive substrates for the re-uptake through the NE transporter (NET), dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) and 5-HT transporter (SERT; Rothman and Baumann, 2003; Fleckenstein et al., 2007). These transporters normally work by taking up extracellular monoamines to the axoplasm, which is the main mechanism to terminate their activity (Iversen et al., 1965; Axelrod and Kopin, 1969; Coyle and Axelrod, 1971; Aggarwal and Mortensen, 2017). Cross-affinity between AMPHs and neurotransmitters contributes to generate the quite selective storage of AMPHs within specific neurons. Once bound to the plasma membrane transporter, AMPHs enter the axoplasm while reverting the transport direction (Sulzer et al., 1993). This occurs mostly for catecholamine neurons since AMPHs strongly discriminate between SERT, to which they bind with much lower affinity (500-fold less) compared with DAT and NET (Rothman and Baumann, 2003). In particular, AMPHs bind to the NET with five-to-nine-fold higher affinity compared with the DAT (Rothman and Baumann, 2003). This is the main reason why AMPHs release NE more potently than DA and much more than 5-HT (Rothman et al., 2001). (ii) Within monoamine axons, AMPHs encounter a second specific target called vesicular monoamine transporter type-2 (VMAT-2), which is also shared with monoamines. In this way, AMPHs enter the synaptic vesicles. At this level, AMPHs impair the acidification of the vesicle, which generates an acidic pH (Sulzer and Rayport, 1990; Sulzer et al., 1993,1995). This acidic environment is erased by AMPHs, which rise the vesicular pH value from 4 up to 7, which corresponds to a 1,000-fold increase in the concentration of H+ ions. Thus, monoamines, which are weak bases, are charged at low pH, while at a neutral pH lose their charge, and diffuse through the vesicle membrane, thus massively invading the axoplasm (Brown et al., 2000, 2002; Pothos et al., 2000). In this way, axonal monoamines either passively or via a reverted plasma membrane transporter fill extracellular space where they reach a massive concentration (Sulzer et al., 1995, 2005). (iii) The third molecular target, which is impaired by AMPHs, is the mitochondrial-bound enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). Both MAO-A/-B iso-enzymes oxidatively deaminate DA, NE and 5-HT. Nonetheless, MAO-A/-B isoforms differ in substrate preference, inhibitor affinity and regional distribution within either single neurons or different animal species (Robinson et al., 1977; Youdim, 1980; Sourkes, 1983; Gesi et al., 2001; Youdim et al., 2006; Bortolato et al., 2008). These differences are seminal to explain the specific effects of AMPHs within various monoamine neurons. In fact, MAO-A, are competitively inhibited by methamphetamine (METH) with a 10-fold higher affinity compared with MAO-B. MAO-A is placed within synaptic terminals of DA and NE neurons, while MAO-B are the only isoform operating within 5-HT terminals and non-catecholamine neurons. Thus, apart from rats and a few animal species, the effect of AMPHs on the amount of extracellular monoamines is remarkable concerning NE and DA, being less pronounced for 5-HT.

brainstem  nuclei  is  much  less  investigated  and,  apart  from  the Locus  Coeruleus  (LC),  only  a  few  manuscripts  investigated the  recruitment  of  the  variety  of  catecholamine  neurons within  the  low  brainstem  during  AMPHs  administration. Despite  not  being  widely  investigated,  this  point  deserves very  much  attention  since  the  specific  functional  anatomy  of these  nuclei  may  lead  to  comprehension  of  the  brainstemrelated  nature  of  a  variety  of  AMPHs-induced  alterations. Therefore,  in  the  present  review  article,  we  avoid  the  analysis of  DA  neurons  of  the  Substantia  Nigra  pars  compacta  (SNpc) and  Ventral  Tegmental  Area  (VTA),  and  focus  instead  on catecholamine  nuclei  of  the  low  brainstem.  In  particular,  we focus  on  NE  nuclei  located  within  the  lateral  column  of  the

## bulbo-pontine  RF  and  a  mixed  neuronal  population  within the  dorsal  raphe/periaqueductal  gray  (PAG),  which  contains  a subset  of  NE  and  DA  neurons  (Battenberg  and  Bloom,  1975; Saavedra et al., 1976; Steinbusch et al., 1981; Nieuwenhuys et al.,

We  also overview  cholinergic cells placed  in  the  lateral  column  of  the  pontine  RF,  which  extend up  to  the  lateral  wings  of  the  dorsal  raphe  (Satoh  et  al.,  1983; Nieuwenhuys  et  al.,  2007;  Vasudeva  and  Waterhouse,  2014; de  Oliveira  et  al.,  2016).  In  detail,  the  dorsal  raphe  contains 5-HT  neurons  in  all  nuclear  regions,  while  catecholamine  and acetylcholine  cells  are  placed  in  the  most  rostral  extent  of  the dorsal raphe both in rodents and humans (Saavedra et al., 1976;

Ferrucci et al.Amphetamines and Brainstem Reticular Nuclei

Steinbusch  et  al.,  1981;  Baker  et  al.,  1990,  1991;  Nieuwenhuys et  al.,  2007;  Mai  and  Paxinos,  2012;  Li  et  al.,  2016;  Cho  et  al., 2017).  As  shown  by  pioneer  studies,  the  amount  of  NE  neurons in  the  dorsal  raphe  is  remarkable,  being  about  one-third  of 

## 5-HT  neurons.  Instead,  the  amount  of  DA  cells  is  roughly  a half  compared  with  NE  neurons,  at  least  in  the  rat  (Saavedra et  al.,  1976).  While  the  median  ventral  PAG  contains  a  few 5-HT  neurons,  both  NE  and  DA  neurons  are  placed  in  the ventral/ventrolateral  corner  of  the  PAG  (Hokfelt  et  al.,  1984; Dougalis et  al., 2012;  Mai and  Paxinos, 2012).  DA cells  occurring within  this  brain  region  are  known  as  AlOdc  (dorsal  central)  in order  to  distinguish  them  from  the  adjacent  VTA  DA  neurons 

## (Hokfelt  et  al.,  1984).  Again,  NE  neurons  placed  at  this  level represent  the  dorsal  and  rostral  extent  of  the  LC  complex.  This rostral  extent  was  described  in  humans  as  nucleus  epicoeruleus by  Mai  and  Paxinos  (2012).  In  addition  to  the  presence  of NE-containing  neurons,  the  dorsal  raphe  receives  a  powerful NE  innervation.  This  is  supported  by  findings  in  humans,  where the  amount  of  NET  in  the  ventral  nuclei  of  the  dorsal  raphe matches  the  amount  of  NET  which  can  be  measured  within the  LC  (Ordway  et  al.,  1997).  There  is  a  remarkable  affinity of  AMPHs  for  NET  compared  with  DAT  and  SERT.  In  fact, AMPHs  administration  produces  a  more  powerful  release  of NE  compared  with  DA  (Rothman  et  al.,  2001;  Weinshenker and  Schroeder,  2007;  Schmidt  and  Weinshenker,  2014).  This means  that  behavioral  effects  induced  by  AMPHs  in  various animal  species  including  humans  can  be  partly  explained  by massive  NE  release  (Rothman  et  al.,  2001;  Weinshenker  et  al., 2002;  Weinshenker  and  Schroeder,  2007).  Thus,  despite  a DA  solely-based  perspective  about  AMPHs  and  behavior,  NE creeps  back  in  participating  to  AMPHs-induced  behavioral changes.  This  calls f or dissecting  further anatom ical areas  within NE-containing  brainstem  nuclei  to  comprehend  the  effects induced  by  AMPHs,  along  with  considering  the  anatomical connections  linking  the  bulbo-pontine  with  the  mesencephalic RF  as  a  biological  substrate,  which  may  sustain  a  key  circuitry mediating the effects of AMPHs. **THE FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE**

# AMPHs  with  specific  NE  nuclei  of  the  brainstem,  a  preliminary synthetic  overview  of  the  neuroanatomy  of  these  nuclei  appears to  be  mandatory.  This  will  make  it  easier  to  orient  within  the brainstem  when  referring  to  the  site-specificity  of  the  effects induced by AMPHs.

## **NE-Containing Reticular Nuclei**

# Catecholamine-containing  nuclei  are  mainly  housed  within the  lateral  extent  of  the  RF **(Figure  2).** A  very  recent original  manuscript  provided  stereological  morphometry  data encompassing  all  brainstem  reticular  catecholamine  nuclei  at one  glance  (Bucci  et  al.,  2017).  These  include  NE  neurons  of the  pons  and  medulla,  which  were  identified  by  using  TH

## refer  to  NE-containing  nuclei  and  we  will  include  the  E-related 

## sub-nuclei as a putative attribute, since most  of them are believed 

## to  represent  a  continuum  with  NE  areas.  This  is  the  case  of 

## nuclear  complexes  known  as  A/C  nuclear  groups,  where  the 

## letter  “A”  indicates  NE  neurons  and  the  letter  “C”  indicates  E 

## neurons  (Hokfelt  et  al.,  1974).  The  Al/Cl  cell  group  is  placed  in 

## the  sub-pial  aspect  of  the  rostral  ventrolateral  medulla  (RVLM). 

## The  A2/C2,  also  known  as  dorsomedial  cell  group  appears 

## medially  on  the  floor  of  the  IV  ventricle.  Reticular  neurons 

## of  A2/C2  intermingle  with  neurons  of  the  dorsal  nucleus  of 

## the  vagus  (DMV)  and  nucleus  of  the  solitary  tract  (NTS)  to 

## constitute  an  overlapped,  neuromelanin  pigmentated  area,  which 

## is named  ala cinerea.  The posterior  region of  ala cinerea  extends 

## towards  the  obex  to  constitute  the  area  postrema  (AP),  which 

## corresponds  approximately  to  the  chemoreceptor  trigger  zone 

## (CTZ;  Potes  et  al.,  2010).  A3/C3  area  is  still  poorly  investigated 

## due  to  species  variability  (Howe  et  al.,  1980;  Vincent,  1988; 

## Paxinos  et  al.,  1995;  Menuet  et  al., 2014). S imilarly, f ragmentary 

## information  deals  with  the  A4  nucleus  once  believed  to  occur 

## only  in  primates  though  it  was  recently  identified  in  rodents 

## (Bucci  et  al.,  2017).  The  A5  nucleus  is  placed  ventrally  in  the 

## pons,  close  to  the  roots  of  the  facial  nerve.  Moving  towards 

## the  dorsal  and  medial  aspect  of  the  pons,  these  neurons  form 

## a  continuum  with  other  NE  neurons  belonging  to  the  A6sc 

## (nucleus  subcoeruleus)  and  A6  (locus  coeruleus,  LC)  nuclei. 

## A5 and  A6 (LC)  represent the  primary sources  of NE  afferents to 

## the  VTA  and  Al/Cl  (Bucci  et  al.,  2017).  The  A7  nucleus  (lateral 

## lemniscus  nucleus)  is  placed  in  the  pons,  immediately  lateral 

## to  the  rostral  end  of  the  parabrachial  (PB)  nucleus.  A6  (LC)  is 

## the  biggest  NE-containing  nucleus  within  the  central  nervous 

## system  (CNS)  and  it  is  located  in  the  upper  part  of  the  floor  of 

## the  IV  ventricle,  within  the  pons.  NE-containing  neurons  of  LC, 

## together  with  A6sc  and  the  scattered  TH-positive  cells  within 

## the  medial  PB  form  a  tube-shaped  continuum,  which  is  named 

## LC  complex.  The  A4  area,  when  present,  can  be  considered 

## within  this  complex  as  well  (Bucci  et  al.,  2017).  In  humans, 

## the  LC  complex  also  includes  the  nucleus  epicoeruleus,  which 

## occurs  in  the  rostral  dorsal  raphe,  within  the  ventrolateral  PAG 

## (Mai and Paxinos, 2012).

## Neurons  belonging  to  the  LC  region  profusely  send  their

## NE  to  the  brain,  and  mostly,  to  the  whole  cerebral  cortex 

## (Loughlin  et  al.,  1982).  In  addition,  the  fine  neuroanatomy  of 

## NE  (and  catecholamine)  fibers  possesses  typical  features.  In 

## fact,  apart  from  the  marked  spreading  of  axonal  projections 

## due  to  profuse  collateralization,  which  is  typical  for  neurons 

## forming  the  isodendritic  core  of  the  RF,  axon  collaterals  are

**FIGURE 2 |** An anatomical overview of the brainstem reticular formation (RF). This cartoon provides a synthetic overview of the neuroanatomy of brainstem RF nuclei in order to foster orientation within the brainstem when referring to the site-specificity of the effects induced by AMPHs. Monoamine-containing nuclei are placed in a quite restricted brain region corresponding to the median and lateral column of the brainstem RF. In detail, the median column hosts 5-HT-containing nuclei (yellow), which extend along the medulla and pons to reach the mesencephalon at the level of the periaqueductal gray (PAG). 5-HT containing nuclei at this level represent the rostral extent of the dorsal raphe nucleus (B8-B9). Since an analysis of 5-HT neurons in the effects of AMPHs is beyond the scope of the present review article, we focus on the dorsal raphe nucleus just concerning the PAG region, which contains catecholamine neurons. In fact, the PAG hosts a mixed population of catecholamine and acetylcholine (ACh)-containing nuclei which are placed in the lateral column of the RF. This is the case of DA (violet), NE (green) and ACh (red) nuclei which represent the rostral extent of Al 0 Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA), A6 (LC) and CH6, respectively. Moving downstream to the mesencephalic DA nuclei (A8, A9, A10), a constellation of nuclei appears within the lateral column of RF. These include the two pontine ACh nuclei (Ch5 and Ch6) and a number of NE nuclei placed along the ponto-medullary RF, namely A6 (LC), A6sc (subcoeruleus), A7 which intermingles with NE neurons of the rostral PB nucleus (here represented as a continuum), A5, A4, and two mixed NE/E-containing groups in the medulla, namely Al/Cl [rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM)j and A2/C2 (dorsomedial cell group), which extends towards the obex within the AP (area postrema). The A7 neurons together with PB-NE neurons and the A5 nucleus contribute to define the Kolliker-Fuse nucleus (blue circle, Milner et al., 1986; Byrum and Guyenet, 1987). The A6 nucleus together with the A6sc, the medial PB in the rostral pons and the epicoeruleus nucleus within the PAG, constitute the LC complex.

paracrine effects,  even distant  from the  release site via a  volume transmission.  Altogether,  these  features  synergize  to  produce extremely  widespread  effects  following  AMPHs  activation of NE nuclei. **The Role of NE Nuclei in AMPHs-lnduced** **Behavioral Effects** NE  is  key  in  mediating  behavioral  correlates  effects  of AMPHs.  Specifically,  NE  sourcing  from  the  RF  strongly modulates  AMPHs-induced  behaviors  and  reward,  which  is the  pre-requisite  for  sustaining  reinforcing  behavior  leading to  AMPHs  addiction.  In  fact,  reiteration  of  drug  intake induces  plastic  changes  within  specific  neuronal  systems,  which are  necessary  to  develop  craving  and  addiction  (Pierce  and Kumaresan,  2006).  In  this  paragraph,  specific  reticular  NE nuclei  will  be  related  to  rewarding  effects  induced  by  AMPHs. From  a  general  viewpoint,  NE  mediates  a  large  amount  of  the 

## rewarding  effects  induced  by  AMPHs  as  shown  early  in  the  ‘60s 

## (Poschel and  Ninteman, 1963;  Stein, 1964;  Sofuoglu and  Sewell, 

## 2009).  This  occurred  in  the  context  of  the  “Catecholamine 

## theory  of  reward”  (Hanson,  1966;  Crow  et  al.,  1972;  Crow, 

## 1972,  1973;  Wise,  1978),  where  NE  was  thought  to  be  the m ain 

## neurotransmitter  to  produce  reward  following  a  variety  of 

## psychostimulants.  In  line  with  this,  drugs  reducing  NE  activity 

## (by  depleting  NE  stores,  or  inhibiting  NE  synthesis,  or  damaging 

## NE  axons)  were  shown  to  dampen  intracranial  self-stimulation 

## (ICSS),  which  was  used  as  an  experimental  model  for  reward 

## (Fibiger  and  Phillips,  1974).  A  more  detailed  knowledge  about 

## the  anatomy  of  the  low  brainstem  RF  provided  the  substrate  to 

## confirm  the  contribution  of  NE  nuclei  to  the  neurobiology 

## of  reward  induced  by  psychostimulants  (Wise,  1978; 

## Ordway  et  al.,  1997;  Weinshenker  and  Schroeder,  2007). 

## For  instance,  positive  self-stimulation  sites  exist  in  the  LC 

## (A6) as well as along ascending NE pathways. These include:

**FIGURE 3 |** NE-containing neurons of the RF: from gross anatomy to the fine iso-dendritic nature. NE-containing neurons of the RF profusely branch their axons to release NE throughout the whole central nervous system (CNS) and the autonomic nervous system. This is grounded on the typical fine neuroanatomy of NE fibers. In fact, apart from the marked spreading of axonal projections due to a profuse collateralization (which is typical for neurons forming the iso-dendritic core of the RF), axon collaterals are gifted with varicosities, also named “boutons en passage.” This is key in the case of AMPHs, which promote massive NE release while impairing NE uptake. This allows NE to be released in the extracellular medium from each varicosity along the course of axon fibers to produce extra-synaptic, paracrine effects, even remotely from the release site via volume transmission. Altogether, these features synergize to produce widespread extra-synaptic effects following AMPHs-induced NE release in each brain area. This explains why AMPHs activate wide brain areas leading at the same time to different behavioral, motor and vegetative effects. These include the limbic system, the hypothalamus, the prefrontal cortex, as well as the whole brainstem, spinal cord and peripheral organs receiving NE sympathetic innervation.

(i)  the  ventral  NE  bundle  (VNB,  which  originates  from  the LC)  as  well  as;  (ii)  the  dorsal  NE  bundle  (DNB);  and  (iii) the  medial  forebrain  bundle  (MFB),  which  originate  from  a number  of  NE  nuclei  within  the  pons  and  medulla,  including LC,  PB,  Al  and  A2  (Dresse,  1966;  Stein  and  Wise,  1969; Crow  et  al.,  1972;  Wise  et  al.,  1973;  Ritter  and  Stein,  1974; Carlezon  and  Chartoff,  2007).  In  fact,  apart  from  LC,  caudal NE  nuclei  such  as  the  Al/Cl  and  A2/C2  cell  groups  project profusely  to  the  forebrain  and  hypothalamus  (Nieuwenhuys et  al.,  1982;  Mai  et  al.,  2008;  Berridge  et  al.,  2012).  As  shown by  retrograde  tracing  studies,  the  LC  provides  nearly  50%  of NE  input  to  the  forebrain  and  hypothalamus,  while  Al/Cl  and A2/C2  groups  contribute  from  25%  to  40%  (Espana  and Berridge,  2006).  This  partly  explains  why  AMPHs  promote arousal  (Berridge  et  al.,  1999;  Berridge  and  Stalnaker,  2002; Berridge,  2006).  AMPHs-induced  cortical  arousal via  NE  release from  these  nuclei  is  associated  with  drug-seeking  behavior and  relapse  (Espana  et  al.,  2016).  This  may  occur  also via  NE acting  on  hypothalamic  perifornical  orexin  neurons.  Orexins are  hypothalamic  neuropeptides  implicated  in  a  variety  of behaviors  including  sleep/wakefulness,  feeding  and  reward (Sakurai  et  al.,  1998;  Sakurai,  2007;  Sakurai  and  Mieda,  2011). Recent  studies  suggest  that  orexins  play  a  role  in  drug-induced sensitization  and  drug-seeking  motivation,  which  occurs through  a  fair  neuro-anatomical  specificity  (Sharf  et  al.,  2010; Mahler  et  al.,  2012).  The  effects  of  orexin-containing  nuclei  are

## grounded  on  their  strong  connection  with  reticular  NE  nuclei 

## **(Figure  4).** In  fact,  NE  nuclei  of  the  brainstem  represent  the most  densely  orexin-innervated  neuronal  population  (Date et  al.,  1999;  Nambu  et  al.,  1999;  Peyron  et  al.,  2000;  Marcus et  al.,  2001).  This  occurs  mostly  within  NE  LC  neurons,  where orexin  type  1  receptors  (OX1R)  are  densely  expressed  to promote  arousal  and  locomotor  activity  (Hagan  et  al.,  1999; Marcus  et  al.,  2001).  A  reciprocal  modulation  occurs  between LC-NE  and  hypothalamic  perifornical  orexin-containing neurons  (van  den  Pol  et  al.,  2002;  Bayer  et  al.,  2005;  Gompf and  Aston-Jones,  2008).  This  is  key  in  the  case  of  METH, which  increases  orexin  levels  in  METH  abusers  (Chen  et  al., 2016).  Likewise,  METH  administration  strongly  activates orexin-producing  neurons,  as  shown  by  the  increase  in  c-Fos expression  (Estabrooke  et  al.,  2001;  Cornish  et  al.,  2012).  A considerable  amount  of  orexin  receptors  is  present  also  in lower  reticular  NE  groups  including  Al/Cl  and  A2/C2  (Marcus et  al.,  2001),  which  explains  functional  studies  addressing the  role  of  such  a  connection  in  food  intake  and  AMPHsinduced  anorexia  (McCabe  and  Leibowitz,  1984;  Li  et  al., 2015;  Ritter,  2017).  Apart  from  providing  molecular  and anatomical  specificity,  NE  neurons  are  also  involved  in  genetic susceptibility  to  AMPHs-induced  behavioral  effects.  In  fact,  a genetic  polymorphism  affecting  the  limiting  enzyme  for  NE synthesis,  DA  beta-hydroxylase  (DBH),  is  involved  in  substance abuse disorders (Kalayasiri et al., 2014). Such a hypothesis

Orexin perifornical neurons are profusely connected with a number of brainstem RF nuclei including the PAG/dorsal raphe, VTA, Ch6, Ch5, A6, A5, A7, A1/C1, A2/C2 (Marcus et al., 2001; Sharf et al., 2010; Mahler et al., 2012). However, among these neuronal groups, orexins display the highest neuro-anatomical and pharmacological specificity with NE-containing neurons, as witnessed by the strong reciprocal connections with LC and A1/C1 nuclei (thick dashed connectors) and the abundance of orexin receptors in these nuclei (McCabe and Leibowitz, 1984; van den Pol et al., 2002; Bayer et al., 2005; Gompf and Aston-Jones, 2008; Li et al., 2015; Ritter, 2017). In the light of such connections with NE neurons, orexin-containing neurons are dragged in a variety of functions including, arousal, locomotion, feeding, reward, sensitization, motivation (Sakurai et al., 1998; Sakurai, 2007; Sakurai and Mieda, 2011). Since AMPHs are powerful NE releasers and they strongly activate orexin-producing neurons as well, it is likely that the strong connections between orexin and NE-neurons of the LC and Al/Cl are implicated in the effects induced by AMPHs.

was  tested  specifically  in  DBH  KO  mice,  where  AMPH  was much  more  effective  in  producing  DA-release  and  behavioral sensitization  (Weinshenker  et  al.,  2008).  It  is  remarkable  that such  a  potentiation  of  DA-release  and  behavioral  sensitization is  reminiscent  of  what  occurs  in  LC-damaged  mice  following METH administration.

## **Molecular  Mechanisms  Bridging  Reticular** **NE  Nuclei  to  AMPHs-lnduced  Behavioral** **Effects**

# This  paragraph  adds  on  the  well  established  evidence  that AMPHs-induced  DA  release  is  key  to  produce  locomotor stimulation,  sensitization  and  neurotoxicity  to  encompass  the synergistic  role  of  NE  reticular  nuclei  in  sustaining  these  effects. In  fact,  the  powerful  NE  release  contributes  to  AMPHs-induced hyper-locomotion  and  stereotypies.  Stereotypies,  which  occur upon  reiterated  AMPHs  administration  increase  progressively following  the  same  dose  of  AMPHs  as  a  typical  expression of  AMPHs-induced  behavioral  sensitization.  This  is  achieved by  multiple  mechanisms,  which  include  the  stimulation  of alpha  1-adrenergic  receptors  (al-ARs),  as  demonstrated  since

## the  early  ‘80s  (Dickinson  et  al.,  1988;  Drouin  et  al.,  2002a,b; Vanderschuren  et  al.,  2003).  Consistently,  reduced  hyper­ locomotion  and  a  loss  of  sensitization  occur  after  alB-AR inhibition  or  in  mice  genetically  lacking  this  receptor  subtype 

## (Auclair  et  al.,  2002,  2004).  Consistently  we  found  that  alBAR-KO  mice  are  also  protected  from  METH-induced  toxicity 

## (Battaglia  et  al.,  2003).  This  confirms  data  from  Zuscik  et  al. 

## (2000)  who  showed  that  overexpression  of  alB-ARs  in  mice leads  to  an  extended  degeneration,  which  appears  reminiscent of  METH-induced  neuronal  damage  (Fornai  et  al.,  2004)  and multiple  system  atrophy  (Zuscik  et  al.,  2000).  These  mice  also develop spontaneous seizures, which are a typical effect observed upon  METH-induced  sensitization.  Remarkably,  when  we  used alB-AR-KO  mice,  seizures  were  prevented  (Pizzanelli  et  al., 2009).  Again,  activation  of  alB  ARs  accounts  for  the  increase  in burst  firing  of  midbrain  DA  neurons  induced  by  AMPHs  (Pan et  al.,  1996;  Paladini  et  al.,  2001),  while  alB  ARs  antagonists suppress  DA-related  behaviors  stimulated  by  AMPHs  (Poncelet et al.,  1983; Snoddy  and Tessel,  1985; Tessel  and Barrett,  1986; Dickinson  et  al.,  1988;  Mavridis  et  al.,  1991;  Blanc  et  al.,  1994). Thus,  alB-ARs  play  a  strong  role  in  the  deleterious  effects induced  by  METH  in  the  brain.  In  contrast,  the per ipheral ef fects

induced  by  METH  on  NE  neurons  appear  to  rely  on  alA-ARs since  no  effects  are  determined  by  alB-ARs  (Kikuchi-Utsumi et al., 2013). Consistently,  the  selective  inhibition  of  al-AR  within  the nucleus  accumbens  (NAc)  or  prefrontal  cortex  abolishes  hyper­ locomotion  induced  by  AMPHs  (Blanc  et  al.,  1994;  Darracq et  al.,  1998).  Again,  amplification  of  AMPHs-induced  locomotor activity  occurs  by  increasing  extracellular  levels  of  NE via NET  inhibition  or  by  enhancing  NE  release via  blockade  of inhibitory  pre-synaptic  a2-ARs  (Dickinson  et  al.,  1988;  Xu et  al.,  2000;  Juhila  et  al.,  2005).  Data  concerning  the  effects  of the  pharmacological  modulation  of  NE  receptors  on  AMPHsinduced  behavior  are  mostly  related  to  NE  released  from LC  neurons.  Thus,  LC-NE  activity  appears  to  be  crucial  for sensitizing  AMPHs-induced  behavior  and  toxicity,  although other  nuclei  need  to  be  investigated  more  extensively.  For instance,  catecholamine  neurons  of  the  AP  are  relevant,  since  a damage to  this area  increases locomotor  activity while  facilitating stereotypies  (Costall  et  al.,  1981).  In  addition,  Al/Cl  and, to  a  lesser  extent,  A2/C2  neurons,  which  are  connected  with orexin-containing  perifornical  neurons  of  the  hypothalamus **(Figure  4),** modulate  food  intake  and  contribute  to  anorexia induced  by  AMPHs  (McCabe  and  Leibowitz,  1984;  Li  et  al., 2015;  Ritter,  2017).  The  A5  nucleus  sends  descending  axons to  the  spinal  cord  down  to  the  lumbosacral  tract  (Westlund et  al.,  1981).  A5-  together  with  A7-neurons  are  involved  in anti-nociceptive  effects,  and  they  are  likely  to  mediate  AMPHsdependent  analgesia  (Proudfit,  1988;  Miller  and  Proudfit,  1990). AMPHs  also  target  the  PB,  a  critical  integrative  site  within  the brainstem being  involved in p ain, satiety,  taste, arousal, breathing and  blood  pressure  (Hajnal  et  al.,  2009;  Martelli  et  al.,  2013; Davern,  2014).  The  involvement  of  PB  nucleus  was  investigated independently  of  NE  release  only  in  the  context  of  conditioned taste  aversion  induced  by  AMPHs  (Krivanek,  1997).  In  fact, within  PB,  AMPHs  increase  protein  kinase  C  (PKC)  activity, placed  downstream  to  METH-induced  signaling  and  toxicity (Lin et al., 2012). **The Brainstem NE Nuclei and** **AMPHs-induced Autonomic Effects** Al/Cl  neurons  are  anatomically  organized  in  a  roughly viscerotopic  manner,  in  order  to  allow  specific  subsets  of cells  to  control  different  visceral  functions,  encompassing circulation,  breathing,  glycemia,  inflammation  (Guyenet  et  al., 2013).  Al/Cl  neurons  are  mostly  involved  in  regulating  blood pressure  (Reis  et  al.,  1984).  In  fact,  apart  from  activating pre-ganglionic  vasomotor  neurons,  Al/Cl  neurons  control vasopressin  release  and  sodium/water  balance  (Blessing  and Willoughby,  1985;  Guyenet,  2006).  Thus,  due  to  a  powerful NE-release  by  AMPHs,  it  is  expected  that  all  regions  being innervated  by  the  Al/Cl  complex  will  be  activated  during AMPHs  administration.  This  may  explain  why  AMPHs  induce  a severe  increase  in  blood  pressure  (Liu  and V arner, 199 6),  which was once  believed to  be solely  due to  peripheral NE.  Thus, quite selective  effects  of  AMPHs  on  a  discrete  neuron  number  of the  medulla  are  supposed  to  provide  a  generalized  increase  in blood pressure **(Figure 5).** This key  catecholamine nucleus  adds

## on  and  surpasses  the  whole  peripheral  NE  system  in  mediating AMPHs-induced  hypertension.  Thus,  hypertension  produced by  AMPHs  largely  depends  on  a  few  central  neurons,  which regulate  the  vascular  tone.  Similarly  to  behavioral  effects,  the visceral  responses  to  AMPHs  are  characterized  by  sensitization. Remarkably,  even  a  single  dose  of  METH  may  induce  a sensitized  response  in  blood  pressure,  which  is  accompanied  by increased  c-Fos  immunoreactivity  within  TH-positive  neurons of  Al/Cl  area  and  LC  (Marchese  et  al.,  2017).  These  findings confirm  an  overlap  between  behavioral  and  vegetative  effects induced  by  AMPHs.  In  sharp  contrast  with  a  severe  increase in  blood  pressure,  chronic  METH  may  lead  to  sudden  and severe  hypotension  with  bradycardia,  which  may  lead  to  a  lethal cardiovascular  collapse  (Chan  et  al.,  1994;  Ago  et  al.,  2006; Miyashita  et  al.,  2007).  This  is  also  related  to  a  direct  effect of  METH  within  Al/Cl  area,  which  mediates  METH-induced increase  in  heart  rate  and  arterial  pressure  (Liu  and  Varner, 

## 1996), while  at high  and/or reiterated  doses, METH  may produce a  selective  neuronal  death  of  Al/Cl  (Li  et  al.,  2012).  This neuronal loss  abolishes the  descending activation  of sympathetic pre-ganglionic  neurons  (SPNs),  which  are  no  longer  able  to stimulate  the  heart  and  produce  contraction  of  smooth  muscle within  the  blood  vessels.  This  causes  a  sudden  fall  in  blood pressure  leading  to  METH-induced  cardiovascular  collapse  (Li et  al.,  2012).  These  data  are  relevant  to  understand  the  key role  of  the  reticular  nuclei  in  regulating  blood  pressure  while disclosing  a  previously  overlooked  neurotoxicity  of  METH  on central  NE  neurons.  In  fact,  these  data  demonstrate  that  NE neurons,  apart  from  modulating  METH  toxicity  to  DA  cells 

## (Fornai  et  al.,  1995,  1996a,b,  1997,  1998,  1999;  Weinshenker et  al.,  2008),  may  also  represent  a  primary  target  of  METH toxicity.  In  fact,  the  Al/Cl  nuclei  innervate  the  SNPs  being the  pivot  to  provide  direct  excitatory  input  to  the  thoraco­ lumbar sympathetic column  of the cord  (Ross et al.,  1984). These neurons  represent  a  critical  link  between  the  central  respiratory rhythm  generator  and  the  vasomotor  outflow  (Guyenet  et  al., 

## 1990).  A  multi-faceted  signaling  mechanism  between  Al/Cl  cell groups  and  SPNs  in  the  spinal  cord  is  witnessed  by  several neuropeptides  (such  as  prolactin,  substance  P,  and  cocaineand  amphetamine-regulated  transcript.  Cart,  peptide),  which  are co-released  within  target  areas  (Chen  et  al.,  1999;  Dun  et  al., 2002).  It  is  remarkable  that  METH  persistently  increases  the expression  of  Cart  peptide via  epigenetic  mechanisms  (Jayanthi et  al.,  2017),  which  suggest  that  in  addition  to  NE  itself, neuropeptides  produced  by  reticular  NE  neurons  play  a  role  in AMPHs-induced  autonomic  alterations.  This  is  not  surprising since  NE  nuclei  are  widely  involved  in  neural  circuitries,  which regulate  both  behavioral  and  autonomic  effects  induced  by AMPHs.  For  instance,  Al/Cl  sends  visceral  information  to LC  (Aston-Jones  et  al.,  1986,  1991;  Guyenet,  1991),  which  in turn,  projects  to  midbrain  DA  neurons  (Kirouac  and  Ciriello, 

## 1997;  Mejfas-Aponte  et  al.,  2009).  In  this  way,  DA  neurons are  recruited  by  these  neurons,  which  mediate  visceral  effects produced  by  AMPHs.  Such  an  integrated  scenario  indicates that  behavioral  and  vegetative  effects  produced  by  AMPHs, despite  being  primarily  processed  within  different  nuclei,  then converge in a common circuitry, which encompasses most

**FIGURE 5 |** A1/C1 neurons as a key center to control blood pressure. Hypertension produced by AMPHs largely depends on Al/Cl medullary neurons, which regulate the vascular tone, heart rate and blood pressure. NE released from A1/C1 neurons regulates blood pressure by directly activating sympathetic pre-ganglionic neurons (SPNs), which in turn stimulate the heart and produce contraction of smooth muscle within blood vessels. Due to a powerful NE-release by AMPHs, these peripheral targets innervated by the Al /Cl complex are strongly activated during AMPHs administration (Liu and Varner, 1996). This response occurs in a sensitized manner following repeated dosing of AMPHs (Marchese et al., 2017).

catecholamine  containing  nuclei  of  the  brainstem  RF.  In  this way,  depending  on  which  nucleus  we  focus  on,  different effects  produced  by  AMPHs  can  be  mechanistically  explained by  the  specific  neuro-anatomical  connections  of  this  very same  nucleus.  This  is  not  surprising  at  all  when  considering the  simultaneous  activation  of  the  peripheral  NE  sympathetic nervous  system  when  a  demanding  environmental  task  is activating  the  NE  ascending  reticular  nuclei  to  produce  arousal or during rewarding stimuli.

## **THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN NE AND DA IN** **AMPHs-INDUCED BEHAVIOR** Within  a  context  of  NE-dependent  reward,  a  balanced  dual 

# perspective  indicates  that  AMPHs  need  to  converge  on  both  DA and  NE  cells  in  order  to  be  fully  effective  in  producing  reward. This was already  hypothesized in a  pioneer manuscript by  Fibiger and  Phillips  (1974).  In  fact,  caudal  nuclei  of  the  RF  strongly connects  with  midbrain  reticular  DA  nuclei.  This  circuitry originated  during  phylogeny,  as  biochemical,  anatomical  and

## physiological  features  strongly  witness  for  an  evolutionary continuum between  mesencephalic DA  neurons and  more caudal NE cell  groups (Bucci et  al., 2017). In  fact, profuse and  reciprocal connections  establish  between  NE/E  nuclei  within  the  pons  and medulla  and  midbrain  DA  nuclei  (Simon  et  al.,  1979;  Deutch et al.,  1986; Grenhoff  and Svensson,  1993; Grenhoff  et al.,  1993; Liprando  et  al.,  2004;  Mejias-Aponte  et  al.,  2009).  For  instance, DA  neurons  of  the  Retrorubral  Field  (RRF,  A8)  and  VTA  (A10) receive  abundant  NE  innervation,  which  is  provided  mainly  from the  nuclei  Al,  A2,  A5  and  A6  (Mejias-Aponte  et  al.,  2009).  Thus, DA  and  NE  systems  do  not  represent  separate  compartments within  the  CNS  but  rather  an  interconnected  system,  which share  key  neurobiological  features  making  it  as  the  endogenous circuitry  where  AMPHs  electively  impinge  to  produce  a  number of  systemic  effects.  The  strong  anatomical  connections  between NE  and  DA  systems  are  conserved  at  molecular  level.  This  is best  represented  by  the  phylogeny  of  NET  and  DAT,  which indeed represent  the evolutionary  divergence of  an archaic  single catecholamine  transporter  (meNET),  which  was  isolated  and characterized already in the brain of the teleost fish medaka

**FIGURE 6 |** Structural similarities between NET and DAT confound neuron-specific NE and DA compartmentalization. Both NET and DAT represent the evolutionary divergence of a single catecholamine transporter (meNET), which was isolated and characterized already in the brain of the teleost fish medaka (Roubert et al., 2001). In the light of a strong structural similarity, both NET and DAT take up extracellular DA with a similar potency **(A).** In fact, in the presence of an excess of extracellular DA (due to either a selective blockade of DAT or a reverted direction of DA transport), this may compete effectively with NE, thus being inappropriately stored within NE terminals. This explains why NE axons may internalize DA in the absence of DAT (Rocha et al., 1998). This same phenomenon also explains why in some instances selective NET inhibitors may paradoxically increase extracellular DA (B). In fact, when a powerful NE release occurs in a densely DA-innervated area, it is very likely that extracellular NE is taken up mostly by fraudulent DA axons instead of authentic NE terminals.

(Roubert  et  al.,  2001).  This  ancestral  carrier  is  very  similar  to both  the  human  NET  and  DAT,  showing  70%  and  64%  amino acid  homology,  respectively.  In  fact,  NET  responds  to  AMPHs similarly  to  DAT  and  it  represents  the  main  gateway  for  AMPHs to  invade  NE  terminals  and  to  reach  specific  sub-cellular  and molecular  targets  (Seidel  et  al.,  2005).  For  instance,  following AMPHs  administration  there  is  a  down-regulation  of  NET  and DAT,  which  are  both  stored  in  endosomes  (Annamalai  et  al., 2010;  Hong  and  Amara,  2013).  Following  AMPHs  both  DAT and  NET,  which  remain  on  the  plasma  membrane,  revert  their transport  of  catecholamine  (Sulzer  et  al.,  1993;  Robertson  et  al., 2009).  Moreover,  both  transporters  tend  to  be  internalized  within the  terminals  once  bound  to  AMPHs.  As  mentioned  above  there is  a  strong  similarity  between  NET  and  DAT.  In  fact,  they  are able to  take up  extracellular DA  with a  similar potency  (Rothman et  al.,  2001).  This  affinity  may  confound  the  neuron-specific compartmentalization **(Figure  6).** In  the  presence  of  an  excess 

Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | ======www.frontiersin==.org====**10**====May 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 48

## of  extracellular  DA,  this  may  compete  effectively  with  NE,  thus being  inappropriately  stored  within  NE  terminals  (Amara  and Kuhar,  1993;  Ramamoorthy  et  al.,  2011;  Borgkvist  et  al.,  2012). This  explains  why  in  some  instances  selective  NET  inhibitors may  paradoxically  increase  extracellular  DA  (Reith  et  al.,  1997), while  NE  axons  may  internalize  DA  in  the  absence  of  DAT 

## (Rocha et al., 1998). Again, when a powerful NE release occurs in a  densely  DA-innervated  area,  it  is  very  likely  that  extracellular NE  is  taken  up  mostly  by  fraudulent  DA  axons  instead  of authentic  NE  terminals **(Figure  6).** This  needs  to  be  taken  into account  when  considering  the  effects  of  AMPHs,  since  the  fine structure  of  a  given  brain  region  may  switch  considerably  the ratio  of  a  combined  mechanism  of  action  upon  both  DA  and NE  systems.  This  fully  applies  to  the  different  brain  areas  which sustain  the  reinforcing  and  rewarding  effects  of  AMPHs  (the richly  DA-innervated  NAc  compared  with  densely  NE-enriched allo-cortical regions).

**THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF** **BRAINSTEM DA-NE INTERPLAY IN THE** **BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS INDUCED** **BY AMPHs** NE sourced  by the  reticular nuclei  of the  low brainstem  is key  for 

# AMPHs-induced  behavior  (Rothman  et  al.,  2001;  Weinshenker and  Schroeder,  2007;  Weinshenker  et  al.,  2008).  This  occurs also via  amplification  of  DA-related  rewarding  and  reinforcing properties.  This  is  not  surprising  given  the  profuse  reciprocal connections  between  NE  and  DA  nuclei.  In  particular,  LC innervates  almost  all  brain  areas,  which  receive  DA  innervation throughout  the  mesolimbic  and  mesocortical  systems,  including the  ventral  striatum  and  the  prefrontal  cortex  (Nicola  and Malenka,  1998).  In  fact,  NE  axons  from  LC  neurons  regulate DA  release  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  (Gresch  et  al.,  1995;  Devoto et al.,  2005), while  a damage  to LC  projections with  DSP-4 alters baseline  or  stimulated  DA  release  in  the  NAc  (Lategan  et  al., 1992).  This  is  consistent  with  studies  showing  that  depletion of  NE  in  the  prefrontal  cortex  potentiates  AMPHs-induced behavioral  sensitization  through  striatal  DA  release  (Ventura et  al.,  2003).  In  addition  to  alB  ARs  involvement  in  DA-related behaviors  and  toxicity  induced  by  AMPHs  (Poncelet  et al., 1983; Snoddy  and  Tessel,  1985;  Tessel  and  Barrett,  1986;  Dickinson et  al.,  1988;  Mavridis  et  al.,  1991;  Blanc  et  al.,  1994),  the  role of  [i-ARs  has  been  investigated  as  well.  In  fact,  Albers  and Sonsalla  (1955)  showed  that  a  |3-AR  blocker  prevents  AMPHsinduced  DA  toxicity,  and  a  subsequent  study  confirmed  these data  showing  that  |3-AR  blockers  prevent  AMPHs-induced  DA sensitization  (Colussi-Mas  et  al.,  2005).  These  data  confirm  that DA  neurotoxicity,  just  like  autonomic,  motor  and  behavioral effects  undergoes  sensitization.  This  is  expected  since  AMPHsinduced  sensitization  up-regulates  those  molecular  cascades, which  are  the  common  pathway  to  produce  all  AMPHsinduced alterations. Similarly,  marked  alterations  in  AMPHs-induced  DA  release within  the  dorsal  striatum  occur  following  a  damage  to  LC via DSP-4  and  following  either  genetic  or  pharmacological  blockade of NE synthesis (Weinshenker et al., 2008). Such a neurochemical effect  mediated  by  NE  loss  enhances  the  behavioral  response induced  by  METH  while  potentiating  nigrostriatal  METH toxicity  (Weinshenker  et  al.,  2000,2008).  In  addition,  a  reduction of  TH  within  LC  neurons (via  RNA  interference)  potentiates DI  receptor-dependent  AMPHs-induced  sensitization  in  the ventral  striatum,  to  an  extent,  which  is  not  replicated  by  DAT inhibition (Smith  and Greene,  2012). In  line with  this, Harro  et al. (2000)  found  that  a  loss  of  NE  axons  increases  AMPHs-induced locomotor  activity  while  up-regulating  striatal  D2  receptors. Again,  a  damage  to  LC  neurons  enhances  nigrostriatal  METH toxicity  in  both  mice  and  rats  (Fornai  et  al.,  1995,  1996a,b),  an effect,  which  is  related  to  increased  DA  sensitivity  to  METH rather  than  to  METH  pharmacokinetics  (Fornai  et  al.,  1997, 1998,1999). Such  a potentiation  is suddenly evident  by observing METH-induced  behavioral  changes  when  dramatic  stereotypies occur  in  LC-damaged  mice.  It  is  likely  that  NE oper ates at som e level  within  DA  neurons  to  alter  synaptic  plasticity.  In  fact,  the

## abnormal  synaptic  plasticity,  which  happens  following  pulsatile DA  stimulation  in  a  parkinsonian  striatum,  is  worsened  in LC-damaged  mice,  which  develop  severe  abnormal  involuntary movements following  low doses  of L-DOPA  (Fulceri et  al., 2007). These effects appear  to rely more  on LC compared  with other NE nuclei.  In  fact,  they  can  be  reproduced  by  a bi lateral  stereotactic injection  of  the  neurotoxin  6-OHDA  within  both  LC  nuclei

# uncovered  a  highly  heterogeneous  nature  of  the  dorsal  raphe neurons,  thus  providing  a  seminal  contribution  in  implementing the  original  description  by  Dahlstrom  and  Fuxe  (1964). Such  a  heterogeneity  holds  true  for  either  cyto-architectural, neurochemical  or  topographic  differences  characterizing  subsets of  neuronal  populations  within  the  dorsal  raphe.  In  detail,  the dorsal  raphe  nucleus  (B8-B9),  which  extends  from  the  rostral pons  up  to  the  midbrain  within  and  around  the  ventromedial and  ventrolateral  PAG,  can  be  subdivided  into  five  sub-regions, namely  caudal,  dorsal,  ventral,  ventrolateral  and  interfascicular 

## (Steinbusch et  al., 1981;  Baker et  al., 1990,  1991). In  the present paragraph,  we  focus  on  the  ventromedial and vent rolateral P AG, where  a  number  of  catecholamine  nuclei,  targeted  by  AMPHs, are  placed.  This  is  the  case  of  the  NE  nucleus  epicoeruleus, DA  neurons  of  the  AlOdc  nucleus,  as  well  as  cholinergic neurons  of  the  laterodorsal  tegmental  nucleus  (LDTg,  Ch6), which  intermingle  in  the  ventral  and  ventrolateral  PAG  with their  rostral  extent  (Hokfelt  et  al.,  1984;  Mai  and  Paxinos,  2012; Vasudeva and Waterhouse, 2014; **Figure** 7). **AMPHs and Catecholamine Neurons of** **the PAG** Despite  being  poorly  investigated  in  the  specific  case  of  AMPHs compared  with  low  brainstem  reticular  nuclei,  catecholamine neurons  of  the  PAG  represent  an  important  neuro-anatomical substrate  for  the  behavioral  changes  induced  by  AMPHs 

## (Tasman  and  Simon,  1983;  Sobieraj  et  al.,  2016).  This  is  not surprising  given  the  plethora  of  functions,  which  are  regulated by  the  PAG,  such  as  pain,  anxiety,  arousal  and  escape,  as  well as  heart  rate,  thermogenesis,  mean  arterial  blood  pressure  and breathing  (Bandler  et  al.,  1985;  Bandler  and  Carrive,  1988; Brandao  et  al.,  1990;  Carrive,  1991;  Lovick,  1993;  Coimbra  and Brandao, 1997;  Hayward et  al., 2003).  In addition,  catecholamine PAG  neurons  are  profusely  connected  with  a  variety  of  cortical and  subcortical  brain  regions.  These  include,  for  instance,  the thalamus,  the  medial  prefrontal  cortex,  the  basal  forebrain cholinergic  neurons,  the  hypothalamic  orexin  cells,  the  pontine LDTg,  most  of  the  NE  bulbo-pontine  nuclei,  and  the  VTA  (Li et  al.,  1990;  Reichling  and  Basbaum,  1991;  Bajic  et  al.,  2001, 2012; Lu et al., 2006; Rathner  and Morrison, 2006). Such a region becomes  the  prototype  for  confounding  outcomes  when  trying to  decipher  the  specific  effects  produced  by  each  monoamine­ containing nucleus in AMPHs-induced behavior, which appear

**FIGURE  7  |** Catecholamine  and  cholinergic  nuclei  of  the  dorsal  raphe/PAG.  The  dorsal  raphe  nucleus  extends  from  the  rostral  pons  up  to  the  midbrain  within  and around  the  ventromedial  and  ventrolateral  PAG.  In  fact,  at  this  level,  three  sub-regions  of  the  dorsal  raphe  intermingling  with  PAG  are  identified,  namely,  dorsal  (DRD), ventral  (DRV)  and  lateral  (DRL;  Steinbusch  et  al.,  1981;  Baker  et  al.,  1990,1991).  While  5-HT  neurons  are  scattered  throughout  all  the  dorsal  raphe,  the  ventromedial and  mostly  the  ventrolateral  PAG  (VLPAG)  hosts  a  mixed  neuronal  population,  among  which  catecholamine  and  cholinergic  neurons  prevail  at  large.  This  is  the  case of  the  NE  nucleus  epicoeruleus  corresponding  to  the  rostral  and  dorsal  extent  of  the  LC  complex.  Similarly,  DA  neurons  of  the  Al  Ode  nucleus,  as  well  as  cholinergic neurons of the Ch6 (LDTg) intermingle in the DRLA/LPAG with their rostral extent.

largely  related  to  the  profuse  isodendritic  connections  occurring within  the  PAG.  For  instance,  the  stimulation  of  dorsal  raphe nucleus,  besides  enhancing  extracellular  5-HT  levels  in  both  the forebrain  and  the  LC,  also  increases  extracellular  NE  (HajosKorcsok  and  Sharp,  2002).  Such  a  response  is  not  altered  by  a damage  to  5-HT  neurons  of  the  dorsal  raphe.  The  plethora  of connections  linking  PAG-dorsal  raphe  neurons  with  lower  NE brainstem  nuclei  appears  critical  in  AMPHs-induced  behavior. In  fact,  profuse  and  reciprocal  connections  occur  between  PAG and  reticular  NE  nuclei  targeted  by  AMPHs,  including  LC,  A5, A7,  PB,  and  Al/Cl  group.  For  instance,  the  LC  provides  a major  stimulatory  drive  to  the  dorsal  raphe  nucleus  while  the Al/Cl  provides  an  inhibitory  tone  (Peyron  et  al.,  1996;  Kim et  al.,  2004;  Cao  et  al.,  2010).  In  the  light  of  these  projections, the  PAG  becomes  an  interface  in  behavioral  control  concerning the  regulation  of  sleep-wake  cycle  and  arousal,  pain  modulation and cardiovascular responses (Benarroch, 2012).  NE connections with  DA-containing  nuclei  of  the  PAG  are  important  as  well. In  fact,  following  stimulation  of  LC,  al-AR-dependent  NE transmission  in  the  PAG  promotes  arousal via  modulation  of PAG  DA  neurons  activity  (Porter-Stransky  et  al.,  2019).  It  is remarkable  that  besides  the  SNpc,  METH  targets  DA  neurons of  the  PAG,  as  shown  in  autopsy  brains  from  METH  abusers (Quan  et  al.,  2005).  Beyond  neurotoxicity,  reiterated  METH administration  induces  plastic  effects  in  PAG  DA  neurons,  which associate  with  drug-induced  reward  and  addiction  (Sobieraj et  al.,  2016).  An  excitatory  effect  of  TH-positive  PAG  neurons on  the  adjacent  VTA  DA  cells  (Lu  et  al.,  2006)  is  likely  to participate  to  AMPHs-induced  activation  of  opioid  receptors

## **in AMPHs-induced Behavior**

# A  few  studies  demonstrated  that  beyond  monoamines, acetylcholine  (ACh)  is  involved  in  the  behavioral  effects of  AMPHs.  In  line  with  this,  METH  releases  ACh  in adult  mice  (Dobbs  and  Mark,  2008)  and  alters  striatal choline  acetyltransferase  (ChAT),  the  enzyme  responsible for  synthesizing  ACh,  in  humans  (Kish  et  al., 1999;  Siegal  et  al., 2004).  Given  the  critical  role  of  ACh  systems  in  cognition  (van Hest  et  al.,  1990;  Muir  et  al.,  1994;  Lin  et  al.,  1998;  Mirza  and Stolerman,  2000),  alterations  in  ACh  levels  and  receptors  are suggested  to  contribute  to  the  cognitive  impairments  observed following  METH  exposure.  Only  a  few  studies  investigated the  role  of  ACh  produced  specifically  by  reticular  brainstem nuclei  in  AMPH’s-induced  effects.  The  main  source  of  ACh  in the  brainstem  RF  is  represented  by  two  ACh  pontine  nuclei, which  correspond  to  the  peduncolopontine  nucleus  (PPN)  or peduncolopontine  tegmentum  (PPTg)  and  the  laterodorsal tegmental  nucleus  (LDTg).  These  nuclei  are  also  referred  to as  Ch5  and  Ch6,  respectively.  Rostrally,  the  Ch5  is  included between  two  DA  nuclei  of  the  RF:  ventrally,  it  contacts  the dorsomedial  aspect  of  the  A9,  while  dorsally  it  is  bordered by  the  A8.  Caudally,  the  Ch5  adjoins  the  LC.  Ch5  neuronal population  is  heterogeneous  regarding  its  spatial  distribution and neurochemistry. In fact, the dorsolateral portion of

Ferrucci et al.Amphetamines and Brainstem Reticular Nuclei

Ch5,  which  is  called  pars  compacta,  contains  densely  packed cholinergic  neurons  forming  a  continuum  with  Ch6  cholinergic neurons.  Ch6  neurons  contour  the  Ch5  nucleus  and  rostrally they  extend  into  the  PAG  and  medial  longitudinal  fasciculus. Caudally  to  the  Ch5  nucleus,  Ch6  neurons  are  intermingled  with NE  neurons  belonging  to  the  epicoeruleus  nucleus  (Mesulam et  al.,  1989).  Ch6  neurons  are  slightly  smaller  than  those  of Ch5 pars compacta.  As components of  the RF, Ch5  Ch6 neurons share  the  typical  isodendritic  conformation.  It  is  well-established that  Ch5  and  Ch6  neurons  are  targeted  by  the  basal  ganglia efferent  fibers.  Projections  from  these  neurons  are  directed  to the  thalamus  and  other  nuclei  of  the  brainstem  RF  (Mesulam et  al.,  1989).  Remarkably,  excitatory  cholinergic  fibers  have been  described,  which  project  mainly  from  these  two  nuclei to  the  VTA,  promoting  burst  firing  in  DA  neurons  and  thus enhancing  DA  release,  which  is  pivotal  for  AMPHs-induced behavior  (Woolf,  1991;  Yeomans  and  Baptista,  1997;  Yeomans et al.,  2001; Omelchenko  and Sesack,  2005, 2006).  In particular, Ch6  targets  VTA  DA  neurons,  while  Ch5  preferentially  targets SNpc  DA  neurons  (Oakman  et  al.,  1995).  Recent  studies suggest  that  ACh  in  addition  to  DA  is  primarily  involved  in the  initiation  and  maintenance  of  hyper-locomotion  induced by  METH.  In  detail,  Dobbs  and  Mark  (2008)  demonstrated that,  systemic  but  not  intra-VTA  perfusions  of  METH  in  mice induce  a  prolonged  ACh  release  within  VTA.  In  particular, extracellular  ACh  levels  persist  above  baseline  levels  for  2-3  h post-injection  and  it  takes  180  and  300  min  post-injection  to return  to  baseline  values,  after  a  low  and  high  dose  of  METH respectively.  Remarkably,  ACh  but  not  DA  release,  within  VTA, correlates  dose-dependently  with  METH-induced  locomotor activity. These data  suggest that METH  acts in the  VTA to induce a  robust,  though  short-lived,  increase  in  extracellular  DA  release while  producing  a  prolonged  increase  in  ACh  release,  which correlates  with  hyper-locomotion.  In  the  light  of  these  findings, the  same  authors  investigated  the  contribution  of  Ch6  and Ch5  nuclei  in  METH-induced  locomotor  activity.  Inhibition  of ACh  release  by  intra-Ch6  infusion  with  a  muscarinic  receptor agonist,  which  binds  to  M2  inhibitory  auto-receptors,  attenuates METH-induced  locomotor  activity  (Dobbs  and  Mark,  2012). As  assessed  by  brain  dialysis,  the  inhibition  of  Ch6  neuronal activity  blunts  METH-induced  increase  in  ACh  release  within the  VTA  dose-dependently,  while  it  has  no  effect  on  DA  release within the NAc.

## Ch6  ACh  neurons  are  not  involved  in  METH-induced drug-seeking  behavior  (Dobbs  and  Cunningham,  2014),  but  are important  for  METH-induced  locomotor  activity  (Dobbs  and Mark,  2012).  On  the  other  hand,  inhibition  of  ACh  release  from Ch5  does  not  produce  any  effects  either  on  ACh  or  DA  release within  VTA  and  NAc,  respectively.  Therefore,  it  is  likely  that Ch6,  rather  than  Ch5,  is  involved  in  locomotor  behavior  induced by  systemic  METH,  which  is  mediated  by  ACh  release  in  the VTA.  Previous  studies  suggest  that  a  damage  to  both  Ch5  and Ch6  blunts  hyper-locomotion  but  enhances  stereotypies  induced by  systemic  or  intra-ventrolateral  striatal  injections  of  AMPHs 

## (Inglis  et  al.,  1994;  Allen  and  Winn,  1995;  Forster  et  al.,  2002; Miller  et  al.,  2002).  This  is  due  to  an  increase  in  DA  outflow specifically  in  the  dorsal b ut  not  ventral  striatum, w hich  suggests 

Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | ======www.frontiersin==.org====**13**====May 2019 | Volume 13 | Article 48

## that  AMPHs-induced  hyper-locomotion  and  stereotypies  largely 

## depend  on  the  specific  effects  of  Ch5  and/or  Ch6  upon  the 

## mesostriatal  or  mesoaccumbens  DA  systems.  These  findings 

## warrant  further  studies  elucidating  the  site-specificity  for  ACh  in 

## mediating METH-induced behavioral alterations.

## Although  molecular  targets  responsible  for  AMPHs-induced 

## monoamine  release  are  well  known,  the  molecular  mechanisms 

## through  which  AMPHs  release  ACh  are  not  fully  established 

## yet.  A  stream  of  interpretation  indicates  a  close  functional 

## relationship  between  DA  system  and  ACh  release.  This 

## stems  from  evidence  showing  that  administration  of  DI  and 

## D2  receptor  antagonists  blunts  AMPHs-induced  ACh  release 

## within  the  striatum,  hippocampus  and  frontal  cortex  (Ajima 

## et  al.,  1990;  Damsma  et  al.,  1990,  1991;  Imperato  et  al., 

## 1993;  DeBoer  and  Abercrombie,  1996;  Keys  and  Mark,  1998). 

## Nonetheless,  contradictory  results  are  obtained  when  a  damage 

## to  the  nigrostriatal  DA  system  is  induced  by  6-OHDA.  In 

## fact,  6-OHDA  injections  produce  only  a  slight  decrease  in 

## extracellular  ACh  levels  induced  by  systemic  AMPHs  (Mandel 

## et al., 1994; Taguchi et al., 1998). These results led to hypothesize 

## that  AMPHs-induced  ACh  release  may  be  due  to  connections 

## between  cholinergic  and  catecholamine,  rather  than  solely  DA 

## systems.  This  is  supported  by  evidence  indicating that  combined 

## administration  of  the  TH  inhibitor  oi-methyl-p-tyrosine  with  the 

## VMAT  inhibitor  reserpine,  completely  blocks  AMPHs-induced 

## ACh  release  both in  vivo  and  in  striatal  slices  (Cantrill  et  al., 

## 1983;  Taguchi  et  al.,  1998).  In  any  case,  once  released  by 

## AMPHs,  ACh  provides  an  important  excitatory  input  to  those 

## neurons  expressing  nicotinic  ACh  receptors  (nACh-Rs).  This 

## was  mainly  investigated  on  DA  neurons,  where  activation  of 

## nACh-Rs  leads  to  intracellular  Ca2+  accumulation,  which  in  turn 

## facilitates  DA  exocytosis  (MacDermott  et  al.,  1999;  Engelman 

## and  MacDermott,  2004;  Lester  et  al.,  2010).  In  this  way,  AMPHs 

## produce  DA-related  effects  also via  ACh  release  (Drew  et  al., 

## 2000;  Camarasa  et  al.,  2008;  Chipana  et  al.,  2008;  Hondebrink 

## et  al.,  2012).  Recently,  nACh-Rs-mediated  Ca2+  increase  and 

## subsequent  nitric  oxide-synthase  activation  have  been  linked 

## to  AMPHs-induced  neurotoxicity  (Pubill  et  al.,  2011).  In 

## line  with  this,  the  pharmacological  blockade  of  a7  nACh-Rs 

## attenuates  METH-induced  oxidative  damage  and  nigrostriatal 

## neurotoxicity  both in  vivo  and  striatal  synaptosomes.  Studies 

## focusing  on  the  effects  of  AMPHs-induced  ACh  release  on  NE 

## system  are  missing  so  far,  which  warrants  additional  studies  to 

## test ACh-NE interplay following AMPHs.
