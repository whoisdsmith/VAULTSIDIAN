Amphetamine Increases Errors During Episodic Memory Retrieval Michael Edward Ballard, PhD, * David A. Gallo, PhD, t and Harriet de Wit, PhD* **Abstract:** Moderate doses of stimulant drugs arc known to enhance  memory encoding and consolidation, but their effects on memory re­ trieval have not been explored in depth. In laboratory animals, stimu­ lants seem to improve retrieval of emotional memories, but comparable studies have not been carried out in humans. In the present study, we examined the effects of dextroamphetamine (AMP) on retrieval of emotional and unemotional stimuli in healthy young adults, using doses that enhanced memory formation when administered before encoding in our previous study. During 3 sessions, healthy volunteers (n = 31) received 2 doses of AMP (10 and 20 mg) and placebo in counter­ balanced order under double-blind conditions. During each session, they first viewed emotional and unemotional pictures and words in a drugfree state, and then 2 days later their memory was tested, 1 hour after AMP or placebo administration. Dextroamphetamine did not affect the number of emotional or unemotional stimuli remembered, but both doses increased recall intrusions and false recognition. Dextroamphe­ tamine (20 mg) also increased the number of positively rated picture descriptions and words generated during free recall. These data provide the first evidence that therapeutic range doses of [[stimulant]] drugs can increase memory retrieval errors. The ability of AMP to positively bias recollection of prior events could contribute to its potential for abuse. **Key Words:** memory, amphetamine, human, arousal, drug abuse

[[Stimulant]] drugs are widely used for their cognitive-enhancing properties, both in the treatment of cognitive deficits (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder),1 as well as by healthy individuals to boost cognitive performance.2 Research in both humans and laboratory animals supports the idea that [[stimulant]] drugs can improve performance on a variety of cognitive tasks (for reviews, see Smith and Farah,3 McGaugh and Roozendaal,4 and de Jongh et al5). Notably, however, this research has focused primarily on the processing of new information (eg, attention, working memory, and associative learning), rather than retrieval of previously learned information. Thus, relatively little is known about how stimulant drugs affect memory retrieval. A large literature indicates that moderate doses of stimulant drugs can enhance new memory formation. In humans, the

Prototypic [[stimulant]] drug dextroamphetamine (AMP) improves episodic memory when administered at the time of learning, and it also enhances other functions related to memory encoding processes, including attention, working memory, associative learning, 6 and cognitive flexibility. Interestingly, AMP also improves episodic memory when it is administered immediately after encoding, indicating that it also enhances memory consolidation. In rodents as well, AMP typically enhances both learning (encoding) and retention (consolidation) of conditioned behaviors.

Far fewer studies have examined the effects of [[stimulant]] drugs on memory retrieval, and the available data are mixed. In rodents, AMP enhances retrieval of both aversively motivated and appetitively motivated conditioned behaviors. However, in humans, AMP administered at retrieval testing did not improve memory for previously studied lists of neutral words. One reason for this apparent discrepancy may be that human studies assessed memory for lists of unemotional words, whereas the rodent studies assessed memory for emotionally arousing procedures. Indeed, in a recent study with humans, we found that AMP administered before encoding enhanced memory for emotionally arousing pictures more than for neutral pictures, raising the possibility that AMP may also selectively affect retrieval of emotional memories.

In addition to these memory-enhancing effects, AMP also increases arousal, and non-pharmacological manipulations that increase arousal (eg, stress) typically impair memory retrieval in both humans and nonhuman animals (for reviews, see Roozendaal and McGaugh28 and Wolf29). Moreover, in humans, experimentally increasing arousal state before retrieval testing impairs memory more strongly for previously studied emotional stimuli than unemotional stimuli. This suggests that AMP may preferentially impair emotional memory retrieval, just as it preferentially enhanced emotional memory formation (eg, similar to stress34). Thus, AMP may either enhance or impair retrieval of emotional memories. The present study investigated the acute effects of AMP on emotional and unemotional memory retrieval in healthy human volunteers. The design was similar to our previous study in which subjects viewed emotional pictures on 1 day and their recognition memory was tested 2 days later. However, in the previous study, they received AMP on the study day whereas in the current study, they received AMP (10 or 20 mg) or placebo only on the retrieval day. All participants received all 3 drug conditions, in counterbalanced order, under double-blind conditions. In addition to the picture recognition measure used in our previous study, this study also included more difficult memory tasks (ie, free recall and word stimuli). Finally, we also looked at confidence ratings as an indicator of the subjective strength of correct and incorrect memory responses.

#### **Design**

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

In this within-subject study, healthy volunteers received placebo, and 10- and 20-mg AMP under double-blind conditions, counterbalanced order. For each drug condition, they attended 2 laboratory visits—a 1-hour visit (encoding phase) where they viewed emotional (positively and negatively valanced) and unemotional (neutral valence) pictures and words under drug-free conditions, and a 4-hour visit (retrieval phase) 2 days later, where they ingested capsules containing placebo or AMP before completing memory tests. This study was approved by the University of Chicago Institutional Review Board.

#### **Procedure**

**Subjects**

Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 35 years (n = 31; 16 women) were recruited via posters, advertisements, and word-of-mouth referrals. Prospective participants underwent an in-person psychiatric interview and physician-supervised physical examination including an electrocardiogram, and they completed a health questionnaire with detailed information on current and lifetime drug use. Exclusion criteria included current Axis I Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition disorder including substance dependence (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) except tobacco dependence. Volunteers were excluded if they had a history of psychosis or mania, less than a high school education, lack of fluency in English, a body mass index outside 19 to 26 kg/m2, high blood pressure (>140/90), an abnormal electrocardiogram, reported daily use of any medication other than birth control, or were pregnant, lactating, or planning to become pregnant in the next 3 months. Women not taking hormonal contraceptives (n = 10 of 16) were tested during their follicular phase only because hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle can influence responses to the drug.

#### **Session Protocols**

Qualifying participants attended a 1-hour orientation session to become acquainted with the study procedures, provide informed consent, and practice study tasks and questionnaires. They were informed that the study was investigating the effects of drugs on mood and memory, and, to minimize drug-related expectancies, they were told that hey might receive a placebo, [[stimulant]], sedative/tranquilizer, or a marijuana-like drug. Participants were instructed to consume their normal amounts of caffeine and nicotine before sessions, but to abstain from using alcohol and over-the-counter, prescription, and illicit drugs for 24 hours before the sessions. They were informed that they would be tested for drug use before each session to verify abstinence. Participants were also advised to get their normal amounts of sleep, and not to eat solid food for 2 hours before the retrieval phase visits to allow for proper drug absorption.

Participants were tested individually in comfortably furnished rooms with a television and VCR, magazines, and a computer for administering questionnaires and tasks. They were allowed to watch television, neutral movies, or read when no measures were being obtained, but they were not allowed to sleep, work, or study, and they had no access to cell phones or Internet. 

Upon arrival for each visit, compliance was tested for breath alcohol level (Alco-sensor III; Intoximeters, St Louis, MO), and urine drug (ToxCup; Branan Medical Co, Irvine, CA) and pregnancy (hCG assay, Aimstrip; Craig Medical, Vista, CA).

During the encoding phase visits, participants first completed mood questionnaires and physiological measures were obtained (see “Memory Tasks"). After this, they viewed and rated a set of pictures and then a set of words (unique to each experimental session) before leaving the laboratory. During the retrieval phase visits, participants first completed pre-capsule mood ratings and physiological measures, and then ingested 86 capsules (0 minute) containing placebo or active drug with 100-mL water. Physiological measures were obtained every 30 minutes for the remainder of the visit. Memory testing began 1 hour after capsules were administered (+60 minutes), and lasted roughly 2 hours. Mood and drug effect rating scales were administered multiple times across each session. The sequence of the memory measures was picture recall (+60 minutes), word recall (+75 minutes), picture recognition (+90 minutes), and word recognition (+120 minutes). Participants had breaks of 3 to 5 minutes every half hour during memory testing. At the end of the retrieval phase visits, participants completed an end-of-session questionnaire (ESQ), and were allowed to leave providing residual subjective and physiological drug effects had subsided. All participants were fully debriefed at study completion.

#### **Memory Tasks**

**Materials**

The picture stimuli consisted of 360 pictures drawn from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS36). The pictures were divided into 6 sets of 60, comprised of photographs depicting positive (pleasant), neutral, and negative (unpleasant) scenes (20 each category), according to normative ratings. 

The positive and negative pictures were matched on extremity of valence and arousal. Normed valence ratings of IAPS pictures range from 1 (very negative) to 9 (very positive), and arousal ratings range from 1 (not at all arousing) to 9 (very arousing). 

Positive pictures selected for this study had a mean valence of 7.05 (range, 6-8.34), and mean arousal of 5.58 (range, 4.51-7.35); neutral pictures had a mean valence of 5.07 (range, 4.03-5.99), and a mean arousal of 3.35 (range, 1.72—4.36); negative pictures had a mean valence of 2.73 (range, 1.46-3.92), and a mean arousal of 5.6 (range, 4. S3-7.29)

The word stimuli consisted of 180 personality trait words taken from Anderson.37 The words were divided into 6 sets of 30, each consisting of positive, neutral, and negative personality trait words (10 each category), and the 6 word sets were matched on word length and meaningfulness. Valence categories were assigned based on normed ratings of trait “likableness.”37 Positive trait words selected for this study had a mean likableness of 5.0 (range, 4.6-5.7), mean meaningfulness of 3.7 (range, 3.5-3.9), and an average length of 8.6 letters (range, 4-15); neutral trait words had a mean likableness of 2.7 (range, 2.2-3.5), mean meaningfulness of 3.6 (range, 3.5-3.9), and an average length of 9.0 letters (range, 3-15); negative trait words had a mean likableness of 0.9 (range, 0.3-1.5), mean meaningfulness of 3.7 (range, 3.5-3.9), and an average length of 8.6 letters (range, 4-15)

Encoding Phase During each encoding phase visit, participants first viewed and rated 1 picture set and then 1 word set under drug-free conditions. The stimuli were displayed 1 at a time on a computer screen for 3000 milliseconds each, and were pseudo-randomized such that no more than 2 items from the same valence category were presented consecutively; for the word task, 2 words were not included in the same study set if they had synonymous meanings. Set order was counterbalanced across participants. Participants initiated the presentation of each item using the keyboard.

To ensure that the stimuli would be meaningfully processed, participants were required to rate each item for perceived valence (pictures and words) and arousal (pictures) or meaningfulness (words). 

For the picture task, valence was defined as how positive and how negative participants felt in response to the picture, and arousal was defined as how stimulated, excited, or awake they felt in response.38 For the word task, valence was defined as how positive and how negative an attribute the trait is, and meaningfulness was defined as how much meaning the word had to them. Valence and arousal ratings were self-paced. Valence ratings were measured using the evaluative space grid, 39 a 2-dimensional grid allowing independent ratings of positivity and negativity from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extreme). Arousal and meaningfulness ratings were measured using Likert scales from 1 (not at all) to 9 (very).

Retrieval Phase At the retrieval phase visits 2 days after the encoding visit, memory for the pictures and words was assessed by both free recall and recognition. Picture recall was always assessed first, followed by word recall, picture recognition, and then word recognition. No feedback was provided during memory testing. For the free recall measure, participants were given 15 minutes to write down brief descriptions of as many pic­ tures as they remembered, and 10 minutes to write down as many words as they remembered from their visit 2 days earlier. They were told to provide sufficient detail for the pictures so that raters could discriminate them. Participants also rated each item according to current perceived valence (“positive," “neutral," or “negative”) and how confident they were that they had viewed the item at the previous encoding phase visit (“very confident," “somewhat confident,” or “not confident"). Recalled items were scored as either correct (studied) or intru­ sions (not studied) by 4 independent raters and a fifth rater was used in the event of a split decision; interrater reliability was 97%. (Three percent of picture descriptions could not be reliably scored by raters as “correct/incorrect" because they were either too vague or details were incorrect. Thus, to explore the source of the AMP’s effects on picture recall accuracy, the data were also rescored using a more liberal criterion. In this liberal scoring cri­ terion, items were scored as correct if either [ 1 ] their descriptions contained few details, but could have corresponded to a picture viewed during the respective encoding visit, or [2] minor details of studied pictures were inaccurately remembered. On average, between only 1 and 2 picture descriptions fell in to this ques­ tionable category on each session, and because adopting a more liberal scoring criterion did not substantially affect the findings obtained on this or other measures, only the results from the strict scoring criterion are presented.) Main memory outcome measures included the correct recall rate (proportion of studied items recalled), number of intrusions, and total number of attempts (correct recalls and intrusions combined). For the recognition tests, participants viewed all of the stimuli studied during the respective encoding phase visit (targets), interspersed with an equal number of matched, non­ studied stimuli (lures). These sets were counterbalanced across conditions so that each set appeared in the studied and non­ studied conditions in an equal number of times across partici­ pants. Words with synonymous meanings were not included within the same set. Participants were instructed to identify pictures and words they had seen 2 days earlier during the encoding phase visit (yes/no), rate their confidence of each memory judgment on a Likert scale from 1 (not confident) to 9 (very confident), and to rate each item according to their current perception (ie, valence and arousal/meaningfulness). Main memory outcome measures included hit rate (propor­ tion of studied items correctly identified as studied), false alarm rate (proportion of nonstudied items incorrectly identified as studied), and accuracy (calculated as hit rate minus false alarm rate). This method of subtracting false alarms from hits is widely used to control for changes in base rate responding.49

**Subjective Mood and Drug Response Measures**

#### Subjective  mood  and  drug  effects  were  assessed  using the  Profile  of  Mood  States  (POMS41),  the  Addiction  Research 

Center  Inventory  (ARCI42)  including  marijuana  scale,43  a  modi­

fied  version  of  the  Drug  Effects  Questionnaire  (DEQ44),  and 

an  ESQ.  The  POMS  and  ARCI  were  administered  at  baseline, 

and  60  and  150  minutes  postcapsule,  the  DEQ  was  administered 

at  60,  90,  120,  and  150  minutes  postcapsule,  and  the  ESQ  was 

administered at 210 minutes postcapsule. Drug Effects Questionnaire

On  the  DEQ,  participants  indicate  how  much  they  cur­

rently  feel  a  drug  effect,  like  the  drug’s  current  effects,  dislike the  drug’s  current  effects,  feel  high,  and  would  be  interested  to take  the  same  dose  of  the  same  drug  again  in  the  future.  Par­ ticipants  rated  their  responses  on  100  mm  sliding  scales  from 

“not at all I neutral” to “very much.” Profile of Mood States

The  POMS  is  a  72-item  adjective  checklist  on  which  in­ dividuals  report  their  current  mood  on  a  5-point  scale  from 0  (not  at  all)  to  4  (extremely).  Eight  clusters  (scales)  of  items  are separated  empirically  by  factor  analysis  (Friendliness,  Anxiety, 

Elation,  Anger,  Fatigue,  Depression,  Confusion,  and  Vigor).  Two summary  scales  are  derived  from  the  other  scales:  Arousal  = 

(Anxiety  +  Vigor)  —  (Fatigue  +  Confusion);  Positive  Mood  = 

Elation — Depression. Addiction Research Center Inventory

The  ARCI  is  a  53-item  true-false  questionnaire  with  6 empirically  derived  scales  including  the  Amphetamine  scale which  measures  amphetamine-related  effects;  the  Morphine-

Benzedrine  Group  scale  which  measures  drug-induced  euphoria; the  Lysergic  Acid  Diethylamide  scale  which  measures  dysphoria and  somatic  symptoms;  the  Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine  Group scale  which  measures  sedation;  the  Benzedrine  Group  scale  which 

measures  intellectual  efficiency  and  energy;  and  the  Marijuana scale which assesses cannabis-related effects. End-of-Session Questionnaire

The  ESQ  consists  of  questions  designed  to  measure  par­ ticipants’  perception  of  drug  effects  and  performance  during  the visit,  including  (1)  desire  to  take  the  drug  again  “yes/no,"  (2) 

best  guess  of  drug  received  (eg,  [[stimulant]],  sedative,  marijuana­

like  drug,  or  placebo),  (3)  overall  drug  preference  (sliding  scale 

ranging  from  negative  5  [strongly  dislike]  to  5  [strongly  like]), and  (4)  overall  motivation  to  perform  memory  tasks  to  the  best of  the  individual’s  ability  (sliding  scale  ranging  from  0  [not  at all motivated] to 10 [extremely motivated]).

**Physiologic Effects Measures**

#### Blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  were  measured  shortly  after arrival  on  all  visits,  and  every  30  minutes  postcapsule  during  the 

retrieval  phase  visits,  using  a  portable  digital  blood  pressure 

monitor (A&D Medical/Life Source, San Jose, CA).

**Drugs**

#### Dextroamphetamine  (Barr  Laboratories,  Pomona,  NY)  was 

placed  in  opaque  size  00  capsules  in  doses  of  10  or  20  mg,  with dextrose  filler.  Placebo  capsules  contained  only  dextrose.  Cap­ sules  were  administered  in  counterbalanced  order  under  double­

blind  conditions.  These  doses  enhance  memory  encoding  of  the

**Statistical Analyses**

#### Memory  data  were  analyzed  using  both  (i)  2-way  repeatedmeasures  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  with  drug  dose  (0,  10, and  20  mg  AMP)  and  valence  as  the  within-subjects  factors; and  (ii)  individual  1-way  repeated-measures  ANOVA  to  exam­ ine  the  drug  effects  on  items  of  each  valence  category.  Linear main  effects  of  drug  dose  are  reported  unless  otherwise  speci­ fied.  Where  violations  of  sphericity  were  apparent  in  ANOVA, Greenhouse-Geisser  corrected  results  are  presented,  a  was  set at P  = 0.05  for  all  analyses,  and  trend-level  main  effects  of drug  dose (P  <  0.1)  were  followed  up  by  post  hoc  paired  /  tests, to  examine  dose  dependency.  The  data  from  3  participants  for the  word  recognition  task  were  lost  due  to  a  computer  mal­ function  leaving  an  n  =  28  for  that  measure.  An  analogous approach  was  used  for  subjective  stimulus  evaluation  measures. 

Dextroamphetamine’s  effects  on  subjective  mood  and  drug effect  ratings  and  physiologic  state  were  analyzed  using  mean change-from-precapsule-baseline  values,  calculated  across  the memory  testing  period  (with  the  exception  of  the  DEQ,  which was  not  administered  at  baseline,  and  the  ESQ,  which  was  ad­ ministered only at the session’s end).

### **RESULTS**

#### **Participant Characteristics**

#### A  total  of  31  healthy  young  adults  (16  women)  completed the  study.  Their  average  age  was  22.6  (SD,  3.4)  years,  all  had at  least  a  high  school  education  (mean  [SD],  14.7  [1.7]  years  of education),  and  most  were  white.  Most  reported  low  to  moder­ ate  recent  use  of  alcohol  (8.3  [6.5]  alcoholic  beverages  per week)  and  caffeine  (7.7  [4.7]  caffeinated  beverages  per  week). Six  participants  were  daily  smokers  (12.8  [1.6]  cigarettes/d)  and 4  were  occasional  cigarette  smokers.  Several  reported  some other  recreational  drug  use,  but  most  had  very  little  experience

intrusions;  35%),  or  descriptions  that  were  only  marginally  re­

Dextroamphetamine

Dextroamphetamine  did  not  alter  picture  recognition  ac­ curacy,  or  hit  or  false  alarm  rates,  overall,  or  for  items  of  any valence category in particular (P >0.06).

**Word Recall** Placebo

#### In  the  placebo  condition,  on  average,  participants  recalled 

14%  of  the  studied  words  and  generated  7.7  memory  intrusions (Fig.  1).  Although  the  main  effect  of  word  valence  on  correct recall  missed  significance  (omnibus P  =  0.06),  positive  studied words  were  recalled  more  often  than  negative  studied  words (t30 =  2.7, P  =  0.012;  Table  1).  Studied  words  from  all  norma­ tive  valence  categories  were  recalled  with  equivalent  confidence 

### (P>0.09).

**Effects of AMP on Recall by Subjective Valence** We  also  explored  the  possible  effect  of  AMP  on  emotional bias in recall  using  measures  of  subjective,  rather  than  norma­ tive,  valence.  We  examined  the  number  of  items  generated during  free  recall  that  subjects  had  rated  as  positive,  neutral,  or negative,  regardless  of  whether  their  recalls  were  correct  or incorrect (Fig. 2).

#### **Placebo** In the placebo condition, participants generated signifi­ cantly more “positive” and “negative” than “neutral" picture descriptions (omnibus F2.60 = 16.2, P < 0.001, MSE = 5.77, 7]p

#### <sup>2 = 0.35; both t30>4.5 and P <0.001; “positive” vs “neg­ ative” P =0.22). Likewise during word free recall, participants generated significantly more “positive" than “negative" words (omnibus F2(M= 29.5, P <0.001, MSE = 6.24, i)p</sup>

<sup>2 = 0.5; r30= 3.8, P =0.001), and “neutral" words were generated less fre­ quently than either “positive” or "negative" words (r30> 4.7, P<0.001).</sup>

**Dextroamphetamine** Dextroamphetamine  primarily  increased  the  number of “positive"  picture  descriptions  and  trait  words  generated  during free  recall.  After  AMP,  participants  generated  significantly more  “positive”  picture  descriptions  (Dose  x  Valence: Fi30  = 4.4, P  =  0.044,  MSE  =  3.44, r]p

#### with  normative  data.  Also  as  expected,  participants  rated  both 

normatively  positive  (mean,  4)  and  negative  (mean,  4.6)  pic­ tures  as  being  significantly  more  arousing  than  normatively 

neutral  pictures  (mean,  2.2;  F|  5  44  =  71.7,  P  <  0.001,  MSE  = 

0.97,  T)^  0.71;  both t30  >  9.2  and  P  <  0.001),  although  neg­

ative  pictures  were  rated  as  significantly  more  arousing  than 

positive  pictures  (r30  =  2.9,  P  =  0.007).  Negative  trait  words 

were  rated  by  participants  as  more  “meaningful"  (mean,  5.4) than  neutral  trait  words  (mean,  5)  in  the  placebo  condition  (r27  = 2.2,  P  =  0.035),  although  meaningfulness  ratings  did  not  differ 

between  positive  (mean,  5.1)  and  either  neutral  or  negative  trait 

words  (P  >  0.32),  and  the  main  effect  of  valence  was  not  sig­

nificant (P = 0.25).

**Dextroamphetamine**

#### Participants  rated  positive  trait  words  as  more  “positive"

only)  in  the  AMP  conditions  relative  to  placebo  during  the 

recognition  test.  Other  than  this  general  effect  on  positive  items, AMP  had  minimal  effects  on  participants’  subjective  ratings  of the picture and word stimuli during recognition testing overall.

**Effects of AMP on Subjective Mood, Drug**

#### **Response, and Physiologic Measures**

#### Dextroamphetamine  produced  the  expected  subjective  and 

physiologic  effects  consistent  with  its  profile  as  a  [[stimulant]] 

drug  of  abuse  (see  Table  2,  Supplementary  Digital  Content  2, 

http://links.lww.com/JCP/A215). Participants  preferred  the  ef­

fects  of  AMP  over  placebo,  especially  the  higher  dose,  and  both 

doses  of  AMP  increased  measures  of  positive  mood.  Both  doses 

also  increased  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate,  and  the  higher 

dose  increased  subjective  arousal.  Dextroamphetamine  (20  mg) 

increased  the  motivation  to  complete  the  memory  tests.  Dex­ troamphetamine  (10  mg)  was  identified  as  a  [[stimulant]]  drug 23%  of  sessions,  and  AMP  (20  mg)  was  correctly  identified  on 

55% of sessions.

### **DISCUSSION**

#### We  found  that  AMP  impaired  memory  retrieval  in  healthy young  adults  at  the  same  doses  that  enhanced  memory  forma­ tion  in  previous  studies.627  Dextroamphetamine  did  not  alter 

recall  or  recognition  of  previously  studied  items,  but  it  markedly 

increased  the  number  of  recall  intrusions  and  falsely  recognized test  items.  This  pattern  was  observed  for  both  picture  and  word

stimuli,  and  did  not  depend  on  stimulus  emotionality.  Moreover, the  increase  in  false  recognition  was  accompanied  by  an  in­ crease  in  subjects’  confidence  in  their  ratings,  particularly  for the  pictures,  suggesting  that  the  drug  produced  an  illusion  of 

recollection  rather  than  a  simple  bias  in  endorsing  nonstudied 

items (cf. Roediger and McDermott45).

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  evidence  that  moderate doses  of  a  [[stimulant]]  drug  increase  memory  retrieval  errors. Two  earlier  studies  in  humans  found  similar  doses  of  AMP 

(ie,  0.2  mg/kg  in  healthy  young  adults,26  and  0.5  mg/kg  in  hy­

peractive  children25)  at  retrieval  did  not  affect  recall  of  previ­ ously  studied  neutral  words.  However,  those  studies  did  not 

report  memory  intrusions.  We  found  that  AMP  can  impair  re­ trieval  accuracy  by  increasing  intrusions.  This  finding  that AMP  increases  memory  errors  seems  to  contrast  with  rodent studies  indicating  AMP  enhances  retrieval  of  previously  learned conditioned  motivated  behaviors.22  24  This  discrepancy  could 

be  due  to  a  species  difference,  or  it  could  be  related  to  differ­ ences  in  dose,  route  of  administration,  or  context.  Differences  in the  experimental  procedures  could  also  have  been  an  important 

factor  as  the  rodent  studies  did  not  include  a  measure  of  mem­ ory  intrusions,  and  further  used  behaviors  maintained  by  food 

reward24  or  shock,22  which  are  probably  much  more  salient  than the  emotional  images  and  words  used  in  our  study.  Our  finding that  AMP  can  impair  cognition  at  moderate  doses  has  clear clinical  relevance  as  AMP  is  commonly  prescribed  for  attentiondeficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  to  combat  fatigue  and  in  patients with narcolepsy.

These  retrieval-impairing  effects  of  AMP  are  broadly consistent  with  the  effects  of  other  manipulations  that  heighten arousal  state.  As  noted  previously,  there  are  reports  of  stress 

impairing  memory  retrieval  in  both  humans  and  rodents  (for  a 

review,  see  Wolf29);  however,  this  literature  primarily  concerns studies  in  which  stress  was  administered  before  encoding  rather than  at  the  time  of  retrieval  (see  Smeets  et  al46).  In  a  recent study,  Diekelmann  et  al47  found  that  cortisol  administered  at  the time  of  retrieval reduced  false  recall  of  words  that  were  related to  studied  information,  but  correct  recall  was  also  reduced, suggesting  that  the  cortisol  impaired  memory  in  general.  Thus, although  both  cortisol  and  [[stimulant]]  drugs  seem  to  have 

impairing  effects  on  memory  retrieval,  they  may  have  differen­ tial  effects  on  retrieval  of  studied  information,46  and  false 

recollection.

Interestingly,  AMP  produced  a  positivity  bias  in  partici­

pants’  recall.  That  is,  during  free  recall,  subjects  generated  more subjectively  positive  picture  descriptions  and  personality  trait words.  This  is  consistent  with  the  positive  mood-altering  effects of  AMP,  and  fits  with  the  theory  that  emotional  memory  can 

be  mood-congruent—that  is,  that  people  remember  informa­ tion  better  if  its  valence  matches  their  affective  mood  state  at the  time  of  retrieval  (for  reviews,  see  Eich48  and  Bower  and 

Forgas49).  Drug  users  sometimes  report  that  they  use  drugs to  divert  their  focus  from  negative  life  experiences.56'51  Thus, drugs  may  induce  positive  biases  in  memory  that  could  then 

increase the likelihood of using the drug in the future.

In  summary,  the  present  study  yielded  2  important  find­

ings.  First,  AMP  increased  memory  errors  in  healthy  young adults,  mainly  by  increasing  the  rate  of  intrusions.  This  is  clini­ cally  important  information  for  people  who  use  [[stimulant]]  drugs to  enhance  cognition,  or  in  preparation  for  tests.  This  effect 

might  be  especially  pronounced  if  the  drug  is  combined  with  a stressful  setting.  It  remains  to  be  determined  whether  similar  im­

pairments  are  detected  with  other,  related  drugs,  or  in  patient 

populations.  Second,  AMP  tended  to  positively  bias  memory  re­ call,  an  effect  that  may  contribute  to  AMP’s  abuse  potential.  Taken

together, these findings highlight the importance of characterizing 

the effects of [[stimulants]] and other drugs on memory function.
