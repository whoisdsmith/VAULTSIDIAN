INTRODUCTION

Recently,  there  has  been  concern  that  chronic  ex­ posure  to  amphetamines  may  lead  to  irreversible damage  of  brain  dopamine  (DA)  neurons.  This  con­ cern  has  largely  been  prompted  by  the  discovery  that chronically  administered  amphetamines  produce long-lasting  reductions  in  striatal  DA  content9-12 

14-16,20,  uptake1619’20  and  metabolites1218.  Also,  am­ phetamines  have  been  found  to  cause  long-term  de­ creases  in  striatal  tyrosine  hydroxylase  activity2-6. Numerous  investigators6710-12  have  postulated  that 

amphetamines  induce  these  persistent  presynaptic DA  deficits  by  destroying  DA  fibers.  Direct  morpho­ logical  evidence  supporting  this  view,  however,  is still not complete.

Two  approaches  have  been  taken  in  an  effort  to document  DA  fiber  degeneration  after  ampheta­ mines. The first has made use of fluorescent histochem­ ical  techniques,  the  second  of  silver  degeneration methods.  Studies  using  the  former  approach  have  led to  the  discovery  of  swollen  brightly  fluorescent  stria­ tal  axons  following  amphetamines2-7-10.  This  finding

Further Evidence that Amphetamines Produce Long-Lasting Dopamine Neurochemical 

Methamphetamine  and  amphetamine  were  continuously  administered  to  rats  for  3  days  by  means  of  subcutaneously  implanted  os­ motic  minipumps.  The  total  daily  dose  of  each  drug  was  approximately  4  mg/day.  Dopamine,  norepinephrine  and  serotonin  determin­ ations  two  weeks  later  indicated  that  both  amphetamines  produced  a  selective  striatal  dopamine  depletion.  Anatomical  studies  indi­ cated  that  this  depletion  was  associated  with  striatal  nerve  fiber  degeneration.  To  determine  whether  this  fiber  degeneration  induced by  amphetamines  was  dopaminergic,  the  long-lasting  dopamine  depletion  produced  by  methamphetamine  was  antagonized  with amethyl-para-tyrosine.  This  prevented  the  appearance  of  nerve  fiber  degeneration  after  methamphetamine.  These  findings  suggest that amphetamines produce a long-term striatal dopamine depletion by destroying striatal dopamine nerve fibers.

has  been  taken  to  indicate  that  amphetamines  dam­

age  DA  fibers.  Whether  this  damage  involves  actual 

DA  fiber  destruction,  however,  is  unclear.  Studies 

using  silver  degeneration  methods  have  revealed  de­

generating  nerve  fibers  in  the  striatum  of  rats  admin­

istered  either  high  doses  of  methamphetamine12  or  a 

single  dose  of  amphetamine  in  combination  with 

iprindole13.  Unfortunately,  in  the  first  of  these  stud­

ies 12,  it  could  not  be  concluded  with  certainty  that  the 

degenerating  fibers  were  dopaminergic  since  the 

high  doses  of  methamphetamine  used  produced  both 

DA  and  serotonin  (5-HT)  deficits14.  Also,  these  high 

doses may  have produced  non-specific neurotoxic  ef­

fects.  The  other  degeneration  study13  demonstrated 

fiber  degeneration  after  an  amphetamine-iprindole 

treatment  which  produced  a  selective  long-lasting 

DA  depletion.  While  this  study  certainly  indicated 

that  amphetamine  induced  DA  fiber  degeneration  in 

iprindole-treated  rats,  it  left  unanswered  the  ques­

tion  of  whether  amphetamines  induce  DA  fiber  de­

dole) and  in lower  doses than  in previous  studies pro­

nerve fibers.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals

Subjects  for  this  study  were  male  albino  SpragueDawley  rats  (Holtzman  Co.,  Madison,  WI)  weighing 250  (±  10)  g  at  the  time  drug  treatment  was  initiated. Rats  were  housed  singly  in  wire-mesh  cages  with  ad libitum  access  to  food  and  water.  Ambient  tempera­ ture  was  23  ±  1  °C.  Fluorescent  lighting  was  turned on at 06.00 h and off at 18.00 h.

Drug treatment

Methamphetamine  and  amphetamine  were  contin­ uously  administered  by  means  of  subcutaneously  im­ planted  ALZET  osmotic  minipumps,  models  2001 and 2002. These pumps are specified by the manufac­ turer  to  release  their  contents  at  a  rate  of  1.0 a nd 0 .5 ^1/h  for  7  and  14  days,  respectively.  Pumps  loaded with  the  appropriate  drug  solution  were  implanted subcutaneously  under  light  ether  anesthesia.  After the  desired  treatment  duration,  the  pumps  were  re­ moved,  again  under  light  ether  anesthesia.  Because of  expense,  only  experimental  animals  were  im­ planted  with  pumps.  Control  rats  did,  however,  un­ dergo the same minor surgical procedures.

In  experiment  1,  methamphetamine  was  adminis­ tered  at  various  total  daily  doses  for  various  periods of  time.  Each  daily  dose  and  duration  was  tested  in  a group of  6 rats. Rats  were killed  two weeks  after drug treatment  for  neurochemical  assay.  Specific  daily doses tested  were 1,  2 and  4 mg.  The 1  mg/day dose was  administered  for  3,  6  and  12  days;  the  2  mg/day dose for  1.5, 3  and 6  days and  the 4  mg/day dose  for 0.75,  0.5  and  3  days.  Daily  dose  was  calculated  by multiplying the  rate of  release (in  /zl/h) by  the concen­ tration  of  the  drug  solution  (in fig/fd)  loaded  into  the pump  and  then  multiplying  this  number  by  24.  Pumps were  filled  with  D-methamphetamine  hydrochloride 

dissolved  in  sterile  physiological  saline  at  the  desired concentrations  (50,  100  and  200  wg/ld).  The  drug dose was  expressed as  the base.  When amphetamine was tested  at a  dose of  4 mg/day  it was  necessary to implant  two  2001  pumps  containing  D-amphetamine sulfate  at  a  concentration  of  100  into  each  rat 

because  amphetamine  sulfate  is  less  soluble in  saline 

than methamphetamine hydrochloride.

In  experiment  2,  methamphetamine  and  ampheta­

mine were  administered continuously  at a  dose of  ap­

proximately  4  mg/day  for  3  consecutive  days.  Only 

the  4  mg/day  dose  was  used  since  experiment  1 

showed  this  to  be t he onl y dose of methamphetamine 

that  produced  long-term  neurochemical  effects.  Ten 

rats  received  methamphetamine  and  another  10  re­

ceived  amphetamine.  Of  the  surviving  rats,  5  were 

used  for  confirmatory  neurochemical  assays a nd 3 fo r 

histology.

In  experiment  3,  a-methyl-para-tyrosine  (AMT) 

was  administered  subcutaneously  every  12  h  for  the 

duration  of  the  3-day  methamphetamine  regimen. 

AMT  was  administered  at  a  dose  of  150  mg/kg  of  the 

methyl  ester  hydrochloride  salt.  For  this  experiment, 

10 rats  were administered  methamphetamine and  sa­

line,  10  methamphetamine  and  AMT,  10  AMT  alone 

and  10  saline  alone.  Again,  5  rats  from  each  group 

were used for  neurochemical assays and  3 for histolo­

gy-

Monoamine level determinations

Two  weeks  after  drug  treatment,  rats  were  killed 

for  DA,  5-HT  and  norepinephrine  (NE)  level  deter­

minations  by  cation-exchange  liquid  chromatogra­

phy  coupled  with  electrochemical  detection  as  de­

tailed  elsewhere14.  This  long  post-drug  survival  peri­

od was  used in  an attempt  to assess  toxic rather  than 

pharmacologic  drug  effects.  Monoamines  were 

measured  in  striatal,  hippocampal  and  rest  of  brain 

samples.

Dissection

The  method  for  isolating  the  striatum,  hippocam­

pus and rest of brain has been  described in detail pre­

viously 11.

Fiber degeneration studies

Rats  for  studies  of  nerve  fiber  degeneration  using 

the  Fink-Heimer  method3  (Procedure  I)  were  killed 

one  day  after  drug  treatment.  This  short  survival  pe­

riod  was  used  since  successful  demonstration  of  de­

generating  rat  nigrostriatal  DA  fibers  with  the  Fink-

Heimer  method  is  most  likely  after  a  short  survival 

period 12.  Fink-Heimer  sections  through  the  striatum 

were  evaluated  for  the  presence  or  absence  of  fiber

Materials Osmotic  minipumps  were  purchased  from  the ALZA  Co.,  Palo  Alto,  CA.  D-Amphetamine  sulfate was  obtained  from  the  Sigma  Chemical  Co.,  St. Louis,  MO  and  D-methamphetamine  hydrochloride from  the  National  Institute  of  Drug  Abuse.  DA-hydrochloride,  NE-hydrochloride  and  serotonin  creati­ nine  sulfate  were  all  purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO.

### RESULTS

Experiment 1 Methamphetamine  continuously  administered  at  a dose  of  approximately  4  mg/day  for  3  consecutive days  produced  a  significant  striatal  DA  depletion  two weeks  later  (Fig.  1).  This  same  daily  dose  adminis­ tered  for  shorter  periods  of  time  (1.5  or  0.75  days) did  not  reduce  striatal  DA.  Lower  daily  methamphet­ amine  doses  (2.0  and  1.0  mg/day)  administered  for longer  periods  of  time  (6  and  12  days,  respectively) also  failed  to  significantly  reduce  striatal  DA  content (Fig. 1). Amphetamine  continuously  administered  at  a  dose of approximately  4 mg/day  for 3  days also  produced a significant  striatal  DA  depletion  two  weeks  later.

To  assess  the  selectivity  of  DA-depleting  action  of the  amphetamines,  5-HT  and  NE  levels  were  meas­ ured  in  the  striatum  and  hippocampus.  Neither  stria­ tal  nor  hippocampal  5-HT  level  was  altered  by  either continuous  methamphetamine  or  amphetamine 

(Table  I).  NE  content  of  the  hippocampus  was  also not affected by the amphetamines (Table I).

To  determine  whether  the  long-lasting  selective DA  depletion  induced  by  the  amphetamines  was  re­ lated  to  DA  fiber  degeneration,  the  striatum  of  rats treated  in  parallel  with  those  showing  DA  deficits was  examined  for  evidence  of  fiber  degeneration.  Fi­ ber  degeneration  was  found  both  in  rats  continuously administered  methamphetamine  and  in  those  admin­ istered  amphetamine  (Fig.  2).  Fiber  degeneration was  present  in  every  rat  administered  either  of  the

Experiment 3 To  ascertain  whether  the  striatal  fiber  degenera­ tion  induced  by  the  amphetamines  was  dopaminer­ gic,  the  long-lasting  DA  depletion  produced  by  con­ tinuous  methamphetamine  was  blocked  with  AMT. This  was  done  by  administering  AMT  subcutaneous­ ly at a  dose of 150  mg/kg approximately every  12 h for the  duration  of  the  3-day  methamphetamine  regimen (Table  II).  No  evidence  of  fiber  degeneration  was found in  the striatum  of any  of the  3 rats  administered methamphetamine  in  combination  with  AMT.  Fiber degeneration  was  present,  however,  in  the  striatum of rats administered only methamphetamine.

### DISCUSSION

This  study  sought  to  determine  whether  ampheta­ mines  given  alone  (without  iprindole)  and  in  lower doses than in past studies111214 produced long-lasting

DA  deficits  by  destroying  DA  fibers.  It  has  been found  that  a  4  mg/day  dose  of  methamphetamine given  continuously  for  3  days  produces  a  long-lasting depletion of striatal DA (Fig. 1). Since the rats used

in  this  study  weighed  approximately  250  g,  the  4  mg/ day  dose  is  equivalent  to  approximately  a  16  mg/kg/ day  dose.  This  daily  dose  is  almost  10  times  lower than  that  used  in  our  previous  studies12-14.  Thus,  by administering  methamphetamine  continuously  rath­ er  than  by  means  of  repeated  injections,  it  has  been possible  to  substantially  lower  the  dose  of  metham­ phetamine  required  to  produce  a  long-term  DA  defi­ cit without resorting to the use of iprindole. The  4  mg/day  dose  of  continuously  infused  meth­ amphetamine  did  not  produce  a  persistent  DA  deple­ tion  when  administered  for  only  0.75  or  1.5  days. This  would  seem  to  be  at  odds  with  the  conclusion  of several recent  reports that  a 12-18  h exposure  to am­ phetamine  is  sufficient  to  induce  prolonged  DA  defi­ cits518.  This  apparent  discrepancy,  however,  can  be reasonably  explained  by  postulating  that  when  meth­ amphetamine  is  given  continuously  a  certain  amount of  time  is  needed  before  the  drug  attains  DA  neuro­ toxic levels. At  first,  we  were  surprised  to  find  that  continu­ ously  administered  methamphetamine  did  not  pro­ duce  a  long-term  5-HT  depletion  in  either  the  stria­ tum  or  hippocampus,  two  brain  regions  known  to  be quite  sensitive  to  the  5-HT  toxic  effect  of  repeated high  doses  of  methamphetamine6-14.  We  then  real­ ized  that  our  method  of  continuous  drug  delivery might  be  responsible  for  this  interesting  difference. The  slow  continuous  infusion  of  methamphetamine may  facilitate  metabolic  conversion  of  methamphe­ tamine  into  amphetamine,  which  several  recent  stud­ ies  indicate  does  not  produce  long-term  5-HT  deficits11-16-18.  That  methamphetamine  is  in  fact  metabo­ lized  into  amphetamine  in  rats  has  been  demon­ strated in two previous studies1-8. Having  found  that  continuous  methamphetamine administration  produced  a  selective  long-lasting  DA depletion,  this  finding  was  extended  to  ampheta­ mine.  Like  methamphetamine,  amphetamine  contin­ uously  administered  at  a  dose  of  4  mg/day  for  3  days produced  an  approximately  30%  decrease  in  striatal DA  content  two  weeks  later.  In  agreement  with  pre­ vious  reports11-16-18,  amphetamine  did  not  affect either  5-HT  or  NE  levels.  Thus  both  amphetamine and  methamphetamine  administered  continuously induce  a  selective  long-lasting  depletion  of  striatal DA. To  determine  whether  amphetamines  produced  a 

363

long-lasting  DA  depletion  by  destroying  DA  fibers, the  striata  of  rats  treated  identically  to  those  showing a  DA  deficit  were  examined  for  evidence  of  nerve  fi­ ber  degeneration.  Fine  granular  argyrophilic  debris indicative  of  fiber  degeneration  was  found  in  all  rats continuously  administered  either  of  the  ampheta­ mines.  Given  that  this  fiber  degeneration  is  occurring in  rats  known  to  have  a  selective  long-lasting  DA  de­ pletion,  it  seems  reasonable  to  surmise  that  the  de­ generating striatal DA fibers are dopaminergic.

To  evaluate  this  hypothesis,  the  long-lasting  DA depletion  produced  by  methamphetamine  was blocked  with  AMT.  This  drug  has  been  shown  to  an­ tagonize  not  only  the  pharmacologic,  but  also  the long-lasting  DA  neurotoxic  effect  of  ampheta­ mines5-6.  It  would  be  anticipated  that  if  the  degener­ ating  fibers  are  dopaminergic,  blocking  the  long-last­ ing  DA  depletion  induced  by  methamphetamine  with AMT  should  prevent  the  appearance  of  fiber  degen­ eration  after  methamphetamine.  No  evidence  of  fi­ ber degeneration  was found  in any  of the  rats admin­

istered  AMT  in  combination  with  methampheta­ mine.  The  fact  that  preventing  DA  synthesis  and  de­ pleting  DA  blocks  the  long-lasting  DA  depletion shows  that  the  mechanism  of  degeneration  involves DA,  but  does  not  prove  that  the  cells  seen  to  degen­ erate  are  dopaminergic.  However,  these  results  com­ bined  with  others t hat show  that ste ady-state levels  of 

DA  are  down,  the  number  of  reuptake  sites  are  de­ creased, tyrosine  hydroxylase is  down and  the granu­ lar  debris is  seen  in  areas kn own to  contain substan­ tial  amounts  of  dopaminergic  fibers,  strongly  support the  contention  that  the  degeneration  induced  by  con­ tinuous  methamphetamine  administration  is  dopa­ minergic12.

The  present  findings  extend  earlier  reports  that amphetamine  may  be  toxic  to  striatal  DA  nerve  fi­ bers.  Some  of  these  reports2-7-10  were  based  largely on  results  obtained  with  fluorescence  histochemical methods  which  are  unable  to  directly  demonstrate nerve  fiber  degeneration.  Because  of  this,  Elison  et al.2  prudently  interpreted  the  presence  of  swollen, brightly  fluorescent  axons  in  amphetamine-treated animals  as  being  indicative  of  DA  fiber  damage,  but left  the  exact  nature  of  this  damage  unspecified.  The present  results  indicate  that  this  damage  involves ac­ tual  DA  fiber  destruction.  This  study  also  extends our previous reports of nerve fiber degeneration af-

ter  either h igh  doses  of methamphetamine12 or  a sin­ gle  dose  of  amphetamine  in  iprindole-treated  rats13, since  the  present  results  indicate  that  lower  doses  of amphetamines  also  induce  DA  fiber  degeneration and  that  this  fiber  degeneration  is  induced  by  am­ phetamines in the absence of iprindole.

In  summary,  this  study  has  presented  combined morphological  and  pharmacological  evidence  of striatal  DA  nerve  fiber  degeneration  after  the  contin­ uous  administration  of  both  methamphetamine  and amphetamine.  This  DA  fiber  destruction  would  ap­ pear  to  underlie  the  prolonged  DA  neurochemical changes  reported after  chronic exposure  to  ampheta­ mines.  How  amphetamines  destroy  DA  fibers  re­ mains  to  be  elucidated.  It  may  be  that  amphetamines are  metabolized  into  DA  neurotoxic  compounds  or
