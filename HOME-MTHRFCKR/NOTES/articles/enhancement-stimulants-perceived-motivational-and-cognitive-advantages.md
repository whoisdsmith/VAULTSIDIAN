**INTRODUCTION** Stimulant  medications  such  as  amphetamine  and  methyphenidate have  long been  used by  healthy individuals  to enhance work  performance  (see  Rasmussen,  2008,  for  a  history).  These medications  are  currently  widely  used  as  study  aids  by  college students  in  the  US  and  Canada  (Poulin,  2007;  Smith  and  Farah, 2011)  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  in  many  other  countries  (Sahakian and  Morein-Zamir,  2007;  Franke,  2011;  Castaldi  et  al.,  2012; Partridge  et  al.,  2013),  providing  a  non-hypothetical  case  in  point for neuroethical  analyses of cogni tive enhancement. It  is therefore surprising  that  a  growing  number  of  researchers  now  question whether  these  medications  do,  in  fact,  enhance  cognition  (for reviews,  see  Advokat,  2010;  Chamberlain  et  al.,  2010;  Hall  and Lucke,  2010;  Repantis  et  al.,  2010;  Smith  and  Farah,  2011).  In particular,  comprehensive  reviews  of  the  literature  on  stimu­ lants’  effects  on  healthy  cognition  have  noted  that  there  is  “very weak  evidence  that  putatively  neuroenhancing  pharmaceuticals in  fact  enhance  cognitive  function.”  (Hall  and  Lucke,  2010),  even proposing  “that  stimulants  may  actually  impair  performance  on tasks  that  require  adaptation,  flexibility  and  planning”  (Advokat, 2010).  We  carried  out  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study on  the  effects  of  mixed  amphetamine  salts  (Adderall),  which  was adequately  powered  to  find  medium  effects.  Based  on  our  own failure  to  find  a  single  drug  effect  across  numerous  measures  of executive  functions,  memory,  creativity,  intelligence,  and  stan­ dardized  test  performance,  we  concluded  that  Adderall  “has  no more  than  small  effects  on  cognition  in  healthy  young  adults” 

(llieva et al., 2013).

This  raises  the  question  of  why  people  persist  in  using stimulants  to  enhance  schoolwork  and,  according  to  anecdo­ tal  evidence,  other  cognitively  demanding  duties  such  as  stock trading,  entrepreneurship,  surgery,  and  professional  academic work  (Sahakian  and  Morein-Zamir,  2007;  Franke  et  al.,  2013; Kolker, 2013).  It may  be that  a small  cognitive advantage  is use­ ful in these situations and that is all users seek with continued

Enhancement  stimulants:  perceived  motivational  and 

Psychostimulants  like  Adderall  and  Ritalin  are  widely  used  for  cognitive  enhancement

use.  Alternatively,  it  may  be  that  individual  differences  result  in 

sizeable  cognitive  advantages  for  some  users,  and  they  are  the 

ones  who  use  regularly.  A  third  possibility  is  that  users  gain 

a non-cognitive  advantage  that  helps  them  perform  better  in 

school  and  on  the  job.  This  is  the  alternative  to  be  explored  in 

### **STIMULANTS, COGNITION, AND MOTIVATION**

The question  of whether  stimulant-related positive  affective states 

would  impact  the  performance  of  cognitive  tasks  implies  a  dis­

tinction  between  motivation  and  cognition  and  the  role  for  each 

in work  performance. Because  these terms  have received  various 

definitions in  the past,  we begin  by specifying  the sense  in which 

we use them in the present paper.

By cognition  we  mean  the  processes  of  encoding,  storing, 

and  manipulating  information.  Attention,  memory,  and  executive 

function are examples  of cognitive processes by  this general defi­

nition.  By  cognitive  ability  we  therefore  mean  the  ability  to  carry 

out these processes, which varies among normal healthy people.

We  will  use  the  term motivation  to  refer  to  a  similarly  broad 

set  of  affective  states  that  influence  whether  a  person  will  vol­

untarily  use  their  cognitive  ability  in  the  performance  of  a  task. 

By  this  general  definition,  a  number  of  factors  (which  often, 

but  not  always,  co-occur)  reflect  or  contribute  to  task  motiva­

tion:  namely,  wanting  to  complete  a  task,  enjoying  it  or  being 

interested  in  it.  Motivation  may  also  be  supported  by  closely 

related  factors,  such  as  positive  mood,  alertness,  energy,  and 

the  absence  of  anxiety.  Although  motivation  is  a  state,  there  are 

trait-like  differences  in  the  motivational  states  that  people  typ­

ically  bring  to  tasks,  just  as  there  are  differences  in  cognitive 

These  definitions  of  cognition  and  motivation  correspond 

to  the  “can’t/won’t”  distinction.  The  performance  of  cognitively 

demanding  tasks  are  subject  to  limitations  of  cognitive  ability, 

as  when  a  subject  can’t  perform  beyond  a  certain  level,  and

limitations  of  motivation,  as  when  a  subject  won’t  make  the  effort to  perform  beyond  a  certain  level.  This  distinction  is  admittedly somewhat  vague  and  intuitive,  rather  than  precise  and  analytic, but we  know of  no better  way of  distinguishing between  cognition and motivation in this context. Objective  evidence  that  cognitive  ability  is  only  minimally enhanced  by  stimulants  comes  from  tasks  in  which  motivation  is minimally taxed, as these tasks are typically  tedious and rewarded for  completion  (e.g.,  in  a  representative  study  from  our  lab,  par­ ticipants  completed  about  2  h  of  neuropsychological  tests,  such as  Flanker,  Go/No-Go,  and  NBack,  while  being  compensated uniformly regardless  of performance,  Ilieva et  al., 2013). It is pos­ sible  that  stimulants  enhance  schoolwork  and  other  cognitively demanding  work i n ever yday cont exts where  there is  larger room for  motivated  work:  where  tasks  are  more  intellectually  engag­ ing, where  reward depends on  performance, and where  outcomes determine  users’  future  employability  and  reputation.  To  explore here  the  prediction  that  users  view  stimulants’  benefits  on  moti­ vation  as  equal  or  greater  than  those  on  cognition,  we  begin  by reviewing  the  laboratory  literature  on  stimulants’  effects,  as  well as enhancement  users’ self-reported  reasons for  using stimulants in real-world settings.

**STIMULANT  EFFECTS  ON  MOTIVATION:  LABORATORY  AND  CLINICAL** **CONSIDERATIONS** Animal  research  provides  ample  evidence  that  the  mesolimbic dopamine  system  is  central  to  motivation  (Koob,  1996;  Berridge, 2007;  Faure  et  al.,  2008)  and  stimulant  medications  are  known to  increase  activity  in  this  system  (Butcher  et  al.,  1988;  Drevets et  al.,  2001;  Volkow  et  al.,  2004).  The  first  psychological  effects of these drugs noted by researchers were  increased energy, drive, enjoyment,  and  motivation  (Rasmussen,  2008).  Stimulants  are currently  used  to  treat  apathy  in  neurological  and  psychiatric patients  (Roth  et  al.,  2007).  On  the  basis  of  these  facts  one would  expect  an  effect  of  stimulants  on  motivation  in  normal, healthy  humans  performing  cognitive  tasks.  Although  relatively little  research  has  investigated  this  directly,  the  existing  evidence is consistent with this expectation. Wardle  and  de  Wit  (2012)  studied  the  effect  of  amphetamine on  task  enjoyment.  Healthy  normal  subjects  were  shown  pho­ tographs  from  the  International  Affective  Pictures  set  and  asked to  rate  their  reactions  to  the  stimuli  in  terms  of  emotional valence  and  degree  of  arousal.  The  drug  increased  subjects’ enjoyment  of  all  pictures,  as  assessed  by  self-report.  For  pos­ itive  pictures,  subjects  also  showed  enhanced  enjoyment  by  a decreased  EMG-measured  reaction  of  the  corrugator  (“frown”) muscle  and  elevated  reaction  of  the  zygomatic  (“smile”)  mus­ cle.  Thus,  these  findings  corroborated  stimulants’  effect  on increased  liking  for  task-related  material,  a  factor  contributing  to motivation. Another  way  to  operationalize  motivation  is  through  the amount  of  work  invested  to  obtain  a  reward.  A  recent  double­ blind  placebo-controlled  study  asked  whether  amphetamine increased  the  expenditure  of  effort  for  reward.  Participants  were given a  sequence of  choices between  a high-effort  task promising large  monetary  compensation  and  a  less  effortful,  less  profitable task.  The  low-effort  task  required  participants  to  push  a  button 

repeatedly  with  their  index  finger,  while  the  high-effort  task entailed  a  longer  duration  of  button-pressing,  using  one’s  pinky finger. The  probability of  reward also  varied across  trials, with  the result that  some trials  offered an  uncertain chance  of high  reward for  high  effort,  thus  demanding  high  motivation.  Amphetamine increased  the  proportion  of  high  reward/high  effort  choices. These  results  imply  that  amphetamine  may  enhance  the  moti­ vation  to  work  for  uncertain  rewards  where  the  lack  of  guaran­ tee  of  reward  would  be  expected  to  tax  motivation  maximally 

(Wardle et al., 2011).

Finally,  several  research  groups  have  noted  that  subjects  find stimulants  particularly  rewarding  when  combined  with  perfor­ mance  of  a  cognitive  task  compared  to  the  stimulant  with no  cognitive  task  or  the  cognitive  task  without  a  stimulant. For  example,  after  trying  amphetamine  and  a  benzodiazepine, subjects  chose  to  combine  amphetamine  with  an  attention task  but  not  with  a  relaxation  task  (Silverman  et  al.,  1994a). Subjects  rated  a  mathematical  task  as  more  “interesting”  when performed  with  methylphenidate,  and  showed  disproportion­ ate  striatal  dopamine  release  when  math  was  performed  with the drug, compared to no math or no drug (Volkow et al., 2004)  .  Finally,  subjects  were  more  willing  to  work  to  earn methylphenidate  for  use  while  performing  a  math  task,  com­ pared to  for use  during a  relaxation session  (Stoops et  al., 2005). Similar  findings  have  been  obtained  with  caffeine  (Silverman et al., 1994b) and the novel stimulant modafinil (Stoops et al., 2005) .

**MOTIVATIONAL EFFECTS IN ENHANCEMENT USES OF STIMULANTS** The  question  arises  whether  stimulants’  motivation-elevating influence  remains robust  in real-world  contexts, w here the  setting and nat ure  of work  may be  very different  from laboratory  tasks of motivation.

Most  evidence  on  this  issue  is  indirect.  The  role  of  noncognitive  factors  in  the  use  of  stimulants  for  enhancement  is hinted  at  by  the  elevated  rates  of  depression  and  anxiety  among students who use  them (e.g., Weyandt  et al., 2009;  Rabiner et al., 2010;  Teter  et  al.,  2010;  Dussault  and  Weyandt,  2013).  This  is consistent  with  students  self-medicating  for  psychological  dis­ tress  or  apathy  in  order  to  overcome  emotional  barriers  to  work performance.  Of  course,  the  causal  relations  among  depression, academic  performance,  and  stimulant  use  are  likely  to  be  com­ plex  (Ford  and  Schroeder,  2008)  rendering  these  findings  only suggestive at best.

Surveys  of  students’  reasons  for  using  stimulants  also  indi­ cate  a  role  for  non-cognitive  factors,  but  the  multiple-choice alternatives offered  have not  been designed  to separate  the roles of  cognitive  and  motivational  effects  in  academic  performance enhancement.  Rather,  they  probe  for  reasons  related  to  social­ izing,  recreational  drug  usage  and  academic  concerns,  without distinguishing  the  roles  of  cognitive  and  motivational  effects  on this  last  category  of  reasons.  Results  indicate  that  students  are sensitive  to  the  non-cognitive  effects  and  exploit  them  outside  of schoolwork.  For  example,  students  report  such  reasons  as  get­ ting  “high”  and  having  “fun”  (Teter  et  al.,  2005,  2006;  Boyd et  al.,  2006;  DeSantis  et  al.,  2008,  2009;  Judson  and  Langdon, 2009;  Rabiner  et  al.,  2009;  Clegg-kraynok  et  al.,  2011;  Dussault

and  Weyandt,  2013).  Students  note  mood-elevating  potential of  stimulants  (Carroll  et  al.,  2006;  Rabiner  et  al.,  2009).  When the  surveys  include response  choices  such as  “energy” or  “alert­ ness”  in  their  list  of  reasons  for  using  stimulants,  high  response rates  for  these  items  are  found  (e.g.,  Hall  et  al.,  2005;  Teter et  al.,  2005,  2006;  Boyd  et  al.,  2006;  Carroll  et  al.,  2006;  Judson and  Langdon,  2009;  Clegg-kraynok  et  al.,  2011;  Peterkin  et  al., 2011;  Dussault  and  Weyandt,  2013).  Two  surveys  included  one item  each  that  directly  probed  motivational  effects  in  relation to  schoolwork:  DeSantis  et  al.  (2008)  included  “to  make  work more  interesting”  and  Bavarian  et  al.  (2013)  included  “to  make studying  more  enjoyable”  in  their  list  of  reasons  and  found 

12  and  58%  of  their  respondents,  respectively,  endorsed  these items.

Vrecko  (2013)  took  a  different  approach  to  understanding students’  reasons  for  using  stimulants  as  study  aids,  conducting open-ended  interviews  with  24  university  students  and  former students  who  identified  themselves  as  users  of  Adderall  for  aca­ demic enhancement.  Qualitative data  analyses showed  that users highlighted  stimulants’  positive  influence  on  mood,  energy,  and other  motivation-related  states.  Typical  statements  were  “[on Adderall]  I  didn’t  want  to  stop  what  I  was  doing  until  it  was completed  up  to  a  certain  level  of  my  satisfaction,”  and  “You’re interested  in  what  you’re  doing  even  if  it’s  boring.”  One  respon­ dent  summed  up  the  cognitive  vs.  motivational  effect  this  way: 

“Adderall  doesn’t  necessarily  make  you  smarter  [...],  the  main benefit,  really,  is  that  on  it,  I  don’t  mind  doing  work.”  Vrecko concluded  that  “alteration  of  emotions  appears  to  be  an  impor­ tant  dimension  of  the  drug  effects  that  users  perceive  to  enable improved academic performance.”

In  sum,  while  stimulants’  objectively  measured  effects  on cognition  are  small,  users  tend  to  report  substantial  perceived enhancement  effects.  In  this  paper  we  call  into  question  the assumption that these sizeable perceived effects are purely cogni­ tive. Evidence from many sources is consistent with the hypothesis that  the  motivational  effects  of  stimulants  are  at  least  as  impor­ tant  as  the  cognitive  effects  in  enhancing  students’  academic performance.  However,  with  the  exception  of  Vrecko’s  qualita­ tive  research,  this  evidence  comes  from  research  with  animals and  clinical  populations  and  simple  laboratory  tasks,  or  from surveys  containing  just  one  relevant  response  option.  No  study has  directly  compared  the  perceived  motivational  advantage  of these  medications  to  their  perceived  cognitive  benefit.  To  do  so, we  probe  a  number  of  cognitive  and  motivational  constructs and  quantify  users’  ratings  of  stimulants’  ability  to  enhance them.

Hence,  the  purpose  of  the  present  study  was  to  test,  quan­ titatively,  the  prediction  that  enhancement  users  experience substantial  motivational  advantages  from  stimulants  and  that these  effects  are  as  pronounced  as  or  more  pronounced  than the  cognitive  advantages.  College  student  stimulant  users  with­ out  ADHD  were  asked  to  rate  the  magnitude  of  enhancement drugs’  perceived  effects  on  various  aspects  of  motivation  and cognition.  Our  focus  was  on  the  magnitude  of  the  reported motivational  advantages,  especially  in  comparison  to  the  per­ ceived  cognitive  effects,  previously  assumed  to  be  the  major driver of use.

### **METHODS**

### **PARTICIPANTS**

Participants  were  40  University  of  Pennsylvania  undergradu­

ates  with  no  self-reported  history  of  ADHD  who  had  used 

enhancement  stimulants  at  least  once  in  their  lives1.  Specifically, 

10 participants had used  a stimulant for enhancement just  once, 5 

on 2 occasions, 7 on 3-5 occasions, 7 on 6-9 occasions, 4 on 10-19 

occasions, 2 on  20-39 occasions, and  5 on 40  or more occasions. 

Participants  were  recruited  from  psychology  classes  in  exchange 

for course credit and agreed to participate in a larger survey osten­

sibly  exploring  students’  academic  behaviors  and  beliefs.  One 

hundred  and  seventy-one  potential  participants  were  screened 

out of the survey as non-users of enhancement stimulants.

### **PROCEDURE AND MATERIALS**

Participants  completed  an  online  survey  that  assessed 

past  enhancement  use  and  stimulants’  perceived  effects 2 

Enhancement  use  was  measured  as  the  number  of  occasions  of 

use i n the  past month,  past academic  year, and  in one’s  lifetime. 

The specific prompt,  adapted from Teter et al. (2010), read  as fol­

lows: “On  how many  occasions have  you used  ADHD medication 

(e.g.,  Adderall,  Ritalin,  or  other), without  a  prescription,  to  help 

you do well at school and/or work?”

Students  were  then  asked  to  rate  how  helpful  they  found 

ADHD  medications  for  14  different  psychological  functions  cho­

sen from popular and  scholarly descriptions of cognitive  enhance­

ment  with  stimulants.  They  indicated  their  answers  on  a  7-pont 

scale  from Very  Impairing  to Very  Helpful  (where  the  midpoint 

referred  to No  Effect).  Half  of  the  functions  presented  were 

purely  cognitive,  that  is  functions  that  concerned  cognitive  abil­

ities  and  did  not  carry  any  implication  about  an  individual’s 

affective state.  These were: focused attention,  memory, creativity, 

intelligence,  ability  to  multitask,  speed  of  thinking,  and abstract 

thinking.  The  other  half  of  the  functions  were  non-cognitive 

functions  related  to  motivation  in  that  they  support  task  per­

formance  by  increasing  subjective  energy  and  enjoyment  and 

decreasing subjective effort and avoidance: motivation, task enjoy­

ment, mood, self-confidence,  energy, alertness, and anxiety relief. 

Each  participant  saw  these  items  in  a  different  randomized 

sequence.

### **RESULTS**

The main goal of data analysis was  to assess enhancement users’ 

perceptions of the motivational effects of stimulant medications.

<sup>1 We  chose  to  focus  on  enhancement  use  over  the  lifetime  (as  opposed  to  the</sup> 

<sup>past  month  or  the  past  year)  because  this  approach  rendered  a  maximum</sup> 

<sup>number  of  participants  eligible,  and  hence  allowed  greatest  statistical  power.</sup> 

<sup>Although  participants’  frequency  estimates  over  this  long  period  maybe  prone</sup> 

<sup>to  imprecision,  we  had  no  theoretical  reason  to  restrict  our  sample  to  past-</sup>

<sup>month  or  past-year  users,  potentially  omitting  useful  data  from  use  outside  of</sup> 

<sup>these periods.</sup>

<sup>2 In  addition  to  stimulants’  perceived  effects,  these  40  subjects  and  the  other</sup>

Ilieva and FarahStimulant enhancement: motivational advantages

Analyses  therefore  focused  on  ratings  of  the  medications’  effects on  non-cognitive,  motivation-related  functions.  In  particular, we  assessed:  (1)  whether  users  reported  positive  effects  on motivation-related  functions;  (2)  whether  this  overall  percep­ tion  of  motivational  enhancement  was  greater  than,  less  than,  or equivalent  to  the  overall  perception  of  cognitive  enhancement  in the  narrow  sense,  assessed  by  the  cognition-related  ratings;  and (3)  which  particular  functions  within  each  category  were  believed to be significantly enhanced by these users. Participants  found  that  stimulants  were,  overall,  enhancing  of both  motivation-related  and  cognition-related  functions.  Linear composite  ratings  in  each  category,  with  all  individual  constituent functions  equally  weighed,  indicated  helpfulness  (i.e.,  ratings exceeded  “no  effect”  by  one  sample  t-tests): t;y.p  =  11.17, p  < 0.01 and t^g) = 8.56, p < 0.01, respectively, two-tailed3. In  a  comparison  between  the  enhancing  effects  of  stimulants on  linear  composites  of  motivation  and  cognition,  participants perceived  greater  enhancement  of  functions  in  the  motivational category,  paired-samples  f(39)  =  2.19, p  =  0.04,  two-tailed.  In sum,  for  the  sample  of  functions  used  in  this  project,  enhance­ ment  users  of  stimulants  found  that  the  pills  enhanced  moti­ vation,  and  indeed  reported  that  the  pills  enhanced  motivation significantly more than cognitive ability. Turning  to  the  individual  functions  rated, **Table  1** shows the  means  of  the  perceived  stimulant  effects  on  each  function within  the  two  categories.  A  cognitive  function {attention)  was rated  numerically  most  strongly  enhanced  by  stimulants,  but 

<sup>3 We  used  two-tailed  tests  throughout  our  analyses  to  avoid  overlooking  unex­ pected  scenarios,  including  the  possibility  that  users  may  view  stimulants  as impairing  to  a  given  ability,  or  the  possibility  that,  as  the  neuroethics  literature has  traditionally  suggested,  the  perceived  effects  on  cognition  might  outweigh those on motivation.</sup>

it  was  not  rated  significantly  higher  than  the  next  three  in descending  order:  energy,  alertness,  and  motivation,  by  pairedsamples  t-tests:  [t(39)  =  0.82, p  =  0.42; t^g)  =  0.77, p  =  0.45; and  t(39)  =  0.85, p  =  0.40,  respectively].  Equivalence  testing, with  differences  <0.5  points  on  the  7-point  scale  stipulated  to  be equivalent,  suggested  that  the  standard  90%  confidence  interval 

(Walker  and  Nowacki,  2011)  of  the  difference  between  the  vari­ ables  ([—0.13,  0.38],  for  the attention-energy  contrast;  [—0.18; 0.48],  for  the attention-alertness  contrast;  [—0.15,  0.45],  for  the attention-motivation  contrast)  fell  within  the  equivalence  interval of [—0.50; 0.50]. Taken  together, null-hypothesis  and equivalence tests  converged  to  suggest  that  attention  ratings  were  compara­ ble  to  the  ratings  on  the  three  highest  rated  motivation-related functions.

Considering  all  of  the  functions  (motivational  and  cogni­ tive)  examined,  most  but  not  all  were  rated  as  significantly enhanced,  12  of  the  14  ratings  of  enhancement  significantly differed  from  “no  effect”  using  a  series  of  one-sample  t-tests 

**(Table** 1).  Correcting  for  multiple  comparisons  by  dividing  the critical p-value  of  0.05  by  14,  11  functions  remain  rated  as  sig­ nificantly  enhanced  by  this  more  appropriately  conservative  cri­ terion.  These  included  6  motivational  functions  and  5  cognitive functions.

These findings remained  generally unchanged  after (a)  exclu­ sion  of  2  participants  with  univariate  outlier  ratings  falling  more than  3  SD  away  from  the  mean  of  the  other  40  participants  of the sample  and (b)  after exclusion  of the  subsample of  10 partic­ ipants  who  used  stimulants  for  enhancement  only  once  in  their lifetime4.

<sup>4 With  the  exception  that,  in  (b),  no  evidence  for  equivalence  emerged  for  the comparison  between  ratings  of alertnessand attention,and  only  five  functions in the motivation category showed significant perceived enhancement.</sup>

Ilieva and FarahStimulant enhancement: motivational advantages

**DISCUSSION** There  is  an  emerging  consensus  in  the  literature  on  cognitive enhancement  that  the  cognitive  benefits  of  prescription stimulants  are  modest.  The  most  commonly  used  medications for  cognitive  enhancement,  amphetamine  and  methylphenidate, seem  to  have  limited  effects  on  laboratory  measures  of  exec­ utive  function  and  learning  in  normal,  healthy  young  adults. Nevertheless, these  drugs are  widely used  to enhance  work per­ formance  by  college  students  and  others  engaged  in  cognitively demanding  work.  In  the  present  article  we  explored  the  possibil­ ity  that  these  drugs  are  used  to  enhance  motivation  rather  than, or in addition to, cognition.

Recent  laboratory  evidence  suggests  that  amphetamine  and methylphenidate  enhance  motivation-related  processes  in  healthy participants,  and  the  in-depth  interviewing  conducted  by  Vrecko 

(2013)  indicates  that  enhancement  users  find  the  motivational effects  of  these  drugs hel pful for  enhancing school work. Here  we add to  the laboratory,  survey, and  interview evidence  by perform­ ing the  first survey  directly comparing  users’ ratings  of stimulants’ motivation- and cognition-enhancing effects.

The present study  found that student  users perceive stimulants as  beneficial  for  cognition,  despite  the  weak  evidence  for  objec­ tive  cognitive  enhancing  effects  (see  Introduction).  However, student users  also perceive  stimulants as  advantageous for  moti­ vation. Motivation,  energy,  and attention,  the  functions  viewed as  most  strongly  enhanced,  did  not  differ  in  their  susceptibil­ ity  to  stimulants’  subjective  effects.  Not  only  were  motivational functions  found  by  users  to  be  significantly  enhanced,  they  were found  to  be  somewhat  more  enhanced  as  a  group  than  a  cate­ gory  of  cognitive  functions,  and  this  difference  was  statistically significant.  This  finding  extends  previous  knowledge  by  demon­ strating that  stimulants’ motivational  effects are  viewed by  healthy users  as  prominent  despite  the  common  assumption  that  they work  chiefly  on  cognition.  Although  our  study  is  limited  to

assessing perceived  enhancement  and  does  not  speak  to  actual 

behavioral  effects  on  motivation,  cognitive  processing,  or  task 

performance, the  results document  experiential effects  relevant to 

users’  decisions  to  practice  enhancement  with  prescription  stim­

ulants.  According  to  students  who  use  stimulants  for  cognitive 

enhancement, these drugs may enable better performance of cog­

nitively  demanding  work  at  least  in  part  through  their  effects  on 

motivation.

These  patterns  of  data  emerged  despite  measurement  limi­

tations,  including  the  assessment  of  enhancement  effects  over 

a  lengthy  period  of  time,  potentially  conducive  to  recall  errors 

in  participants’  estimates.  Future  research  should  address  ques­

tions  unexamined  in  the  present  study,  including  the  possible 

moderation  of  perceived  motivational  effects  by  specific  medica­

tion  (e.g.,  amphetamine  vs.  methylphenidate)  or  dose  (high  vs. 

low). Additionally,  further research  is needed  to show  whether the 

motivational effects  of these  drugs are  particularly valuable  under 

conditions of fatigue or sleep deprivation.

The  present  data  support  the  hypothesis  that  enhancement 

users  rely  on  ADHD  medication  for  boosting  drive,  energy,  and 

mood,  rather  than  cognitive  capacity  alone.  Thus,  our  study 

opens  up  novel  avenues  for  future  research.  How  do  individual 

differences  and  different  types  of  academic  work  moderate  the 

effects discussed  here? How  does stimulant-enhanced  motivation 

affect actual  performance? Do  the present  conclusions, regarding 

enhancement  uses  of  stimulants,  also  apply  to  therapeutic  uses 

in  neuropsychiatric  disorders?  What  alternative  interventions  for 

improving  achievement  motivation  might  be  possible,  with  fewer 

risks than prescription stimulants?
