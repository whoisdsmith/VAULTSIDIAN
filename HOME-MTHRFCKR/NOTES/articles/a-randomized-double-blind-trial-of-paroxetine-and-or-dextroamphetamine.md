## **ABSTRACT** **Background:** The  ability  to  recognize  and  diagnose attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  has increased  in  recent  years.  The  persistence  of  ADHD symptoms  puts  adolescents  with  ADHD  at  risk  for long-term adverse psychosocial outcomes. **Objective:** The  primary  goal  of  this  study  was  to  as­ sess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  mixed  amphetamine salts  extended  release  (MAS  XR)  in  the  management of adolescents with ADHD. **Methods:** This  was  a  Tweek,  randomized,  multi­ center,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallelgroup,  forced-dose-titration  study.  Adolescents  aged 13  to  17  years  with  ADHD  were  randomized  to  1  of 4  active  treatments  (MAS  XR  10,  20,  30,  or  40  mg/d) or  to  placebo.  All  doses  were  given  in  the  morn­ ing.  This  study  used  a  forced-dose-titration  design  in which  patients  randomized  to  the  10-mg/d  group  re­ ceived  1  dose  of  10  mg/d  for  4  weeks.  Patients  ran­ domized  to  the  20-mg/d  group  received  1  dose  of 10  mg/d  for  the  first  week  and  1  dose  of  20  mg/d  for the  remaining  weeks;  patients  randomized  to  the 30-mg/d  group  received  1  dose  of  10  mg/d  for  the  first week,  1  dose  of  20  mg/d  for  the  second  week,  and 1  dose  of  30  mg/d  for  the  remaining  2  weeks;  and patients  randomized  to  the  40-mg/d  group  received 1  dose  of  10  mg/d  for  the  first  week,  1  dose  of  20  mg/d for  the  second  week,  1  dose  of  30  mg/d  for  the  third week,  and  1  dose  of  40  mg/d  for  the  fourth  week.  The primary  efficacy  measure  was  change  from  baseline to end point in the ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-

**266Volume 28 Number 2**

RS-IV)  score.  The  secondary  efficacy  measure  was  the 

score  on  the  Clinical  Global  Impressions-Improvement 

(CGI-I)  scale  for  ADHD.  ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores 

were  analyzed  post  hoc  in  patients  with  low  base­ line  ADHD-RS-IV  severity  (ie,  patients  with  baseline 

ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  less  than  the  median)  and high  baseline  ADHD-RS-IV  severity  (ie,  patients  with 

baseline  ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  greater  than  the median).  Safety  was  assessed  by  recording  adverse 

events,  vital  signs,  and  body  weight  at  all  study  visits 

and 30 days after drug discontinuation.

**Results:** Of  the  287  randomized  adolescents,  258 completed  the  study.  The  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  popula­ tion  included  278  patients.  The  majority  of  patients were  male  (65.5%)  and  white  (73.7%).  The  mean weight  (57.8  kg  [127.1  lb])  at  baseline  and  the  mean height  (163.8  cm  [64.5  in])  at  screening  were  compa­ rable  across  all  MAS  XR  treatment  groups.  Patients in  the  placebo  group  had  a  mean  weight  of  59.8  kg 

(131.6  lb)  and  a  mean  height  of  166.1  cm  (65.4  in). Most  (56.5%)  of  the  patients  had  ADHD  combined inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive  subtype.  Two  hun­

dred  nineteen  (78.8%)  patients  were  treatment  naive, 

and  59  (21.2%)  had  received  treatment  for  ADHD 

within 30 days before screening. ITT analysis of the

ADHD-RS-IV  revealed  statistically  significant (P  < 0.001)  improvement  in  mean  ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores in  all  4  MAS  XR  treatment  groups,  compared  with placebo,  at  all  weeks  throughout  the  4-week  study; the  mean  change  from  baseline  to  end  point  was  -17.8 in  the  MAS  XR  10-  to  40-mg/d  groups  and  -9.4  in  the placebo  group.  Significant  treatment  effects  were  ob­ served  in  both  the  ADHD-RS-IV  inattentive  (P  <  0.001) and  hyperactive-impulsive  (P  <  0.001)  subscales  from 

baseline.  In  patients  with  low  baseline  ADHD-RS-IV severity,  statistically  significantly  (P  <  0.01)  greater improvements  were  observed  in  the  MAS  XR  20-,  30-, and  40-mg/d  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group;  in  pa­ tients  with  high  baseline  ADHD-RS-IV  severity,  sta­ tistically  significantly  (P  <  0.02)  greater  improvements were  observed  in  all  active  treatment  groups  compared with  placebo.  On  the  CGI-I  scale  at  end  point,  a  high­ er  percentage  of  adolescents  in  all  MAS  XR  treatment groups  were  considered  improved  (MAS  XR  10  mg/d, 

51.9%  [P  <  0.01];  20  mg/d,  66.0%  [P  <  0.001]; 

30  mg/d,  70.7%  [P  <  0.001];  40  mg/d,  63.9%  [P  < 0.001])  compared  with  adolescents  receiving  placebo 

(26.9%).  The  most  common  adverse  events  in  patients receiving  MAS  XR  versus  placebo  were  anorexia/ decreased  appetite  (35.6%  vs  1.9%),  headache  (16.3% vs  22.2%),  insomnia  (12.0%  vs  3.7%),  abdominal pain  (10.7%  vs  1.9%),  and  weightloss  (9.4%  vs  0%). Most  adverse  events  were  mild  or  moderate  in  inten­ sity (97.5%); no serious adverse events were reported.

**Conclusions:** The  adolescents  with  ADHD  treated with  10-  to  40-mg/d  MAS  XR  up  to  4  weeks  had  sig­ nificant  improvements  in  ADHD  symptoms  compared with  those  who  received  placebo.  Results  of  this  study suggest  that  once-daily  dosing  with  MAS  XR  up  to 40  mg  was  effective  and  well  tolerated  for  the  man­ agement  of  ADHD  in  these  adolescents.

Revision  (DSM-IV-TR),1  the  use  of  rating  scales,  an 

expansion  of  mental  health  services,  and  increased 

public  awareness.2  The  estimated  prevalence  of  ADHD 

is  2%  to  18%,3  and  up  to  65%  of  children  with  a  diag­

nosis  of  ADHD  continue  to  exhibit  symptoms  of  the 

disorder into adolescence and adulthood.4

The  persistence  of  ADHD  symptoms  puts  adoles­

cents  with  ADHD  at  risk  for  long-term  adverse  psy­

chosocial  outcomes.  Adolescents  with  ADHD  can  ex­

perience  substantial  problems  with  academic,  social, 

and  behavioral  functioning.5  ADHD  in  adolescents 

has  been  associated  with  learning  problems,  academic 

failure,  low  self-esteem,  impairments  in  relationships, 

deficits  in  social  skills,  nicotine  use,  alcohol  and  sub­

stance  abuse,  and  an  increased  incidence  of  driving 

violations  and  motor  vehicle  accidents.5-10  In  addi­

tion,  adolescents  with  ADHD  are  at  risk  for  comorbid 

ADHD  treatment  options  include  pharmacologic 

and  psychosocial  therapy,  with  stimulant  therapy  being 

the  most  widely  prescribed  and  effective  treatment  for 

ADHD. 2’18-23  The  results  of  multiple,  randomized, 

controlled  trials  document  the  effectiveness  of  stimu­

lant  medications  for  the  management  of  ADHD  across 

age  groups,19’23-25  but  most  of  the  current  ADHD  re­

search focuses  on children  6 to  12 years  of age.26 There­

fore,  the  scientific  literature  that  specifically  examines 

the  efficacy  and  safety  of  stimulants  in  the  treatment 

of adolescents with ADHD is very limited.13’27

Mixed amphetamine salts  extended release (MAS  XR)* 

is  a  once-daily,  single-entity  amphetamine  approved  by 

the  US  Food  and  Drug  Administration  for  the  man­

agement  of  ADHD  in  children  aged  6  to  12  years  and 

in  adults.  The  primary  objective  of  the  current  study 

was  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  MAS  XR  in  the 

management of adolescents with ADHD.

The  efficacy  and  safety  of  MAS  XR  in  the  management

mary  diagnosis  of  ADHD  combined  subtype  (predom­ inantly  inattentive  subtype  or  hyperactive-impulsive subtype),  were  eligible  for  the  study.  Key  inclusion  cri­ teria  were  an  intelligence  quotient  score  >80,  normal 

blood  pressure  (girls—systolic  blood  pressure,  128-

132  mm  Hg;  diastolic  blood  pressure,  84-86  mm  Hg; 

boys—systolic  blood  pressure,  130-140  mm  Hg;  dia­ stolic  blood  pressure,  84-89  mm  Hg),28  electrocardio­ graphic  (ECG)  findings  within  the  normal  range,  and a  willingness  and  ability  to  comply  with  protocol  re­ quirements  in  conjunction  with  a  parent  or  caregiver. Adolescents  who  were  known  to  be  nonresponsive  to stimulants  (defined  as  no  clinical  improvement  after trials  of  2  stimulant  medications,  taken  for  at  least 3  weeks  each)  or  naive  to  stimulant  treatment  were  eli­ gible for enrollment.

Exclusion  criteria  included  comorbid  illness  that could  interfere  with  study  participation  or  impact  the efficacy  and  tolerability  of  MAS  XR;  a  history  of  non­ response  to  stimulant  medication;  a  documented  al­ lergy  or  intolerance  to  MAS,  MAS  XR,  or  ampheta­ mines;  and  medication  use  (not  including  ADHD medication)  that  could  affect  blood  pressure  or  heart rate.  Other  exclusion  criteria  included  a  current  co­ morbid  psychiatric  diagnosis  except  oppositional  defi­ ant  disorder,  hypertension,  history  of  seizure  disorder within  the  last  2  years,  tic  disorder,  Tourette’s  syndrome, abnormal  thyroid  function,  cardiac  disorder,  and  sig­ nificant  laboratory  abnormalities.  In  addition,  patients with  a  history  of  drug  abuse  or  who  were  current abusers  of  drugs  or  other  substances  or  who  had  a parent or guardian who abused drugs were excluded.

All  activities  were  conducted  in  accordance  with the  Declaration  of  Helsinki.  The  appropriate  institu­ tional  review  boards  at  each  research  site  approved the  study  protocol,  all  amendments,  and  informedconsent  forms.  Before  undergoing  any  activities  per­ taining  to  the  study,  written  informed  consent  was obtained  from  each  patient’s  parent/guardian,  along with documentation of assent by the patient.

**Study Design**

The  study  consisted  of  a  washout  phase  in  which patients  were  required  to  discontinue  all  current  ADHD medications  for  1  week  up  to  4  weeks,  depending  on the  medication  the  patient  was  taking.  The  washout period  was  followed  by  the  double-blind  treatment phase,  during  which  patients  were  randomized  in  a 

1:1:1:1:1  ratio  to  receive  MAS  XR  10,  20,  30,  or 

**268Volume 28 Number 2**

40  mg/d  or  placebo.  All  doses  were  given  in  the  morn­

ing.  This  study  used  a  forced-dose-titration  design  in 

which  patients  randomized  to  the  10-mg/d  group  re­

ceived  1  dose  of  10  mg/d  for  4  weeks.  Patients  ran­

domized  to  the  20-mg/d  group  received  1  dose  of 

10  mg/d  for  the  first  week  and  1  dose  of  20  mg/d 

for  the  remaining  weeks;  patients  randomized  to  the 

30-mg/d  group  received  1  dose  of  10  mg/d  for  the  first 

week,  1  dose  of  20  mg/d  for  the  second  week,  and 

1  dose  of  30  mg/d  for  the  remaining  2  weeks;  and  pa­

tients  randomized  to  the  40-mg/d  group  received 

1  dose  of  10  mg/d  for  the  first  week,  1  dose  of  20  mg/d 

for  the  second  week,  1  dose  of  30  mg/d  for  the  third 

week,  and  1  dose  of  40  mg/d  for  the  fourth  week. 

**Figure 1** illustrates the dosing schedule.

At  screening  and  end  point,  patients  underwent  a 

physical  examination,  a  brief  neurologic  examination, 

and  a  12-lead  ECG.  Clinical  laboratory  tests,  includ­

ing  hematology,  blood  chemistry,  urinalysis,  and  thy­

roid  function,  were  performed  and  height  was  recorded 

at  screening  and  end  point.  A  urine  drug  screen  was 

performed  at  screening  and  baseline.  Vital  signs,  in­

cluding  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures,  pulse, 

and  sitting  respiratory  rate,  were  checked  and  body 

weight  was  measured  at  all  study  visits.  Adverse  events 

(AEs) were recorded at each visit.

**Efficacy Measurements**

The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  the  ADHD 

Rating  Scale-IV  (ADHD-RS-IV),29  which  consists  of 

18  items  designed  to  reflect  the  presence  of  ADHD-

related  symptoms  based  on DSM-IV-TR  criteria. 

ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  range  from  0  to  54,  with 

higher  scores  indicating  more  severe  symptoms.  The 

secondary  efficacy  measure  was  the  Clinical  Global 

Impressions  (CGI)  scale.30  At  screening  and  baseline, 

investigators  administered  a  CGI-Severity  (CGI-S)  as­

sessment  to  establish  the  severity  of  baseline  ADHD 

symptoms.  The  CGI-S  scale  assesses  the  severity  of  the 

patient’s  condition  on  an  8-point  rating  scale  ranging 

from  0  (not  assessed)  to  7  (among  the  most  extremely 

ill).  At  each  weekly  study  visit,  improvement  relative 

to  baseline  ADHD  symptoms  was  assessed  by  the  in­

vestigator  using  the  CGI-Improvement  (CGI-I)  scale. 

The  CGI-I  scale  is  an  8-point  scale  ranging  from  0 

(not  assessed)  to  7  (very  much  worse),  with  4  indicat­

ing no change.

ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  were  analyzed  post  hoc 

according to intended dose separately for patients

To  detect  an  effect  size  of  0.78  on  the  ADHD-RS-IV 

scale  between  one  MAS  XR  group  and  the  placebo group  at >95%  power  and  an  a  level  of  0.05  (2-tailed) using  a  2-sample t  test,  it  was  necessary  to  randomize ~45  patients  to  each  of  the  5  treatment  groups.  The primary  efficacy  analysis  was  conducted  on  the  change from  baseline  of  the  ADHD-RS-IV  scores  at  the  end point  for  the  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population  using  a 2-way  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model.  Each dose  of  study  drug  was  compared  with  placebo  using the  ANCOVA  model  at  the  0.05  level  by  including treatment  (MAS  XR  10,  20,  30,  and  40  mg/d,  and placebo),  site,  and  the  baseline  score  (covariate).

least  squares  mean  difference,  the  average  of  observa­ tions  associated  with  MAS  XR  versus  placebo,  was calculated.  To  control  the  type  I  error  rate  at  the  0.05 level  and  adjust  for  multiplicity,  the  significant  treat­ ment  effect  of  each  dose  of  MAS  XR  versus  placebo was  based  on  a  closed  testing  procedure  starting  from the  40-mg/d  dose.  The  analysis  was  conducted  using SAS  statistical  software  version  2.0  or  higher  (SAS Institute,  Inc.,  Cary,  North  Carolina);  type  III  estima­ tion  was  reported.  The  ADHD-RS-IV  total  score  from 

baseline  through  the  final  double-blind  study  visit  was analyzed  using  the  same  model  used  for  the  primary efficacy  analysis,  allowing  for  an  examination  of  the effects  of  dose  titration  for  patients  in  the  10-  and 40-mg/d treatment groups.

The  secondary  efficacy  analyses  were  also  conduct­ ed  using  the  ITT  population.  The  CGI-I  scale  was  ana­

lyzed  using  a  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  test,  adjusting for  study  site  to  examine  the  difference  in  the  propor­ tion  of  patients  improved  at  treatment  end  point  be­ tween  MAS  XR  doses  combined  versus  placebo.  If  the treatment  effect  was  statistically  significant (P  <  0.05), each  dose  of  MAS  XR  was  compared  with  placebo  at the  0.05  level  using  the  same  test.  The  significant  treat­ ment  effect  of  each  dose  of  MAS  XR  versus  placebo was  based  on  a  closed  testing  procedure  starting  with the  40-mg/d  dose.  The  patient’s  score  on  the  CGI-I  scale was  analyzed  as  a  dichotomous  variable:  improved 

(includes  “very  much  improved”  and  “much  improved”) or  not  improved  (includes  all  other  assessments).  Using the  same  analysis,  the  CGI-I  score  at  end  point  was analyzed  according  to  intended  dose  and  final  dose separately  for  the  ITT  patients  with  low  and  high ADHD-RS-IV scores at baseline.

The  combined  dosage  groups  were  evaluated  in  the secondary  analysis  to  first  determine  an  overall  effect on  the  CGI-I.  If  significance  was  determined  in  the overall  analysis,  then  each  dose  group  was  analyzed for significance separately.

### **RESULTS**

**Study Population**

The  disposition  of  the  287  patients  enrolled  in  the study  is  shown  in **Figure  2;** 258  patients  completed  the study.  Demographics  and  baseline  characteristics  for the  patients  in  the  ITT  population  are  listed  in **Table  I.** The  majority  of  patients  were  male  (65.5%)  and  white 

(73.7%).  The  mean  weight  (57.8  kg  [127.1  lb])  at baseline  and  the  mean  height  (163.8  cm  [64.5  in])  at 

**270Volume 28 Number 2**

screening  were  comparable  across  all  MAS  XR  treat­

ment  groups.  Patients  in  the  placebo  group  were  heav­

ier,  with  a  mean  weight  of  59.8  kg  (131.6  lb),  and 

taller, with a mean height of 166.1 cm (65.4 in).

Most  (56.5%)  of  the  patients  were  diagnosed  with 

ADHD  combined  inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive 

subtype,  and  the  disorder  subtypes  were  distributed 

proportionally  across  all  treatment  groups.  Of  the 

278  patients  in  the  ITT  population,  219  (78.8%)  were 

treatment  naive,  and  59  (21.2%)  had  received  treat­

ment  for  ADHD  within  30  days  before  screening.  Ap­

proximately  30  patients  weighing  >75  kg  (>165  lb) 

were  randomized  in  a  secondary  cohort  not  evaluated 

here.  The  sample  size  in  this  cohort  was  not  based  on 

the  power  analysis;  rather,  it  was  based  on  an  estimate 

of  -10%  to  15%  of  the  adolescent  study  patients 

falling  into  this  weight  category  and  was  intended  to 

provide  preliminary  descriptive  safety,  efficacy,  and 

dosing information for these patients.

Patients  in  all  groups  had  improvement  in  ADHD-

RS-IV  total  scores  from  baseline  to  end  point,  but  sta­

tistically  significant  (P  <  0.001)  improvements  in  the 

ADHD-RS-IV  total  score  compared  with  the  placebo 

group  were  found  in  all  4  MAS  XR  treatment  groups 

(10,  20,  30,  and  40  mg/d)  beginning  the  first  week  of 

treatment.  These  statistically  significant  improvements 

in  the  MAS  XR  treatment  groups  were  sustained 

throughout  the  4-week  treatment  period.  The  mean 

ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  for  the  active  treatment 

groups  combined  (MAS  XR  10-40  mg/d)  were  signif­

icantly  improved  compared  with  placebo (P  <  0.001). 

The  mean  change  from  baseline  was  -17.8  for  all  pa­

tients  receiving  MAS  XR  10  to  40  mg/d  and  -9.4  for 

patients  in  the  placebo  group.  The  mean  ADHD-RS-IV 

total  scores  were  significantly  (P  <  0.005)  improved  for 

each  active  treatment  group  compared  with  placebo 

**(Figure  3).** The  end  point  data  for  the  subscales  were 

also  statistically  significant  (inattentive:  MAS  XR,  -10.2; 

placebo,  -6.1  [P  <  0.001];  hyperactive-impulsive: 

MAS XR, -7.6; placebo, -3.2 [P < 0.001]).

When  ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  were  analyzed  by 

intended  dose  separately  for  patients  with  low  base­

line  severity  and  high  baseline  severity,  the  mean  de­

crease  was  greater  in  patients  with  high  baseline 

severity  than  in  patients  with  low  baseline  severity  for

somnia.  The  incidence  of  anorexia  and  weight  loss  in­ creased  with  an  escalation  in  dose  up  to  30  mg/d.  All cases  of  anorexia  were  mild  or  moderate;  2  of  the  5  pa­ tients  who  were  discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  AEs had experienced anorexia.

AEs  considered  possibly  or  probably  related  to  the study  medication  occurred  in  33.3%  of  the  patients receiving  placebo  and  56.2%  of  the  patients  treated with  MAS  XR.  Most  AEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in intensity  (n  =  199  of  204  patients  [97.5%]).  The  5  AEs 

(1.7%)  categorized  by  the  investigator  as  severe  were headache  (n  =1),  diarrhea  (n  =  1),  increased  aspartate aminotransferase  (AST)  level  (n  =1),  insomnia  (n  =  1), and  twitching  (n  =1).  With  the  exception  of  increased AST  levels,  all  AEs  were  considered  possibly  or  prob­ ably  related  to  the  study  medication.  There  were  no serious AEs reported.

Twenty-two  patients  (7.9%)  reported  weight  loss as an  AE, and  17 of  these patients  also reported  anorex­ ia  as  an  AE.  All  cases  of  weight  loss  were  mild  or  mod­ erate,  and  no  patient  was  discontinued  from  the  study

**DISCUSSION** The  current  study  found  that  MAS  XR  has  benefits  in the  management  of  adolescents  with  ADHD.  Patients treated  with  MAS  XR  had  significant  improvements in  ADHD  symptoms  compared  with  patients  receiving placebo,  as  determined  by  the  ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores and the CGI-I scale.

Significant  statistical  improvement  was  found  in the  total  scores  on  the  ADHD-RS-IV  for  adolescents in  the  MAS  XR  treatment  groups  beginning  during the  first  treatment  week  and  continuing  through­ out  the  4-week  study.  The  greatest  improvement  in symptoms  was  observed  in  the  MAS  XR  20-mg/d group,  with  ADHD-RS-IV  total  scores  decreasing  by 

>20  points  from  baseline  to  end  point.  Statistically significant  treatment  effects  were  detected  in  both  the hyperactive-impulsive  and  inattentive  subscales  of  the ADHD-RS-IV.  Although  patients  with  both  high  and low  baseline  severity  scores  had  significant  improvement in  ADHD-RS-IV  scores,  patients  with  high  baseline severity  scores  had  a  greater  decrease  in  ADHD-RS-IV scores  than  did  patients  with  low  baseline  severity scores.  Furthermore,  patients  with  ADHD  inattentive

Scores  on  the  CGI-I  scale  further  suggest  the  ef­

ficacy  of  MAS  XR  10  to  40  mg/d  in  the  treatment  of 

adolescents  with  ADHD.  There  appeared  to  be  a  time­

dependent  treatment  effect,  with  maximal  improve­

ment  achieved  by  week  4.  At  that  time,  the  percentage 

of  patients  considered  statistically  significantly  im­

proved  ranged  from  57.1%  in  the  MAS  XR  10-mg/d 

group  to  70.0%  in  the  MAS  XR  20-mg/d  group. 

Additional  studies  are  needed  to  determine  if  adoles­

cents  treated  with  MAS  XR  demonstrate  increased 

improvement  in  symptoms  with  longer  courses  of  drug 

treatment  and  if  the  short-term  effects  of  MAS  XR  are 

In  the  current  study,  adolescents treated  with MAS  XR

Adolescents  in  the  30-  and  40-mg/d  treatment groups  did  not  receive  their  final  assigned  dose  until the  third  and  fourth  week  of  the  study,  respectively; therefore,  they  may  not  have  remained  at  the  higher dose  levels  for  an  adequate  length  of  time  to  realize  in­ creased  efficacy  and  to  achieve  optimal  dose  levels.  To 

better  assess  the  efficacy  of  various  doses  of  MAS  XR in  the  treatment  of  adolescents  with  ADHD,  addition­ al  studies  should  be  conducted  using  an  optimal-dose design in  which study  investigators can  adjust the  dosage of  MAS  XR  individually  in  adolescents  in  10-mg  in­ crements for the best possible efficacy and tolerability.

MAS  XR  was  well  tolerated  at  all  doses  studied, and  the  safety  profile  was  similar  to  that  observed  in previous  studies  of  younger  patients  with  ADHD  who were  treated  with  MAS  XR  as  well  as  in  studies  of other  stimulants.34-36  The  most  common  AEs  in  this study  were  anorexia/decreased  appetite,  headache,  in­

sults  are  consistent  with  previous  studies  of  MAS  XR 

in  children  with  ADHD.32’33  In  a  study  of  584  chil­

dren  aged  6  to  12  years  who  were  diagnosed  with 

ADHD,  and  which  was  designed  to  assess  the  safety 

and  efficacy  of  MAS  XR,  the  most  common  AEs  were 

anorexia/decreased  appetite  (22%),  headache  (18%), 

insomnia  (17%),  abdominal  pain  (14%),  and  emo­

tional  lability  (9%).33  A  similar  pattern  of  common 

AEs  emerged  in  a  study  of  51  school-aged  children  di­

agnosed  with  ADHD,  conducted  in  an  analog  class­

room  environment,  who  were  treated  with  MAS  XR 

10,  20,  and  30  mg/d.32  Common  AEs  included  ner­

vousness,  anorexia/decreased  appetite,  insomnia,  head­

ache,  and  abdominal  pain.  In  the  current  study,  a 

dose-dependent  increase  in  the  incidence  of  anorexia 

was  observed.  Studies  of  other  psychostimulants  have 

reported a similar pattern of AEs.19’34’35

The  beneficial  results  seen  in  this  study  are  similar 

to  those  of  other  recent  studies  investigating  the  effi­

cacy and safety of stimulant therapy in the treatment

**Limitations**

The  primary  end  point  for  this  study  was  the ADHD-RS-IV,  and  the  main  cohort  of  the  study  in­ cluded  patients  weighing  <75  kg.  To  detect  an  effect size  of  0.78  on  the  ADHD-RS-IV  scale  between  one active  dose  group  and  the  placebo  group  at  >95% power  and  an a  level  of  0.50  (2-tailed)  using  a  2-sample t  test,  it  was  necessary  to  randomize  ~45  patients  in each  dose  group.  This  yielded  a  total  of  -225  patients weighing  <75  kg  to  be  randomized  for  the  main  co­ hort  in  the  double-blind  portion  of  the  study.  Studies involving  a  sample  size  larger  than  30  would  be  need­ ed  to  evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  MAS  XR  in adolescents  weighing  >75  kg.  In  addition,  studies  of longer  duration  would  confirm  the  findings  observed in this 4-week study.

**CONCLUSIONS** Overall,  the  results  of  this  placebo-controlled,  forceddose-titration  study  indicated  that  statistically  signifi­ cant  improvements  in  core  ADHD  symptoms  occurred in  these  adolescents  with  ADHD  who  received  MAS  XR compared  with  placebo.  Significant  scores  on  the ADHD-RS-IV  were  reported  in  patients  taking  MAS  XR 

10,  20,  30,  and  40  mg/d.  Significantly  more  adoles­ cents  treated  with  MAS  XR  were  considered  improved 

adolescents.
