In recent years aesthetics has grown into a rich and varied discipline. Its scope has widened to embrace ethical, social, religious, environmental, and cultural concerns. As international communication increases through more frequent congresses and electronic communication, varied traditions have joined with its historically interdisciplinary character, making aesthetics a focal center of diverse and multiple interests. These need a forum that is universal and inclusive, easy to access, and unhampered by financial, political, and institutional barriers. An on-line publication offers an ideal opportunity for advancing these purposes and _Contemporary Aesthetics_ endeavors to provide that forum.

_Contemporary Aesthetics_ is an international open-access journal that is free to all readers and authors. While _CA_ is mostly volunteer-driven and is partially supported by the Rhode Island School of Design and the Department of Philosophy at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, significant costs are involved in making this journal available to the scholarly community, and we welcome contributions large and small. Your support helps _Contemporary Aesthetics_ continue to offer a high quality online scholarly journal. As a non-profit organization, we are dedicated to staying an independent publication free from the costs and compromises of for-profit publishing operations. The full amount of your contribution will go directly to support the journal. If you would like to help support this effort, please click on the button below. Thank you for your generous support.
