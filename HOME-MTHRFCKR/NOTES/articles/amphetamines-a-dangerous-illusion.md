## **Amphetamines: A Dangerous Illusion**

# **GEORGE R. EDISON, M.D., Salt Lake City. Utah**

**Amphetamines are among the most dangerous of** **currently abused psychoactive drugs. They cause** **dependence, behavioral toxicity, and physical damage.** 

**Despite their extensive medical use, the evidence** **suggests they are ineffective or minimally effective in** 

**most of the conditions for which they are prescribed.** **Their widespread use in medical practice is more likely** **the result of the euphoria and the dependence they** 

**induce than of any significant clinical results. This** 

**paradox, presented by the legality of amphetamine use,** 

**compounds the difficulty of treating youthful drug** **abusers and educating potential abusers. The following** 

**recommendations are urged: prescription of these** 

**drugs should, with few exceptions, cease; and** **production should be sharply curtailed and probably bo** 

**limited to one or two pharmaceutical companies.**

T  HE rapidly  increasing  abuse  of  amphetamines 

among  the  young  makes  it  important  to  revaluate  the status  of  this  group  of  agents  in  medical  practice.  Are 

they  valuable  drugs,  and  in  what  conditions?  What results  can  be  expected  from  their  use?  What  is  their 

mode  of  action?  To  what  extent  are  they  indispen­

sable?  What  are  their  hazards?  How  often  do  these 

hazards  occur?  Does  their  medical  use  have  any  in­

fluence  on  their  illegal  use?  This  article  briefly  re­

views  evidence  suggesting  that  the  amphetamines  are 

both  ineffective  and  unsafe,  offers  speculations  about 

why  we  continue  to  use  them,  and  recommends 

changes in the way we use them.

ephedrine,  and  other  sympathomimetic  amines,  was 

synthesized  in  1927.  Shortly  thereafter,  descriptions 

of  its  effects  on  blood  pressure  and  nasal  congestion 

began  to  appear.  Within  5  years  it  was  found  to  act 

as  a  bronchodilator  and  a  respiratory  stimulant  and 

also  to  have  remarkable  effects  on  the  central  nervous 

system,  specifically  cerebral  stimulation  and  reduc­

tion  in  appetite.  Because  of  these  central  effects,  sev­

eral  authors  warned  of  the  possibility  of  dependence 

and  tolerance  as  early  as  1937.  These  warnings  are 

Despite  the  warnings,  the  amphetamines  and  their 

uses  have  proliferated  to  an  amazing  degree.  The  list 

of  "accepted”  medical  indications  for  their  use  now 

includes  obesity,  mild  depressive  reactions,  epilepsy, 

parkinsonism,  central  nervous  system  depression 

caused  by  barbiturates  and  other  sedative-hypnotics, 

narcolepsy,  and  hyperkinetic  reactions  of  children. 

They  have  also  been  used  widely  to  maintain  alert­

ness and to increase physical performance.

The  1970  edition  of  the Physicians’  Desk  Refer­

ence   (2)  lists  65  amphetamine  and  amphetamine-

like  preparations  produced  by  40  companies.  These 

are  available  either  as  single-drug  preparations  or  in 

combination  with  salicylates,  barbiturates,  tranquiliz­

ers,  and  other  substances.  One  can  obtain  a  choice  of 

vitamins  or  hormones  along  with  an  amphetamine  in 

15  preparations  from  14  companies.  This  listing  does 

not,  of  course,  exhaust  the  preparations  available 

In  four  cases  companies  describe  in  the Physicians’ 

Desk  Reference  the  amphetamine  they  produce  and 

only  one  other  product.  In  four  other  cases  the  am­

phetamine is the company’s sole listed product.

What  amount  of  amphetamines  is  legally  manufac­

tured?  No  one  knows  exactly.  Estimates  range  from 

5 billion to 8 billion doses a year. The Food and

Drug  Administration  estimated,  for  example,  that over  100,000  lb  were  available  in  the  United  States in  1962—enough  to  supply  each  man,  woman  and child  with  250  mg  (3).  About  one  half  of  this  sup­ ply is thought to be diverted into illegal channels (4).

**Effectiveness of Amphetamines**

While  production  has  flourished,  the  list  of  in­ dications  has  gradually  withered,  for  three  reasons: [1]  For  such  conditions  as  parkinsonism,  epilepsy, and  depressive  reactions  newer  kinds  of  treatment have  simply  proved  more  effective;  [2]  for  severe central  nervous  system  depression  from  drug  intoxi­ cation  it  is  now  accepted  that  no  drug  is  as  effective as  other  treatment  such  as  artificial  ventilation,  sup­ port  of  the  circulation,  and  hemodialysis  (5);  [3]  for obesity  control,  now  the  commonest  reason  for  use, it  has  slowly  become  obvious  that  although  appetite­ suppressants  may  have  some  temporary  utility,  they are ineffective in long-term treatment.

Narcolepsy  and  hyperkinetic  reactions  of  children remain  the  two  conditions  for  which  amphetamines are  still  said  to  have  effect  For  narcolepsy,  however, methylphenidate  is  "the  present  drug  of  first  choice,” according  to  the Cecil-Loeb  Textbook  of  Medicine 

(6);  for  hyperkinetic  reactions  preliminary  evidence suggests  that  if  any  drug  is  indicated,  imipramine  may be  more  effective  than  amphetamines  (7),  so  that even here good alternatives may be available.

The  two  commonest  reasons  for  prescribing  am­ phetamines  are  depression  and  obesity,  and  it  is  for 

these  conditions  that  we  must  examine  most  carefully 

the evidence for amphetamine effectiveness.

**<sup>NONEFFECTIVENESS  IN  MILD  DEPRESSIVE</sup>**<sup></sup> 

**<sup>REACTIONS</sup>**

Depressive  reactions  include  a  variety  of  syn­ dromes  with  a  wide  range  of  severity  and  a  strong natural  tendency  toward  spontaneous  remission. Their  very  diversity  makes  evaluation  of  any  treat­ ment  extraordinarily  difficult.  Yet,  common  to  many depressed  persons  are  conflicts  around  oral-depend­ ent  needs,  which  suggests  that  drugs  such  as  alcohol, barbiturates,  and  amphetamines  be  used  with  caution because  of  their  ability  to  produce  dependence.  In­ deed,  depression  is  the  underlying  mood  in  many,  if 

not  most,  high-dose  amphetamine  abusers  or  "speed freaks” (8}.

But  many  doctors  ask  if  amphetamines,  although theoretically  dangerous,  are  nonetheless  a  useful  and practical  measure  for  treating  mild  depressions.  Tra­ dition  grants  them  a  position  of  sorts  in  the  treatment of  mild  cases,  although  recommendations  for  their use  are  becoming  increasingly  rare  (for  example,  the 

Downloaded from ======https://annals.org====== by Tulane University user on 01/12/2019

1968  edition  of  Noyes’ Modern  Clinical  Psychiatry 

ignores  them).  Occasionally  one  finds  a  favorable 

mention,  as  in  Mendelson’s  article  (9)  in  Freedman 

and Kaplan’s textbook of psychiatry:

The  amphetamines  are  often  useful  and  sometimes 

gratifyingly  efficacious  in  lifting  the  spirits  in  a  mild 

depression.  When  antidepressive  medication  is  re­

sorted  to,  the  amphetamines  should  probably  be 

tried  before  prescribing  the  newer  antidepressive 

drugs.

Virtually  no  authority,  however,  supports  their  use 

for  more  than  an  immediate  euphoriant  lift,  and  most 

believe  that  they  have  no  place  at  all  in  the  treatment 

of  depression.  According  to  Jarvik,  in  Goodman  and 

Gilman’s  text,  (10),  no  well-controlled  long-term 

study  has  been  able  to  demonstrate  their  effective­

ness.

The sympathomimetic amines, such as amphetamine 

and  phenmetrazine,  and  similarly  acting  central 

nervous system stimulants, such as methylphenidate 

and  pipradrol,  were  tried  in  the  treatment  of  de­

pression  and  found  wanting  except  in  certain  mild 

cases i n which  a drug-induced  acute euphor ic state 

would suffice....

The report of an AMA committee states (3):

Published  studies  have  indicated  that,  in  general, 

dextroamphetamine  is  only  slightly  more  effective 

than a placebo in ameliorating depressive symptoms.

Cole  and  Davis  (11),  also  writing  in  Freedman 

and Kaplan’s textbook, review the evidence thus:

Amphetamine  was  found  to  be  less  effective  than 

placebo in the treatment of d epressed outpatients by 

British  general  practitioners.  ...  In  still  another 

British study, amphetamine also proved less effective 

than  phenelzine,  and  no  better  than  placebo,  in  the 

treatment  of  depression.  In  a  Veterans  Admin­

istration  study,  dextroamphetamine  was  no  more 

effective  than  placebo  in  treating  hospitalized  de­

pressed patients.

In  a  recent  review  of  the  pharmacologic  treatment 

of depressions Schildkraut (12) states:

The  psychomotor  stimulants  (for  example,  amphet­

amine,  methamphetamine  and  methylphenidate) 

cause  mood e levation,  increased  alertness and  en­

hanced  performance  in  normal  subjects.  These 

drugs  may  alleviate  some  of  the  symptoms  of  de­

pression  in  certain  depressed  patients,  but  such 

beneficial  effects  are  often  transient  and  may  be 

accompanied by a number  of unwanted side-effects. 

...  It  is  fairly  generally  agreed  that  the  psycho­

motor  stimulants  have  relatively  little  to  offer  in  the 

treatment of major depressive disorders.

term  problem  with  major  social  and  psychological determinants.  Frequently  recognized  psychological factors  are  chronic  tension  and  depression,  unusually strong  oral  dependent  needs,  inability  to  tolerate  frus­ tration,  and  substitution  of  food  for  other  forms  of gratification.  These  psychological  characteristics  may lead  to  dependence  on  many  kinds  of  drugs  as  well  as on  food.  As  in  the  case  of  depressive  reactions,  it may  be  illogical  to  include  in  the  treatment  of  such  a condition  drugs  that  have  a  strong  potential  for  caus­ ing  dependence.  “In  fact,  the  use  of  amphetaminetype  drugs  is  contraindicated  for  alcoholic  persons and other dependence-prone persons” (3). Short-Term  Effect:  It  is  granted  by  most  that  am­ phetamines  can  induce  a  period  of  appetite  suppres­ sion  and  increased  weight  loss  for  a  few  weeks. Whether  this  is  of  lasting  value  is  questionable,  how­ ever,  since  in  most  cases  obesity  continues  to  be  a problem  over  a  period  of  years.  Very  few  short-term gains  in  treatment  of  obesity  have  been  translated into  long-term  successes.  More  importantly,  it  is likely  that  short-term  effectiveness  is  caused  more  by a  stimulant  effect  than  by  any  direct  effect  on  the  ap­ petite  control  center  of  the  brain.  Thom  and  Bondy (13), in their textbook article, state: As  a  result  of  stimulation,  or  a  "lift,”  the  patient’s drive  toward  overeating  may  be  significantly  modi­ fied  and  as  far  as  he  is  concerned,  the  over-all effect  of  the  drug  is  "appetite-depressing.”  Obvi­ ously.  drugs  which  create  such  a  state  of  euphoria may lead to habituation in certain individuals. Modell (14) pointed out in his 1960 report: Central stimulation, not  a specific central  depressant effect  on  appetite,  is  then  the  common  mechanism through  which  these  drugs  act;  it  is  clear,  there­ fore,  why  undesirable  central  stimulant  effects, which  have  constituted  their  chief  clinical  limitation, have  thus  far  appeared  to  be  indivisible  from anorexigenic action. In  other  words,  obese  patients  may  use  the  drugs  in the  same  way  the  "speed  freak"  does—to  obtain  a “high.” There  is  also  some  doubt  whether  amphetamines are  effective  in  the  short  term.  Again  from  Modell’s report (14): The  amphetamines  present  special  problems  in  the evaluation  of  their  effectiveness.  Patients  often promptly  recognize  the  drug  by  one  or  another of  the  central  stimulant  effects  (usually  the  "lift”). Thus,  they  can  distinguish  between  drug  and placebo  when  these  are  used  in  what  theoretically appears  to  be  a  well-designed  clinical  evaluation with  a  double-blind  control.  In  patients  with emotional  disturbances  particularly,  who  include most  compulsive  overeaters,  the  ability  to  distin­

guish  medication  from  placebo  by  any  effect  other than  the  one  under  examination  (in  this  case weight loss)  makes it  exceedingly difficult  to prevent bias  and  psychological  factors  from  shaping  the 

apparent effects of the drug. Long-Term  Effect:  Thom  and  Bondy  (13)  evaluate pharmacological treatment of obesity as follows: Depression  of  appetite  by  a  pharmacologic  agent 

can  facilitate  weight  loss,  although  it  is  apparent 

that  as  soon  as  the  pharmacologic  effect  wears off, or  the  medication  is  discontinued,  appetite  will 

return and  weight gain  will recur  unless the  patient's 

inherent  capacity  to  control  his  food  intake  has been altered  fundamentally. That the  pharmacologic agent  used  for th ese p urposes  be devoid  of serious 

toxic side effects is axiomatic [emphasis added).

Unfortunately  there  is  no  pharmacologic  agent available  at  this  time  which  acts  primarily  by depressing the "appetite center." In  her  textbook  article  Albrink  (15)  devotes  3,600 words  to  the  treatment  of  obesity.  This  is  her  discus­ sion of amphetamines: Drugs.  Appetite-suppressant  drugs  of  the  amphet­

amine  group  are  effective  for  only  a  few  weeks. Dependence  on  their  stimulatory  effect  occasionally makes  withdrawal  a  problem.  Such  drugs  have  no demonstrated  role  in  the  long-term  management  of obesity. Reinforcing  this  opinion  is  the  report  of  the  AMA Committee  on  Alcoholism  and  Addiction  and  Coun­ cil on Mental Health (3):

In  long-term  (more  than  a  few  weeks)  programs of  weight  reduction,  the  superiority  of  these  sub­

stances to placebo has not been demonstrated. In  1959  Stunkard  and  McLaren-Hume  (16)  re­ viewed  the  literature  on  the  treatment  of  obesity. Their summary states: A  review  of  the  literature  on  outpatient  treatment 

for  obesity  reveals  that  the  ambiguity  of  reported results  has  obscured  the  relative  ineffectiveness of  such  treatment.  When  the  per  cent  of  patients losing  20  and  40  pounds  is  used  as  a  criterion  of success,  the  reports  of  the  last  thirty  years  show remarkably  similar  results.  Although  the  subjects of  these  reports  are  grossly  overweight  persons, only  25%  were  able  to  loss  as  much  as  20  pounds and only 5% lost 40 pounds. In 1966 Glennon (17) reported a follow-up: Review  of  the  literature  since  1958  did  not  reveal a  successful  long-term  study  using  a  diet  regimen by  itself  or  in  combination  with  drugs,  psychologic treatment, or an exercise program. Astwood  (18)  is  even  more  negative  in  his  evalu­ ation  of  all  methods  of  treatment,  including  the  phar­ macologic,

AU  of  us  know  that  we  can’t  get  fat  people  to become  slim  by  suggesting  a  diet,  so  we  conclude, for the time being at least, that obesity is incurable. Modell  (14)  reemphasizes  the  point  in  the  sum­ mary of his report: New  and  logical  pharmacotherapy  for  persons  who overeat  will  more  likely  come  with  understanding of  the  processes  involved  than  through  the  current practice  of  developing  more  variations  on  old themes which  have already  been well  exploited and have  not  satisfied  the  need.  There  is  really  nothing new  on  the  scene.  There  are  no  "anorexiants"  to fit specific disturbances  in eating patterns,  and there are  no  useful  depressants  of  the  appetite  center, wherever  it  may  be.  .  .  .  Current  pharmacotherapy for  persons  who  overeat  has  limited  use.  Insofar as  drugs  are  concerned,  at  the  very  best,  their potential  is  secondary  to  the  elimination  of  the cause of  the hyperphagia.  Drugs which  give assist­ ance  along  the  lines  now  available  provide  short­ lived symptomatic relief only. Despite  30  years  of  extensive  use,  then,  the  place of  amphetamines  in  clinical  practice  is  far  from  estab­ lished.  They  represent  the  treatment  of  choice  for only  a  small  number  of  those  patients  for  whom  they are  prescribed.  Their  effectiveness  in  treating  obesity and depressive reactions is minimal and controversial. Interestingly,  the  pharmaceutical  industry  teUs  us indirectly  that  the  amphetamines  and  related  drugs offer  only  a  low  order  of  effectiveness  by  constantly introducing  new  congeners  and  combinations.  For  ex­ ample,  in  the  1970 Physicians'  Desk  Reference  eight companies  have  listed  nine  “new”  amphetamine  prod­ ucts  not  listed  in  the  1968  edition.  The  industry  sends the  same  message  in  another  more  encouraging  way; within  the  last  2  years  four  companies  have  voluntar­ ily  discontinued  their  production  of  amphetamines (Methedrine®,  Burroughs  Wellcome;  Phetobese®, Cole; T.V.D. Formula'®, Lambda; Ad-Nil®, Medics).

**Hazards of Amphetamines** The  irony  of  the  amphetamine  situation  is  that whereas  we  have  been  slow  to  admit  the  negligible utility  of  these  agents,  we  have  also  been  slow  to  rec­ ognize  their  dangers.  Their  illegal  and  casual  use  as stimulants  of  the  central  nervous  system  has  grown tremendously.  They  have  become  perhaps  the  most serious  drug  of  abuse  in  the  United  States  (as  in  sev­ eral  other  countries),  except  in  the  large  cities,  where heroin  addiction  is  widespread.  Most  physicians  are not  yet  sufficiently  familiar  with  these  hazards,  which are  well  documented  elsewhere  (1,  3,  8,  19-22). Briefly,  they  fall  into  all  three  major  areas  of  concern in psychoactive drugs. 1.  Amphetamines are a ssociated with tolerance 

Downloaded from ======https://annals.org====== by Tulane University user on 01/12/2019

and  with  an  intense psychological  dependence,  which makes  it  difficult  to  withdraw  from  the  drug  without help.  High-dose  use  may  begin  in  a  pattern  of  illegal experimentation,  but  it  may  also  begin  with  a  physi­ cian’s  well-intended  prescription.  The  nature  of  the drug’s  effects  leads  easily  to  progressively  increasing dosage  in  susceptible  persons.  Prediction  of  “susceptibles”  cannot  be  made  with  confidence,  but  patients for  whom  amphetamines  are  prescribed  are  probably, by  the  very  nature  of  their  illnesses,  among  those  most likely  to  increase  the  dose  and  become  dependent. Then  begins  a  prolonged  struggle  to  discontinue  drug use,  an  effort  usually  attended  by  intense  lethargy  and depressive  symptoms.  The  period  of  depression  dur­ ing  the  withdrawal  (or  “crash”)  is  frequently  associ­ ated  with  suicidal  feelings  and  actions.  The  absence of  physical  dependence  in  amphetamine  abuse  may give  the  impression  that  it  is  easier  to  withdraw  from than  heroin.  This  has  not  generally  been  the  case;  in fact,  the  reverse  may  be  true,  although  data  on  this point are lacking.

2.  The behavioral  toxicity  of  high  doses  is  usually such  that  the  user  cannot  maintain  work,  school,  or family  relationships.  With  high  doses  a  typical  psy­ chosis  often  develops,  characterized  by  hyperactivity, distortions  of  reality,  impaired  judgment,  paranoid ideation,  and  hallucinations.  Despite  this  disturbance, the  sensorium  is  clear,  and  the  individual  may  appear superficially normal (19).

3.  The physical  toxic  effects  on  the  autonomic nervous  system  and  cardiovascular  system  include sympathetic  gastrointestinal  and  urinary  symptoms, occasional  systolic  and  diastolic  hypertension,  some­ times  cardiac  arrhythmias  (8,  21),  and  possible  nec­ rotizing  angiitis  (22).  In  addition,  malnutrition,  hep­ atitis,  and  other  serious  infections  are  associated  with the intravenous use of these drugs.

These  are  the  major  toxic  manifestations  of  illegal, high-dose  amphetamine  use.  But  damage  also  results from  the  less  spectacular  adverse  reactions  to  small, legally  prescribed  amounts  and  may  cause  disability for  greater  numbers  of  people.  These  case  examples are familiar to most practicing physicians:

Case  1:   A  23-year-old  male  first-year  medical  student 

asked  his  physician  for  stimulants  to  help  him  overcome classroom drowsiness, difficulty  in studying, and  mild de­ pression.  He  did  not  have  narcolepsy.  Dextroamphet­ amine,  5  mg  daily,  was  prescribed.  He  was  asked  to 

return  but  did  not.  When  next  seen,  he  had  flunked  out 

of  school.  Although  not  the  sole  factor  in  this  patient’s failure,  the  amphetamine  obviously  did  not  help  his studying and  may have  been a  critical determinant  in his avoiding early, appropriate counseling.

Case   2;  To  control  her  appetite  a  47-year-old  woman had  used  various  amphetamines  almost  daily  for  10 **608 April 1371 • Annals of Internal Medicine • Volume 74 * Number 4**

years. Despite  this, she  was grossly  obese. She  realized that  she  had  continued  to  take  the  medication  largely to  avoid  lethargy  and  to  get  through  each  day.  She  was now  attempting  to  withdraw  but  was  finding  herself  de­ pressed,  gaining  weight,  unable  to  mobilize  enough  en­ ergy to  keep her  house clean,  fighting with  her husband, and  blaming  herself  for  all  her  children's  personal  prob­ lems  because  she  had  worked  while  they  were  growing up. Her use of amphetamines had  allowed her to manage her  personal a nd fa mily p roblems  in wa ys she  no l onger considered  appropriate  and  had  provided  a  comfortable alternative to counseling (which she had tried unsuccess­ fully).  With  the  children  grown,  menopause  reached, and  husband  alienated,  she  was  now  decompensating without the drug. Case  3:  A  20-year-old  female  student  was  welladjusted  but  occasionally  depressed  in  the  face  of  reli­ gious conflicts b etween strict parents  and a m ore relaxed 6anc6.  With  marriage  and  a  job  6  months  away,  she felt  the  need  to  lose  some  weight  even  though  she  was not  obese.  She  approached  her  physician  for  diet  pills. He  reluctantly  prescribed  30  Desbutal  Gradumet® tablets,  each  containing  10  mg  of  methamphetamine hydrochloride  and  60  mg  sodium  pentobarbital.  She  lost 7  lb  in  the  next  30  days.  She  also  engaged  in  her  first coitus  during  this  period,  experiencing  deep  guilt.  After finishing  the  prescribed  amount  she  felt  lethargic  and depressed  Four  days  after  taking t he l ast  tablet  she h ad fights  with  her  fianed  and  her  sister,  became  very  upset and  depressed,  and  impulsively  ingested  30  tablets  of a  sedative-analgesic  (Fiorinal®),  each  containing  50  mg of  an  intermediate-acting  barbiturate  (butalbital).  She was  hospitalized  moderately  intoxicated,  and  recovered. For  this  girl  the  combination  of  major  emotional  con­ flicts  and  the  depression  caused  by  amphetamine  with­ drawal led to a suicide attempt. It  is  important  to  recognize  that  these  patients were  giving  their  physicians  a  common  message:  they needed  help  with  an  emotional  problem.  The  physi­ cian’s  response  to  the  overt  request  for  a  pill  pre­ vented him from providing help for the real problem.

**Why Are Amphetamines Still Being Prescribed?** Why  are  drugs  of  such  dangerous  potential  and  so little  objective  advantage  still  in  wide  use?  Amphet­ amines  are,  after  all,  not  life-saving  agents.  Several explanations are possible: 1.  Most  physicians  have  not  had  an  opportunity to  observe  a  seriously  affected  high-dose  amphet­ amine abuser or “speed freak." 2.  Most  physicians  feel  a  need  to  offer  something to  the  patient  trying  to  lose  weight,  both  physician and  patient  often  sensing,  but  not  verbalizing,  that they  are  dealing  with  a  problem  nearly  untreatable  in traditional terms. 3.  The  economic  value  of  amphetamine  sales  is substantial,  judging  from  the  industry's  enthusiastic promotion  of  these  agents  despite  the  serious  ques­ tions about their utility.

4.  Tens  of  thousands  of  respectable  adults  are  to some  extent  dependent  on  them  and  exert  suasion  on their physicians to continue prescribing them.

5.  Physicians  themselves  use  and  abuse  psycho­ active  drugs  more  often  than  the  general  population 

(23).  This  suggests  that  sometimes  they  may  also have  difficulty  objectively  evaluating  the  use  of  these drugs for their patients.

6.  It  is  possible  that  amphetamine  popularity  re­ flects  American  culture.  As  Fiddle  (24)  has  observed, the  amphetamine  user  is  a  caricature  of  many  widely 

admired  American  traits:  intense  activity,  efficiency, persistence  and  drive,  and  the  desire  to  excel,  to 

break  records,  and  to  move  with  ever  greater  speed. These  are  admirable  behavior  patterns  that  are  not easily  relinquished,  even  when  a  drug  may  be  re­ quired to achieve them.

The  result  is  the  perpetuation  of  the  legal  use  of dangerous  agents  of  little  therapeutic  advantage.  This is  not  the  first  description  of  the  hazards  or  of  the 

minimal  effectiveness  of  these  drugs,  nor  is  it  the  first effort  to  suggest  that  their  medical  use  be  curtailed 

(25-27). But the problem grows.

To  some  extent  the  current  drug-abuse  epidemic may  relate  to  the  way  we  as  physicians  have  handled the  amphetamine  problem.  Our  use  of  the  drug  may 

be  providing  a  poor  model  for  children  and  adoles­ cents  to  emulate.  By  treating  with  drugs  a  condition such  as  obesity,  which  probably  most  often  has  its 

roots  in  social  custom  and  psychological  conflict,  are 

we  giving  license  by  example  to  youngsters  who 

would  treat  their  own  social  and  psychological  dis­

comforts pharmacologically?

The  time  to  face  the  unpleasant  facts  is  long  over­

due.  Amphetamines  are  fascinating  substances  with 

a  wide  range  of  effects—some  good,  some  bad.  Their 

use  represents  a  sincere  effort  to  treat  major  causes  of 

human  suffering.  At  present,  however,  we  are  not  in 

a  position  to  handle  them  safely.  The  situation  raises 

uncomfortable  questions:  If  amphetamine  use  of  all 

types—legal  and  illegal—were  to  cease  completely tomorrow,  would  we  be  better  or  worse  off  with  re­

gard  to  health  than  we  are  today?  Do  we  really  need these drugs?

We  must  begin  taking  steps  now  to  end  the  epi­ demic  overuse  and  misuse  of  amphetamines.  Few  of us  would  welcome  more  restrictive  legislation  in  the drug  field  or  more  extensive  activity  by  the  Food  and 

Drug  Administration.  Yet  this  is  the  prospect  if  we avoid taking immediate remedial action.

This  action  should  begin  with  the  physician’s  vol­ untary  cessation  or  sharp  reduction  of  prescriptions for  amphetamines  and  their  congeners.  Exception might be granted in individual cases for the treatment

of  narcolepsy  and  hyperkinetic  reactions  of  children but  rarely  in  other  conditions.  It  is  difficult,  if  not  im­ possible,  to  justify  their  continued  use  in  obesity  and depression.  Physicians  may  need  a  buffer  against pressures  for  continued  prescriptions  from  some  pa­ tients.  If  so,  a  medical  committee  or  board  could  be established  to  authorize  these  exceptions,  as  in  Swe­ den  (28).  To  circumvent  the  weariness  most  of  us feel  toward  more  committee  work  and  the  suspicion that  an  endless  list  of  drugs  may  later  come  under such  scrutiny,  let  me  suggest  that  it  is  no  more  than we  would  do  if  heroin  were  made  legal.  Ampheta­ mines are no less a menace. Severe  curtailment  of  production  is  essential.  Less than  1  %  of  the  current  volume  would  probably  be an  adequate  supply  for  the  exceptional  case.  No  more than  two  pharmaceutical  houses  are  needed  to  pro­ vide  this  amount.  The  industry’s  voluntary  action toward  this  goal  would  provide  refreshing  evidence that  it  puts  the  public  welfare  first  and  that  legislation is  not  required  on  every  urgent  health  matter.  Finally, advertising  of  these  products  in  medical  journals  is inappropriate. We  need  not  delude  ourselves  that  these  measures will  end  amphetamine  abuse:  they  will  not.  It  is  not certain  they  will  even  reduce  it  measurably  for  several years.  Black-market  production  will  doubtlessly  ex­ pand.  The  diagnosis  of  narcolepsy  may  suddenly  be­ come  more  popular.  These  measures  are,  however,  a step  in  the  direction  of  removing  one  major  inconsist­ ency  in  our  approach  to  drugs  and  of  establishing  a climate  that  does  not  so  vigorously  promote  drug abuse. **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:  Received  18  November  1970;  re­**
