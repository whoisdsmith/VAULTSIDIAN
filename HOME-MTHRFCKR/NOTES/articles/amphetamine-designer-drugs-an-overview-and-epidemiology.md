**1.  Historical background**

The  term  ‘designer  drugs’  includes  compounds that  have  been  chemically  altered  from  federally controlled  substances,  to  produce  special  effects and  to  bypass  legal  regulations.  Designer  drugs are  mainly  synthesised  by  so-called  ‘underground’ laboratories.  Addiction  and  numerous  deaths have  been  reported  as  a  result  of  designer  drug use.  The  largest  group,  representing  the  most extensively  studied,  is  the  methylenedioxy-deriva­

Amphetamine designer drugs - an overview and 

The  methylenedioxy-derivatives  of  amphetamine  and  methamphetamine  represent  the  largest  group  of  designer drugs.  The  most  frequently  used  compounds  are  3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine  (MDMA-ecstasy)  and 

3,4-methylenedioxy-amphetamine  (MDA),  first  synthesised  in  1910  (MDA)  and  1914  (MDMA),  respectively,  to  be used  as  an  appetite  suppressant.  At  the  end  of  the  1960s,  non-medical  (recreational)  use  appeared  in  the  USA,  and in  the  middle  of  the  1980s  in  Europe.  In  Norway,  MDMA  and  related  compounds  have  been  detected  in  forensic 

samples  since  the  early  1990s.  In  order  to  bypass  the  legal  regulations  and  to  produce  more  potent  substances,  a number  of  related  compounds  have  been  synthesised,  including  derivatives  with  one  or  more  substituents  (methoxy, methyl,  halogen  or  sulphur),  attached  at  different  positions  to  the  phenylring  of  amphetamine  or  methamphetamine. A  report  from  1998  shows  that  0.5-3%  of  the  adult  European  population,  mainly  young  people,  has  used  ecstasy. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

tives of  amphetamine and  methamphetamine. One 

well-known  and  probably  the  most  used  com­

pound  belonging  to  this  group  is  3,4-methylene-

dioxy-methamphetamine  (MDMA),  or  mostly 

known  as  ecstasy  (Fig.  1).  MDMA  was  first  syn­

thesised  and  patented  by  Merck  in  1914,  with  the 

purpose o f  being used  for  appetite  control  (Down­

ing, 1986).  However, the  patent expired  due to  the 

lack  of  commercial  interest  and  MDMA  did  not 

become  available  on  the  public  market.  Except  for 

several  toxicological  animal  studies  with  MDMA 

at  the  beginning  of  the  1950s,  the  compound 

remained  relatively  ignored  until  1968,  when  non­

medical  use  first  appeared  in  the  USA  (Siegel, 

1986). Around 1980, small doses of MDMA were

used  legally  as  an  adjunct  to  psychotherapy. Dur­ ing  the  1970s,  MDMA  was  widely  abused throughout  the  USA  under  a  variety  of  street names:  XTC,  Adam,  MDM,  M  and  M  and  sev­ eral  others.  In  the  middle  of  the  1980s,  a  large number  of  clandestine  laboratories  provided  the distribution  of  MDMA  and  other  similar  designer

drugs  to  the  US  market.  At  this  time,  the  Eu­

ropean distribution was at its planning stage.

Another  early  known,  and  later  frequently 

used,  designer  drug,  is  3,4-methylenedioxyam-

phetamine  (MDA),  differing  from  MDMA  by  one 

methyl  group.  This  compound  was  first  synthe­

sised in 1910 (Poklis et al., 1979) (Fig. 1). How-

ever,  the  first  pharmacological  studies  demon­

strating  stimulatory  properties,  were  not  con­ ducted  until  1939  (Poklis  et  al.,  1979).  MDA  was patented in  1940 as  an antitussivum,  in the  begin­ ning  of  the  1960s  both  as  an  ataractic  and  an anorexigenic  drug.  However,  the  drug  has  never been  available  commercially  on  the  licit  pharma­ ceutical  market.  Around  1970,  widespread  abuse 

of  MDA  started,  followed  by  reports  of  several deaths  from  California  and  Canada.  A  common 

street name used for this drug is the ‘love drug’.

Due  to  their  addictive  potential,  in  addition  to extensive reports of  misuse and overdoses,  the US Department  of  Justice’s  Drug  Enforcement Agency  (DEA)  placed  MDMA  and  related derivatives  with  stimulant  properties  on  the  list  of psychotropic  substances  under  international  con­ trol,  schedule  I.  The  necessity  for  this  restriction was  endorsed,  but  some  disagreement  appeared, connected  to  research  and  potential  medical  ther­ apeutic prescription.

After  1986,  a  large  number  of  derivatives  from 

MDMA  and  MDA  have  been  synthesised  by clandestine  laboratories,  mainly  to  produce  more potent  drugs  and  to  bypass  these  legal  regula­ tions.  Up  until  these  days,  nearly  200  different derivatives  have  been  synthesised  and  described, mainly  by  underground  literature  (Shulgin  and 

Shulgin,  1995).  Examples  are  derivatives  with  one 

or  two  methoxy  groups  connected  to  the  phenylring,  with  halogens,  sulphur,  methyl  groups  and phosphor,  in  addition  to  different  substituents  in the  ethylamine  side  chain,  attached  at  different positions  against  each  other.  Only  a  limited  num­ ber  of  these  derivatives  are  known  from  Europe, although  both  halogen-  and  sulphur-derivatives have  been  detected  in  confiscated  tablets  or  bio­ logical  samples.  In  Norway,  six  to  seven  different derivatives have been detected.  Fig. 1 shows some examples  of  designer  drugs  with  different  sub­

stituents. The  term ecstasy  is also  often used  as a common  name  for  several  compounds  belonging to this class of drugs.

**2.  Detection in biological samples**

Due  to  the  chemical  relationship  with  am­

phetamine and  methamphetamine, the  presence of 

MDMA  and  related  compounds  can  be  detected 

in  biological  samples  by  immunogical  methods 

designed for  amphetamine/methamphetamine, de­

pending  on  the  concentrations  and  the  type  of  the 

respective  designer  drugs.  The  assay  sensitivity  is 

mostly  lower  than  the  amphetamine/metham­

phetamine,  and  not  all  different  drugs  belonging 

to  this  class  have  been  tested.  To  identify  and 

confirm  the  type  of  drugs  which  have  been  used, 

and  to  separate  similar  chemical  compounds,  a 

specific  analytical  method  (gas-chromatography/ 

mass-spectrometry; GC/MS) has to be used.

**3.  Epidemiology**

The  real  number  of  persons  who  have  used 

amphetamine  designer  drugs  at  any  time,  or  more 

regularly,  is  not  known.  The  frequencies  of  such 

use  are  mainly  known  from  anonymous  question­

naire  studies  of  drug  use  among  large  selected 

groups.  Various  estimates  have  been  given,  de­

pending  on  the  age  group  studies.  The  frequency 

of  amphetamine-derived  designer  drugs  detected 

in  forensic  samples,  may  also  indicate  the  extent 

of  such  drug  use  compared  to  other  illegal  drugs. 

The  use  of  amphetamine  designer  drugs  has 

mostly  been  reported  to  occur  among  young  peo­

ple  (15-25  years),  in  particular  associated  with 

clubs, raves  and house  parties. The  ‘rave scene’ in 

particular appears  to be  responsible for  the explo­

sive  growth  of  MDMA  use  in  the  UK,  which  has 

been  described  as  developing  into  what  many 

believe  is  the  ‘largest  youth  movement  in  British 

history’ (Beck, 1993).

A  study  from  the  beginning  of  the  1980s, 

showed  that  39%  of  the  questioned  students  at 

Stanford  University,  USA,  had  used  MDMA  at 

least  once  (Peroutka,  1987).  However,  according 

to  a  1993  National  Institute  on  Drug  Abuse  sur­

vey,  2%  of  all  US  college  students  admitted  hav­

ing  used  MDMA  in  the  previous  12  months 

(NIDA  capsules,  CAP  16,  1993).  A  questionnaire 

study among  students («  = 3050)  selected from  10 

different  universities  in  the  UK,  showed  that  13% 

had  used  ecstasy  once  or  regularly  (Webb  et  al., 

1996). However, the most frequently used drugs

were  cannabis  (59%),  amphetamines  (19%),  co­ caine  (18%)  and  LSD  (18%).  The  frequencies  of drug use were higher among males compared to

females  and  were  also  dependent  of  the  ethnic 

origin of the students.

Based  on  the  ‘Annual  report  on  the  state  of the  drug  problems  in  the  European  Union’,  pub­ lished  by  the  European  Monitoring  Centre  for Drugs  and  Drugs  Addition  (EMCDDA,  1998), 0.5-3%  of  the  adult  population  within  the  EU has  used  ecstasy.  The  highest  frequencies  of  ec­

stasy  use  among  15-16-year-old  school  students has  been  reported  from  Ireland  (9%),  the Netherlands  (8.1%)  and  the  UK  (8%)  (EM­ CDDA,  1998).  In  some  countries,  the  use  of ecstasy  is  reported  to  be  increasing.  Deaths caused  by  ecstasy  are  few  in  numbers  compared to  other  drugs,  e.g.  to  heroin.  The  use  of  am­ phetamine  designer  drugs  is  often  combined  with 

other  drugs.  The  doses  in  tablets  containing 

MDMA  vary  from  50  to  200  mg;  most  com­ monly  they  contain  100  mg.  However,  analyses 

of  confiscated  designer  drug  tablets  have  often documented a mixture with other drugs.

In  Norway,  MDMA  and  MDA  and  similar compounds  have  been  detected  in  forensic  sam­ ples  since  the  early  1990s,  increasing  steadily  up to  1998  (Fig.  2).  The  positive  samples  represent mainly  cases  of  criminal  offences  connected  to driving  under  the  influence  of  drugs,  illegal  drug use,  autopsy  cases  (without  the  drug  being  the main  cause  of  death)  and  control  of  prison  in­ mates.  However,  the  number  of  designer  drug detections  is  low,  compared  to  other  illegal  drugs 

(e.g.  cannabis,  amphetamines,  heroin).  The  fre­ quency  of  designer  drug  detections  in  forensic cases  may  be  non-representative  compared  to real  use,  due  to  the  fact  that  such  drugs  are mainly  used  in  closed  parties  and  less  in  connec­ tion  with  criminal  offences.  A  questionnaire 

study  from  1998,  performed  by  the  National  In­

stitute  of  Alcohol  and  Drugs  Research  in  Nor­ way,  showed  that  4.8%  of  young  people  (15-20 years)  from  the  capital  Oslo  had  used  ecstasy 

once  or  more,  while  the  frequency  from  the whole  country  was  2.5%  (Fig.  3)  (Alcohol  and Drugs  in  Norway,  1998).  The  use  of  ecstasy  was 

significantly  lower  compared  to  cannabis  (25%  in Oslo)  and  also  to  amphetamine  (8%  in  Oslo), but  higher  than  cocaine,  LSD  and  heroin  (Fig. 4).

**4.  Conclusions**

The  use  of  amphetamine  designer  drugs  seems to  be  increasing  in  some  countries,  mainly  among young people.  It may  be expected  that clandestine laboratories  may  produce  new  and  more  potent compounds,  by  introduction  of  ‘new’  chemical 

substituents  in  different  positions  of  the molecules.  This  problem  demands  matter-of-fact warnings  for  the  potential  user  groups,  to  avoid life-threatening  complications  and  fatal  intoxica­ tions.
