Adequate management and conservation of instream thermal habitats requires an understanding of the control that different landscape features exert on water temperatures. Previous studies have extensively explored the influence of spatial scale on these relationships. However, the effect of temporal scale remains poorly understood. Here, we use paired air–water mean daily and...

High-speed locomotion is an essential survival strategy for animals, allowing populating harsh and unpredictable environments. Bio-inspired soft robots equally benefit from versatile and ultrafast motion but require appropriate driving mechanisms and device designs. Here, we present a class of small-scale soft electromagnetic robots made of curved elastomeric bilayers, driven by...

Advances in machine learning (ML) have enabled the development of interatomic potentials that promise the accuracy of first principles methods and the low-cost, parallel efficiency of empirical potentials. However, ML-based potentials struggle to achieve transferability, i.e., provide consistent accuracy across configurations that differ from those used during training. In order...

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted disparities in healthcare, particularly in the United States, even though disparities have existed since the organization of the modern healthcare system. Recruitment of patients from racial and ethnic minority groups is often minimal in phase 3 clinical trials, and is further exacerbated in the case of trials for rare diseases such as...

The first-order phase transition between two tetrahedral networks of different density—introduced as a hypothesis to account for the anomalous behaviour of certain thermodynamic properties of deeply supercooled water—has received strong support from a growing body of work in recent years. Here we show that this liquid–liquid phase transition in tetrahedral networks can be...

Left–right asymmetries in the nervous system (lateralisation) influence a broad range of behaviours, from social responses to navigation and language.

The quality of this process corresponds to different relaxation phenomena, yet primarily it corresponds to minimized thermalization of photoexcited...

The effects of anonymity on utilization review has never been examined in the real world. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of removing anonymity protection for claims reviewers on their review decisions. Using a single-blinded repeated measures design, we randomly selected 1457 claims cases (with 12,237 orders) that had been anonymously reviewed and reimbursed in 2016 and...

In mammalian neonates, milk consumption provides nutrients, growth factors, immune molecules, and microbes. Milk microbiomes are increasingly recognized for their roles in seeding infant gut microbiomes and priming immune development. However, milk microbiome variation within and among individuals remains under investigation. We used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to investigate...

Honghua (Carthami flos) and Xihonghua (Croci stigma) have been used in anti-COVID-19 as Traditional Chinese Medicine, but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, we applied network pharmacology by analysis of active compounds and compound-targets networks, enzyme kinetics assay, signaling pathway analysis and investigated the potential mechanisms of anti-COVID-19. We found that...

Post-resuscitation hemodynamic level is associated with outcomes. This study was conducted to investigate if post-resuscitation diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is a favorable prognostic factor. Using TaIwan Network of Targeted Temperature ManagEment for CARDiac Arrest (TIMECARD) registry, we recruited adult patients who received targeted temperature management in nine medical...

Ash emission in explosive silicic eruptions can have widespread impacts for human health, agriculture, infrastructure, and aviation. Estimates of the total grainsize distribution (TGSD) generated during explosive magma fragmentation underpins eruption models and ash dispersal forecasts. Conventionally, the TGSD constrained via erupted deposits is assumed to match the TGSD...

Evidence from previous epidemiological studies on the effect of physical activity on the risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is conflicting. We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis to verify whether physical activity is causally associated with AD. This study used two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to estimate the association between physical...

As one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality, stroke and its recurrence has attracted more and more attention. Dl-3-n-butylphthalidle(NBP) has been widely used for treating acute ischemic stroke in China and shows a great clinical effect. NBP plays a role in different pathophysiological processes in the treatment of ischemic stroke, including antioxidants, anti...
