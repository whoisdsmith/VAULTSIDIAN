**Complete amphetamine synthese**

# This is everything you need for making P2NP, from left to right:

Pipette-aparatus,  several  pipettes,  dean&stark  trap,  PTFE  greas,  toluene,  measuring  cylinder 

100ml,  nitroethane,  benzaldehyde,  n-butylamine,  above  the  brown  flask  a  heating  mantle  and 

a 250ml RB-flask. The ratios you should use are lmol benzaldehyde and 1 mol nitroethane and 0,lmol R.-NH2. 

Converting mols to ml s you will find out that you will need:

SWIM didn t use 1 mol right away but first wanted to experiment with smaller amounts, so he 

used:

17ml benzaldehyde

13,3ml nitroethane

3,3ml n-butylamine

33ml toluene

Be sure that non of the products you use will contain water since when performing the reaction water will evolve which will be taken out of the reaction with the dean&stark trap because it prevents a good yield of P2NP.

After heating it a bit to get it at 100*C aprox.

A vague picture of how it looks like after 3 hours of refluxing, if the color will get orange to dark orange before 6 hours you should stop refluxing at that time.

But don t reflux it longer than 6 hours, sometimes you only need 3 hours though. To improve yield you can also add 1ml of glacial acetic acid to buffer the n-butylamine. 

For every mole of benzaldehyde one mole of water will form and since SWIM used 17ml of benzaldehyde which is ( 17ml x l,05g/ml = 17,85g benzaldehyde / 106,12g/mol = ) 0,17mol benzaldehyde. Thus 0,17 mol of water will form which is ( 0,17 x 18,01 = ) 3,03ml of water. So after the 6 hours or earlier you should have 3,03ml of water in your trap, it will likely be more since your toluene will contain a bit of water too in SWIMS reaction he got 4ml of water.

The color after 6 hours of refluxing and collecting 4ml of water in the trap.

Now SWIM  puts the  round botto m flask  in t he freezer  at 18*C  because the  P2NP is  now 

dissolved in  the toluene  but when  you will  make the  toluene very  cold the  P2NP won  t dissolve 

in the toluene anymore or at least very bad.

7 hours later scratched the walls of the RB flask to initiate crystal forming.

Crystals formed on the sides.

Now quickly break up the mass with a glass stir rod or a thermometer and throw the mixture threw a buchner filter (filtration under vacuum). The toluene will get back to room temperature and thus the crystals will dissolve back into the toluene that is why you need to be so quick and necesarilly do need to use a buchner filter.

Just a picture of the buchner filter how it looks like. 

Put the crystals on a paper to air-dry. As you can see the crystals are yellow coloured so they need purification or else your next 

product will be crap and yellow too. The first crop weighed 6,02 gram when completely dry. The second crop was 8,01gram SWIM evaporated off the half of the liquid and put it back in 

the fridge.

Now the crystals were purified by dissolving them in a minimal amount of boiling isopropylalcohol which is standing in a hot water bath, when they have all dissolved put a watch glass over the top of the erlenmyer and let them cool to room temperature; then put them in the deep freezer and vacuum filtrate them over a buchner filter and let them dry again.

P2NP dissolved in boiling IPA. Cooling down, you can see crystals forming

Here you can see the crystals forming while cooling down, in the buchner filter the crystals were washed with water. From the 14,03g of P2NP which SWIM started with 13,7g of P2NP was left over after the recrystalization/purification step.

Now it is time (by the mean time the P2NP is dry again ) to do the aminated reduction of the P2NP to amphetamine.freebase. This was first tested with 3,5g of P2NP: You will need 5g Al foil cut it into 1 (2,5cm) squares and then fold them up to nuggets and you should wrap them up so tight that you can only still press them a little with your fingers.

This is the reflux setup that SWIM will be using.  Close up and methanol added which

had 70mg of HgCl2 dissolved in it. As sayd above at the picture you will need a solvent like methanol and you dissolve HgCb 

inside the solvent and add it to the Aluminium make sure the aluminium is not too fine else a very heavy reaction will occur with the possibilty that mercury and hydrochloric acid, boiling 

methanol and hot aluminium will cover you like a vulcano. The HgCI2 can also be substituted by other Hg salts like Hg(NO3)2-

After  lOmin  average  the  Al  will  start  to  evolve  hydrogen  gas,  depending  on  thickness  of  the foil. If  you  use  thin  foil  wrap  it  up  3-4  layers  before  cuting  squares  out  of  it  else i t  will  react  too 

heavily.

The methanol will become gray/blue, and the aluminium will become less shiny. On for  hand you  should make  a solution  of your  P2NP that  will be  added to  the mixture  later on. The solvent used was isopropylalcohol and glacial acetic acid, in a ratio: 40ml IPA; 60ml GAA; 3,5g P2NP. You might need to heat it up because the P2NP will not dissolve easily at room temperature.

![amphetamine-synthese_10_27](Generated/images/amphetamine-synthese_10_27.png)

The reaction will heat up and when there are dark spots on the Al and there is hydrogen gas 

bubbling of it you can add all the P2NP solution at once to the AI+MeOH + HgCl2.

A little later in the progress, the mixture gets darker and heats up even more to a mild reflux.

By now the mixture is dark and the aluminium is dissolving slowely, you can notice small shiny pieces of aluminium floating around, extra heat is applied here because the Al was so big that it reacted not fast enough, but hey better slow reaction than a volcano, right.

Now when almost all the Al has dissolved add 200ml of cold water to the mixture to cool it down. Then basify it to pH 12 with 50g of NaOH dissolved in 150ml water. All the remaining Al will now react with the NaOH and form hydrogen gas and the mixture will heat up but not to a boil, that wouldn t matter though.

After an hour stirring there had been some foam and after an hour of stirring the mixture was still quite hot and all the Al dissolved now Time to extract your product. SWIM used ether since it has a very low boiling point so that comes in handy later on in the 

progress.

SWIM doesn t own a huge seperatory funnel so he put the mixture in the seperatory funnel in 

portions and added 30ml ether at a time aprox. and the ether is the upper clear layer (your amphetamine.freebase is dissolved in the ether now).

After all the washed this was collected in total. Anhydrous magnesiumsulfate was added to suck up the water in their molecules and thus drying the ether and your product. Now you only have to wait 12 hours to let the MgSO4 do its work, filtrate it and then you can let the ether evaporate off at room temperature or with the help of a warm lamp. NOT AN OPEN FLAME!!! Ether is very inflammable. All the ether was evaporated off and 50ml anhydrous IPA was added to the amphetamine.freebase. Then to anhydrous IPA 98% sulfuric acid was added calculate how many mol amphetamine freebase you ve got and then take 90% of that and calculate how many mols of H2SO4 that represents and add that to 15ml of anhydrous IPA. Now drip H2SO4+IPA mix into the freebase which is dissolved in the IPA. Here you can see the crystals forming after a few drops have been added.

Glass full of crystals. It wasn t that much though but it looks like it is full of crystals.

And finally pure amphetamine sulfate has been obtained this was around 180mg. When only starting with 3,5g P2NP, when you loose lg in the filter that is a lot, with bigger amounts yields are better anyway.
