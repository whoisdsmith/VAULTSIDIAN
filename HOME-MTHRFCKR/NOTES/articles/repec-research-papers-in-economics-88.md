## General principles

RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) is an initiative that seeks to enhance the dissemination of research in Economics and related areas. We want to make research more accessible both for the authors and the readers. RePEc is a crowd-sourced effort: a) thousands of people and organizations contribute the underlying data, b) a core team of contributors manage the system, and c) sponsor organizations provide the infrastructure. As such, the RePEc initiative has no central expenses, and thus can provide all services for free to all users.

### How RePEc operates:

Every publisher or provider puts text files describing their publications on their server. These files follow a simple but rigorous machine-readable syntax. They can then be automatically mirrored and made available to the public on the various RePEc websites. Some RePEc services complement these data with additional information such as citations or author details. RePEc is thus a facilitator that organizes the data for others to use.

### How you can use RePEc as a provider or publisher:

Join over 2000 providers and publishers to increase the visibility of your publications. Follow these [step-by-step instructions](https://ideas.repec.org/stepbystep.html) to create your RePEc archive. They show how to quickly set up your RePEc archive on your http, https, or ftp server and describe the syntax of the required metadata for working papers, journal articles, books, chapters, and software. For the complete technical details on the infrastructure and the metadata, you can also read about the [Guildford Protocol](https://ideas.repec.org/p/rpc/rdfdoc/guildp.html) and [ReDIF](https://ideas.repec.org/p/rpc/rdfdoc/redif.html), the Research Documents Information Format.

### How you can use RePEc as a reader:

You can explore economic literature on two RePEc services. On [EconPapers](http://econpapers.repec.org/) and [IDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/), search and browse, or follow links to author profiles, references, citations, keywords, or classifications. You can get notifications of new material with two other RePEc services, [NEP](http://nep.repec.org/) and [MyIDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/cgi-bin/myideas.cgi).

### How you can use RePEc as an author:

With the [RePEc Author Service](https://authors.repec.org/), you can create a profile of your indexed works. This allows the other RePEc services to link your profile to your works and vice versa. You also get notifications about the visibility of your works and citations newly found by [CitEc](http://citec.repec.org/). And if your publisher does not participate in RePEc, you can upload missing items to [MPRA](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/), copyright permitting.

### How you can use RePEc as an institution:

RePEc can help you make your working papers (pre-prints) more visible, track how your researchers publish, and provide metrics to evaluate impact.

### How you can leverage RePEc data as a researcher:

Data assembled by RePEc can be used for many purposes. Examples are academic research, tracking how working papers get published, adding metrics to a website, and evaluating researchers or institutions. We have instructions on how to access the data, including through an API.

There is much more that RePEc can do for you. Below is a list of all the RePEc services:

## RePEc services

The following are services that use ([principle](http://repec.org/docs/RePEcDataUse.html)) and contribute RePEc data. They also report usage statistics that can be used towards the RePEc [rankings](https://ideas.repec.org/top/).

Authors in institutions lacking a participating RePEc archive can submit their papers to MPRA and get them included in the RePEc database.

## Additional websites using RePEc

The RePEc bibliographic data is in the public domain and thus used by other services as well. The following are the ones we know of, and unfortunately none report usage statistics back to [LogEc](http://logec.repec.org/).

-   [EconLit](http://econlit.org/)
-   [EconStor](http://www.econstor.eu/)
-   [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/)
-   [Inomics](http://www.inomics.com/economics/repec-article-search)
-   [Microsoft Academic Search](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/)
-   [OAISter/WORLDCAT](http://oaister.worldcat.org/)
-   [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu/)
-   [ResearchGate](http://www.researchgate.net/)
-   [Sciverse](http://www.sciverse.com/)
-   [EBSCO](https://www.ebscohost.com/)

Over 2,200 archives from [103 countries](http://repec.org/docs/RePEC_co.html) have contributed about 4.2 million research items from 3,800 journals and 5,500 working paper series. Over 65,000 authors have registered and 75,000 email subscriptions are served every week.

## Volunteers

RePEc is entirely based on the contributions of volunteers: Maintainers of RePEc archives, editors at [NEP](http://nep.repec.org/) and [MPRA](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/), and [those who run](https://ideas.repec.org/team.html) the various RePEc services. If you want to get involved check out our [volunteer opportunities](https://ideas.repec.org/volunteers.html) or contact any member of the [RePEc team](https://ideas.repec.org/team.html).

The [ArchEc](http://archec.repec.org/) project provides long-term archiving of RePEc templates and full-text files, with the support of the [Fondation Banque de France](https://fondation.banque-france.fr/).

RePEc emerged from the [NetEc group](http://netec.mcc.ac.uk/), created in 1992, which received support for its WoPEc project between 1996-1999 by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils, as part of its Electronic Libraries Programme (eLib). RePEc was created in June 1997 to decentralize the work done by WoPEc and thus make it independent of grant needs. RePEc is then guaranteed to remain free for all parties.  

## Contacts

Each RePEc service has contact details; for any question, please email them. For general enquiries about RePEc, in particular to [open a RePEc archive](https://ideas.repec.org/stepbystep.html), contact [Kit Baum](mailto:repec@repec.org) or [Christian Zimmermann](mailto:zimmermann@stlouisfed.org).
