# **Mixed Amphetamine Salts Extended-**

# **Release in the Treatment of Adult**

# **ADHD:** **A Randomized, Controlled Trial**

# By  Richard  H.  Weisler,  MD,  Joseph  Biederman,  MD,  Thomas  J.  Spencer,  MD,  Timothy  E. 

# Wilens,  MD,  Stephen  V.  Faraone,  PhD,  Allan  K.  Chrisman,  MD,  Stephanie  C.  Read,  MS, 

# and Simon J. Tulloch, MD, on behalf of the SLI381.303 Study Group

### **ABSTRACT**

# **Introduction:** Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder  (ADHD)  is  a  serious  neurobehavioral disorder  of  childhood  onset  that  often  persists 

# into  adolescence  and  adulthood.  Functional 

# impairments,  underachievement,  and  difficult 

# interpersonal  relationships  illustrate  the  need  for effective treatment of ADHD through adulthood.

# **Method:This** prospective,  multisite,  ran­ domized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 

# parallel-group,  dose-escalation  study  was conducted  to  assess  the  efficacy,  safety,  and duration  of  action  of  mixed  amphetamine salts  extended-release  (MAS  XR)  in  adults with  ADHD,  combined  type.  Adults  >18  years of  age  were  given  placebo  or  MAS  XR  20, 40,  or  60  mg/day  for  4  weeks.The  main  out­ come  measures  were  the  ADHD  Rating  Scale and  Conners'  Adult  ADHD  Rating  Scale  Short Version Self-Report (CAARS-S-S).

### **FOCUS POINTS____________________**

# •  Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD) 

# is  a  serious  neurobehavioral  disorder  of  child­

# hood onset that often persists into adulthood.

# •  Stimulants  have  been  studied  extensively  in 

# children  with  ADHD  and  have  a  well-estab­

# lished safety and efficacy profile.

# •  Stimulants  are  indirect  agonists  of  catechol-

# aminergic  transmission  in  the  central  nervous 

# system  and  increase  the  amount  of  dopamine 

# and norepinephrine available presynaptically.

# •  In this  study, mixed  amphetamine salts  extended-

# release  (MAS  XR)  20-60  mg/day  were  safe  and 

# effective in adults with ADHD.

# •  Treatment  response  to  MAS  XR  was  related  to 

# ADHD  symptom  severity  and  a  trend  toward 

# dose  response  for  efficacy  was  observed  for 

# adults with higher baseline symptom severity.

# •  MAS XR seems  to have an  acceptable cardiovas­

# cular safety profile in adults with ADHD.

# **Results:** Two  hundred  fifty-five  subjects  were 

# randomly  assigned  to  treatment  with  MAS  XR  or 

# placebo.  MAS  XR  treatment  was  associated  with

# statistically  and  clinically  significant  ADHD  symp­ tom  reduction  at  endpoint;  mean  ADHD  Rating Scale  scores  were  18.5  for  the  20-mg  group (P=.OO1),  18.4  for  the  40-mg  group  (P<.001),  and 18.5  for  the  60-mg  group  (Pc.001).  Adults  with severe  symptoms  (ADHD  Rating  Scale  score  >32 at  baseline)  had  significantly  greater  symptom reduction  with  the  highest  MAS  XR  dose  (60 mg/day),  however,  this  dose-response  relation­ ship  was  determined  by  post-hoc  analysis.The mean  MAS  XR  effect  size  was  0.8.  Statistically significant  (Pc.05)  improvements  in  CAARS-S-S ADHD  index  scores  occurred  at  4-  and  12-hours postdose  for  all  MAS  XR  groups,  indicating  a 12-hour  duration  of  effect.  Symptoms  improved within  the  first  treatment  week.  Most  adverse events  reported  were  mild  or  moderate  in  inten­ sity,  and  the  most  commonly  reported  adverse events  were  consistent  with  the  known  profile of  stimulant  medications.  Vital  signs  and  elec­ trocardiograms  showed  no  clinically  significant cardiovascular changes. **Conclusion:**These  results  suggest  that  MAS XR  is  safe  and  effective  in  adults  with  ADHD  and controlled ADHD symptoms for up to 12 hours.

# **INTRODUCTION_______________________** Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder (ADHD)  is  a  serious  neurobehavioral  disorder of  childhood  onset  that  often  persists  into  ado­ lescence  and  adulthood.  Estimates  of  the  preva­ lence  and  persistence  of  ADHD  vary  depending on  the  diagnostic  criteria  used  and  definitions  of persistence.1  Based  on Diagnostic  and  Statistical Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fourth  Edition,  Text Revision  (DSM-IV-TR)  criteria,2  -10%  of  schoolaged  youth  worldwide  are  affected  by  ADHD3 

# 5   and  4.4%  of  adults  in  the  United  States  have ADHD.6  With  209  million  adults  >18  years  of  age and  a  4.4%  prevalence  rate,  >9  million  adults  in the US may have ADHD.7

# Faraone  and  colleagues8  surveyed  primary care  and  psychiatry  practices  to  determine 

# whether  patterns  of  diagnosis  and  treatment  of 

# adult  ADHD  differ.  Only  25%  of  the  patients  with ADHD  were  first  diagnosed  in  childhood  or  ado­

# lescence.  Although  ADHD  is  a  chronic  disorder, 

# many  individuals  are  able  to  compensate  until the  challenges  of  family  and  career  become overwhelming.  In  the  Faraone  and  colleagues8 study,  >90%  of  adults  with  undiagnosed  ADHD were  self-referred,  both  in  primary  care  and 

# psychiatric  settings,  and  common  symptoms that  motivated  self-referral  were  general  disor­

# ganization,  problems  with  time  management,  a tendency  to  leave  projects  incomplete,  and  dif­ ficulty  functioning  at  work.  Greater  than  50%  of 

# previously  undiagnosed  adults  had  complained about  ADHD  symptoms  to  other  healthcare 

# professionals  in  the  past.  Unlike  the  standard of  care  in  pediatrics,  adults  are  not  routinely screened  for  ADHD  in  primary  care.  Lack  of training  and  uncertainty  about  the  diagnosis 

# likely  contribute  to  the  underrecognition  of  the disorder in adults.

# Clinical,  family,  psychopharmacologic,  neu-

# robiologic,  neuropsychological,  and  outcome studies  support  the  validity  of  adult  ADHD.9 

# Neuroimaging  studies1011  indicate  a  profile  of prefrontal  dopaminergic  hypoactivity  in  both adult  and  childhood  ADHD.  The  core  symptoms of  ADHD  —inattentiveness,  impulsivity,  and hyperactivity  —are  well  documented  in  adult ADHD,  although  hyperactivity  symptoms  tend  to diminish  with  age.1213  Similar  functional  impair­ ments,  such  as  educational  or  occupational underachievement  and  difficult  interpersonal relationships,  affect  both  children  and  adults with  ADHD.1416  Compared  with  age-  and  gen­ der-matched  individuals,  teenagers  and  young adults  with  ADHD  are  >4  times  as  likely  to  have automobile  accidents.17  Significantly  fewer adults  with  ADHD  had  attended  college,  twice  as many  had  been  divorced,  and  half  as  many  were completely  satisfied  with  their  professional  lives and  career  tracks.16  These  life  impairments  illus­ trate  the  need  for  effective  treatment  of  ADHD throughout the lifespan.

# Stimulant  medications  have  been  studied extensively  in  children  with  ADHD  and  have a  well-established  safety  and  efficacy  pro­ file.  Research  suggests  that  adults  with  ADHD respond  well  to  stimulants  when  adequate  doses are  used.1819  A  number  of  once-daily  extendedrelease  (XR)  stimulant  formulations  have  been developed  recently  and  are  likely  to  increase

# pharmacokinetic  profile  for  MAS  XR  20  mg,  40 

# mg,  and  60  mg/day  has  been  demonstrated 

# in  healthy  adults.26This  randomized,  double­ blind,  placebo-controlled,  forced-dose-escalation  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  efficacy and  safety  of  MAS  XR  20,  40,  and  60  mg/day  in 

# adults  with  ADHD.  We  hypothesized  that  MAS XR  would  reduce  ADHD  symptoms  significantly 

# in  adults  and  that  higher  doses  would  lead  to greater symptom improvement.

### **METHODS**

# **Subjects and Eligibility Criteria**

# Subjects  were  outpatients  >18  years  of  age who  were  referred  by  clinics  and  had  a  primary diagnosis  of  ADHD  established  by  psychiatric evaluation  using DSM-IV-TR  criteria.2  Diagnosis 

# required  identification  of  at  least  six  of  nine symptoms  for  hyperactive/impulsive  and  inat­ tentive  subtype  criteria  and  ADHD  onset  by 7  years  of  age.  Subjects  were  in  good  physi­ cal  health,  with  normal  vital  signs  and  12-lead electrocardiogram  (ECG)  measurements.This study  complied  with  institutional  review  board 

# regulations  and  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki, 2000  revision.  Each  subject  provided  written, 

# informed  consent  after  study  procedures  and objectives were disclosed.

# Subjects  incapable  of  following  study  instruc­ tions  or  having  an  intelligence  quotient  <80 (Kaufman  Brief  Intelligence  Test)  were  excluded from  the  study.  Several  comorbid  psychiatric diagnoses  were  excluded:  psychosis,  bipolar  ill­

# ness,  pervasive  developmental  disorder,  severe obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  and  severe depressive  (17-item  Hamilton  Rating  Scale  for Depression score >19) and anxiety disorders

# (14-item  Hamilton  Rating  Scale  for  Anxiety 

# score  >17).  Subjects  were  excluded  for  a  posi­

# tive  drug  screen  or  substance  abuse  history  (or 

# living  with  someone  with  a  substance  abuse 

# disorder);  glaucoma;  hyperthyroidism;  seizure, 

# tic  disorder,  orTourette  syndrome;  and  preg­

# nancy  or  lactation.  Also  excluded  were  subjects 

# who  were  taking  within  30  days  of  the  screen­

# ing  visit  any  anticonvulsant  drugs,  clonidine, 

# guanfacine,  systemic  steroids,  medications  that 

# affect  blood  pressure  (BP)  or  the  heart  or  have 

# central  nervous  system  effects,  pemoline,  or 

# investigational drugs.

# **Study Design**

# This  was  a  multisite,  randomized,  double­

# blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group  study 

# designed  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 

# three  doses  of  MAS  XR  in  adults  with  ADHD. 

# The  study  was  conducted  between  February  6, 

# 2002,  and  May  24,  2002.  Eligible  subjects  were 

# randomly  assigned  (3  active:1  placebo)  to  a  daily 

# morning  dose  of  MAS  XR  20  mg,  40  mg,  or  60 

# mg  for  4  weeks  (Figure  1).This  was  a  forced-

# dose-escalation  design  and  dosage  modification 

# was  not  permitted;  subjects  were  excluded  if 

# sustained drug intolerance occurred.

# **Measurements**

# **Primary Efficacy Assessments**

# Investigators  completed  the  ADHD  Rating 

# Scale  to  assess  the  18  individual  symptom  cri­

# teria  of  ADHD  in DSM-IV-TR  at  baseline  and 

# at  each  clinic  visit.  The  ADHD  Rating  Scale  is 

# composed  of  two  subscales,  inattentive  and 

# hyperactive/impulsive;  all  items  were  scored 

# on  a  4-point  scale  from  0  (no  symptoms)  to  3 

# (severe symptoms).

# **Secondary Efficacy Assessments**

# Conners'  Adult  ADHD  Rating  Scale-Short 

# Version-Self-Report  (CAARS-S-S)  was  used  to 

# determine  the  duration  of  MAS  XR  action.  Each 

# item  was  scored  on  a  4-point  scale,  from  0  (not 

# at  all,  never)  to  3  (very  much,  very  frequently). The  five  CAARS-S-S  subscales  include  the  12-

# item  ADHD  index  and  4-factor-derived,  5-item scales.  The  CAARS-S-S  ADHD  index  measures the  overall  level  of  ADHD-related  symptoms 

# using  items  that  capture  daily  symptomatology, such  as  "I  have  a  short  fuse/hot  temper,"  "I  am 

# always  on  the  go,”  "I  feel  restless  even  when sitting  still,"  and  "Things  I  hear  or  see  distract 

# me  from  what  I'm  doing."  Using  an  interactive voice-response  system,  subjects  completed  the 

# CAARS-S-S  at  4-  and  12-hours  postdose  3  days/ week  during  the  washout  week  and  each  of  the 4 treatment weeks.

# The  Clinical  Global  Impressions-Severity (CGI-S),  -Improvement  (CGI-I),  and  -Efficacy 

# (CGI-E)  scales  were  used  to  determine  overall 

# improvement  over  time.  The  CGI-S  is  a  crosssectional  assessment  of  the  severity  of  illness using  a  7-point  scale  and  was  assessed  at  base­

# line  and  end  point.The  CGI-I  (also  a  7-point scale)  provides  a  longitudinal  assessment  of overall  symptom  improvement  relative  to  base­

# line  and  was  measured  weekly  during  the  4 treatment  weeks.  Investigators  also  completed the  CGI-E  weekly.  The  CGI-E  consists  of  two 

# items  (Therapeutic  Effects  and  Side  Effects), each  of  which  is  a  4-point  scale  intended  spe­ cifically to capture medication effects.

# **Safety Assessments**

# Safety  was  assessed  through  physical  exami­ nation,  neurologic  evaluation,  vital  sign  mea­ surements,  and  clinical  laboratory  test  results.  A 

# 12-lead  ECG,  performed  at  baseline  and  2-week intervals,  was  evaluated  for  safety  by  the  inves­ tigator  but  was  analyzed  for  ECG  measures  by a  central  laboratory.  Spontaneously  reported 

# adverse  events  (AEs)  were  recorded  weekly  using 

# Coding  Symbols  for  a  Thesaurus  of  Adverse 

# Reaction Terms (COSTART)27 terminology.

# **Statistical Analysis**

# **Determination of Sample Size**

# An  enrollment  of  200  subjects  was  required 

# to  detect  a  standardized  treatment  difference  of 

# 0.60  between  any  MAS  XR  group  and  the  pla­

# cebo  group  at  80%  power  (type  I  error=.05)  using 

# a 2-sided t-test.

# **Randomization**

# Eligible  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to 

# one  of  the  four  double-blind  treatment  groups 

# (MAS  XR  20,  40,  or  60  mg/day  or  placebo)  in  a 

# 1:1:1:1  ratio  using  a  block  randomization  sched­

# ule.  Each  site  initially  received  treatment  kits  in 

# two  complete  blocks  (eg,  eight  pre-numbered 

# drug  kits);  additional  kits  were  provided  in  com­

# plete  blocks  as  needed.The  clinical  study  coordi­

# nator  at  each  site  assigned  eligible  subjects  the 

# next  available  randomization  number  in  ascend­

# ing  order.  Statistical  tests  were  completed  to 

# determine  whether  the  counts  (Cochran-Mantel-

# Haenszel  [CMH]  test)  and  means  (F  test)  for 

# demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  were 

# similar across treatment groups.

# Analyses  were  performed  using  SAS  statisti­

# cal  software,  version  6.12  or  higher.28  Efficacy 

# results  were  analyzed  on  the  intent-to-treat 

# (ITT)  sample  (all  subjects  assigned  to  treatment 

# with  at  least  one  valid  post-baseline  ADHD 

# Rating  Scale  total  score).  Safety  results  were 

# analyzed  for  all  subjects  assigned  to  treatment. 

# For  all  measures,  the  endpoint  was  defined  as 

# the  last  valid  postbaseline  observation  (numer­

# ically  equivalent  to  a  last  observation-carried 

# forward analysis).

# **Primary Efficacy Analysis**

# For  the  ADHD  Rating  Scale  total  score  at  end­

# point,  an  analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  was 

# performed,  with  treatment  and  site  as  fixed 

# effects  and  the  baseline  score  as  a  covariate. 

# Dunnett's  test  was  used  to  compare  each  active 

# treatment  group  with  placebo  if  an  overall 

# treatment  effect  was  detected.This  model  was 

# also  applied  to  ADHD  Rating  Scale  total  scores 

# at  each  treatment  week  and  the  ADHD  Rating 

# Scale  subscale  scores  at  endpoint.  Effect  size 

# for  the  ADHD  Rating  Scale  total  score  at  end­

# point  was  calculated  as  the  mean  treatment  dif­

# ference  for  MAS  XR  versus  placebo  divided  by 

# the pooled standard deviation.

Original Research

# **Secondary Efficacy Analyses** Endpoint  CAARS-S-S  ADHD  index  scores were  analyzed  using  an  ANCOVA  model,  with treatment  and  site  as  fixed  effects  and  the  aver­ age  baseline  ADHD  index  score  as  a  covariate. For  significant  overall  treatment  effects, pairwise  comparisons  were  performed  using a  closed-testing  procedure:  a  t-test  between the  least-squares  means  of  the  MAS  XR  60-mg and  placebo  groups  was  performed  first;  if  a significant  difference  was  detected,  the  same test  was  performed  for  the  40-mg  and  20-mg groups.  To  determine  the  treatment  effect  at 4-  and  12-hours  postdose,  a  similar  analysis was  performed  for  both  postdose  ADHD  index scores at endpoint. A  dichotomized  variable  was  created  for the  CGI-I:  the  "improved"  category  included subjects  "very  much  improved"  and  "much improved";  the  "not  improved"  category included  all  other  ratings.  For  placebo  and active  treatment  pairs,  the  dichotomized  CGI-I at  endpoint  was  analyzed  for  differences  using a  CMH  test  adjusted  for  site.The  CGI-S  and  CGIE  results  were  summarized  as  categorical  vari­ ables (n, % for each rating). **Post-Hoc Efficacy Analyses** To  further  investigate  the  dose-response relationship  between  ADHD  Rating  Scale scores  and  actual  final  dose  (adjusted  for  final dose  duration  and  baseline  severity),  a  1-way ANCOVA  was  performed.  Actual  dose  was  the effect,  and  baseline  ADHD  Rating  Scale  total score  was  a  covariate.The  difference  in  ADHD Rating  Scale  change  from  baseline  among the  active  doses  was  assessed  for  each  treat­ ment  week.  Actual  dose  refers  to  the  final  dose achieved,  which  in  some  cases  was  less  than the  dose  assigned  by  randomization.  Because this  was  a  forced-dose-escalation  design,  sub­ jects  assigned  to  higher  doses  did  not  achieve their  final  assigned  dose  until  midway  through the  study.  Some  subjects  may  have  withdrawn from  the  study  before  reaching  the  assigned dose.  The  model  included  the  placebo  dose  to address  the  issue  of  minimum  effective  dose. Analyses  were  performed  on  ITT  subjects  seg­ regated  by  the  median  baseline  ADHD  Rating Scale  score:  <32  (mild)  and  >32  (severe).  The median  baseline  score  was  chosen  to  provide similar sample sizes for this analysis. The  linear  association  between  final  MAS  XR dose  at  each  treatment  week  and  the  propor­

# tion  of  subjects  rated  "very  much  improved"  or 

# "much  improved"  on  the  CGI-I  scale  was  ana­

# lyzed using the Mantel-Haenszel x2 test.

# **Safety Analyses**

# Treatment-emergent  AEs  were  summarized 

# by  body  system,  preferred  term,  and  treatment group.  Because  the  same  subject  may  have 

# reported  the  same  AE  when  receiving  different 

# doses  of  MAS  XR  in  this  forced-dose-escala­ tion  design,  the  counts  (and  percentages)  of AEs  by  treatment  group  are  not  independent observations.This  lack  of  independence  could affect  the  variability  and  would  invalidate  a test  that  assumes  independence  of  the  pro­

# portions.  Because  there  is  no  methodology for  a  statistical  test  for  linear  trends  in  propor­ tions  where  the  proportions  are  dependent,  no statistical  test  for  a  dose  relationship  for  AEs was  conducted.  An  ANCOVA  model  with  treat­ ment  as  a  fixed  effect  and  baseline  as  a  covariate  was  fitted  to  the  laboratory,  vital  sign,  and ECG  interval  data  for  each  visit.  For  statisti­ cally  significant  treatment  effects,  Dunnett's test  assessed  which  active-treatment  groups differed  significantly  from  the  placebo  group. 

# ECGs  included  interval  measurements  (RR 

# interval,  PR,  QRS,  QT,  QTcB  [Bazett  correction], 

# heart  rate)  and  tracing  interpretations  (rhythm, conduction,  morphology,  myocardial  infarc­ tion, ST segments,T waves, U waves).

# **Post-Hoc Safety Analyses**

# Outlier  analyses  of  safety  measures,  includ­

# ing  AE  reports,  vital  signs,  and  ECGs  (including QTcF  [Fridericia  correction])  were  completed  to further  investigate  the  dose-response  relation­ ship  for  safety  measures.  Individual  BP  measure­

# ments  >140  mmHg  for  systolic  or  >90  mmHg  for diastolic  on  two  consecutive  visits  were  consid­ ered  clinically  significant.28  A  predefined  limit  of >110  beats  per  minute  was  considered  clinically significant  for  individual  pulse  measurements. 

# Individual  changes  in  QT  or  QTcF  intervals  >60 

# milliseconds  relative  to  baseline  values  were considered clinically noteworthy.30

### **RESULTS**

# **Study Sample**

# Eighteen  study  sites  screened  339  adults, and  259  subjects  entered  the  washout  phase of  the  study;  255  were  randomly  assigned  to treatment,  and  248  were  included  in  the  ITT sample (Figure 2).

# **Clinical Global Impressions** Only  27%  of  placebo  subjects  experienced  robust improvement  (endpoint  CGI-I  score  of  1  or  2  ["very much  improved"  or  "much  improved"])  compared with  55%  of  subjects  receiving  MAS  XR  (103/188). The  nonzero  correlation  CMH  statistic  showed  a statistically  significant  correlation  (Pc.OOl)  between dose  and  the  percentage  of  subjects  considered improved  by  investigators  (includes  ratings  of  "very much  improved"  or  "much  improved"  on  the  CGI-I scale)  (Table  3).The  post-hoc  analysis of CGI-I  indi­ cated that,  at week  2, when  subjects assigned  to the 40- and  60-mg groups  received 40 mg/ day, the  linear relationship  between  dose  and  proportion  of  sub­ jects  considered  improved  was  statistically  signifi­ cant (P=.O3).  At weeks  3 and  4, when  subjects were receiving  assigned  doses  (20,  40,  or  60  mg/day) according  to  the  forced-dose-escalation  design,  the association  between  MAS  XR  dose  and  the  propor­ tion  of  subjects  who  were  improved  was  statistically significant (P=.01 and P=.04,  weeks 3 and 4, respec­ tively  [Figure  4]).These  findings  demonstrate  a  clear dose-response for efficacy as measured by the CGI-I.

# Substantially  more  subjects  receiving  MAS  XR 

# 20  mg/day  (56%),  40  mg/day  (59%),  or  60  mg/day 

# (60%)  reported  either  "marked—vast  improvement" 

# or  "moderate—decided  improvement"  on  the  CGI-E 

# Therapeutic  Effects  scale  than  did  subjects  receiving 

# placebo  (25%).  There  was  a  suggestion  of  a  dose­

# response  effect  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  with 

# "marked—vast  improvement"  increased  with  dose. 

# Most  subjects  reported  "none"  or  "do  not  signifi­

# cantly  interfere  with  functioning"  on  the  CGI-E  Side 

# Effects  scale  (placebo  group:  97%;  20-mg  group: 

# 84%;  40-mg  group:  84%;  60-mg  group:  85%).  Few 

# subjects  in  any  treatment  group  reported  that  side 

# effects  "outweighed  therapeutic  benefit"  (placebo 

# group:  3%;  20-mg  group:  6%;  40-mg  group:  6%; 

# and  60-mg  group:  5%).The  post-hoc  dose-response 

# analysis of  the CGI-E  data suggested  that there  were 

# significantly  fewer  side  effects  relative  to  therapeutic 

# improvement  in  the  higher-dose  groups  (x2(6)=21.1; 

# P=. 002).This  effect  was  stronger  for  subjects  with 

# high ADHD symptom severity at baseline.

# **Safety**

# All  259  subjects  enrolled  were  included  in  the AE  evaluation.The  ITT  sample  (n=255)  was  evalu­

# ated for all other safety measures.

# **Adverse Events**

# No  serious  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported. The  incidences  of  treatment-related  AEs  are  sum­

# marized  inTable  4.The  most  commonly  reported AEs  were  dry  mouth  (27.4%  of  all  subjects 

# enrolled),  anorexia/decreased  appetite  (25.5%), 

# insomnia  (23.9%),  and  headache  (23.6%).  Most  AEs were  mild  or  moderate  in  intensity.  Insomnia  was the  only  severe  AE  reported  in  two  or  more  MAS XR-treated  subjects  (20-mg  group:  n=2;  40-mg group:  n=3;  60-mg  group:  n=4).  Most  AEs  occurred during the first treatment week.

# Twenty-four  subjects  withdrew  from  the  study due  to  AEs:  one  (1.6%)  placebo-treated  subject, 

# nine  (13.6%)  MAS  XR  20-mg  subjects,  6  (9.4%) 40-mg  subjects,  and  eight  (13.1%)  60-mg  sub­ jects  (Figure  2).  The  most  common  AEs  lead­ ing  to  discontinuation  were  insomnia  (10  [3.9%] subjects),  agitation  (four  [1.6%]  subjects),  anxi­ ety (four 1.6%), and nervousness (four 1.6%).

# Three  subjects  were  withdrawn  from  the  study due  to  cardiovascular  AEs  (two  tachycardia;  one hypertension),  one  participant  had  increased 

# liver  enzymes,  and  one  experienced  chest  pain of  unclear  etiology.  None  of  the  subjects  required treatment for an AE.

# **Other Safety Assessments**

# There  was  a  slight  decrease  from  baseline to  endpoint  in  mean  cholesterol  (-2.4  mg/dL) for  placebo,  compared  with  larger,  statistically significant  (Pc.05),  decreases  for  MAS  XR  20  mg/ day  (-15.5  mg/dL),  40  mg/day  (-16.0  mg/dL),  and 60  mg/day  (-18.6  mg/dL).There  was  also  a  slight decrease  in  triglycerides  for  placebo  (-1.8  mg/dL) compared  with  larger,  statistically  significant 

# (Pc.05),  decreases  for  MAS  XR  20  mg/day  (-31.0 

# mg/dL),  40  mg/day  (-20.0  mg/dL)  and  60  mg/day 

# (-42.4  mg/dL).  Changes  in  mean  laboratory  val­

# ues  from  baseline  to  endpoint  were  otherwise small  in  magnitude  and  showed  no  apparent trend.  Changes  in  individual  laboratory  values observed  during  this  study  seemed  to  be  sponta­

# neous  events  and,  with  one  exception  (increased 

# liver  enzymes),  were  not  considered  clinically significant.  Changes  in  physical  examinations were  similar  across  placebo  and  MAS  XR  groups. A  statistically  significant  treatment  effect  of  MAS XR  on  weight  was  observed  (2-way  ANCOVA, 

# Pc.001):  the  mean  weight  loss  between  baseline and  endpoint  was  1.1  ±1.8  kg  for  the  20-mg  group (P=.O1),  2.5±2.3  kg  for  the  40-mg  group  (Pc.001), and  2.5±2.5  kg  for  the  60-mg  group  (Pc.001) compared  with  a  mean  weight  gain  of  0.1±2.7  kg for  subjects  receiving  placebo.  However,  weight loss  was  not  considered  clinically  significant  in any individual subject.

# **Vital Signs**

# Mean  changes  in  vital  signs  were  moderate and  not  considered  clinically  meaningful.  A  2way  ANCOVA  indicated  a  statistically  significant treatment  effect  of  MAS  XR  on  pulse  (P=.025) and  systolic  BP  (P=.O15)  but  not  on  diastolic  BP (P=.  135).  Dunnett's  test  for  multiple  compari­ sons  was  used  to  further  analyze  mean  changes in  pulse  and  systolic  BP  for  each  MAS  XR  group compared  with  placebo.  Between  baseline  and endpoint,  mean±SD  changes  in  pulse  (beats  per minute)  were  4.2±9.7  (P=.582),  5.3±11.3  (P=.O53), 6.2±10.9  (P=.O16)  in  the  20-,  40-,  and  60-mg groups,  respectively,  compared  with  1.9+10.4 beats  per  minute  for  the  placebo  group.  For systolic  BP  (mmHg),  mean±SD  changes  were 0.3±11.2 (P=.191), 4.3±12.3 (P=.004 ), and 0.9+10.2 

# (P=.219)  in  the  20,  40-,  and  60-mg  groups, 

# respectively,  compared  with  -1.9±10.1  mmHg  in the placebo group.

# A  post-hoc  outlier  analysis  of  vital  signs  did not  reveal  a  dose-response  relationship  for 

# MAS  XR  20  mg/day  to  MAS  XR  60  mg/day  for 

# pulse,  systolic  BP,  or  diastolic  BP.  Only  one  sub­

# ject  in  each  treatment  group  had  a  pulse  >110 

# beats  per  minute  at  any  point,  and  changes  >25 

# beats  per  minute  were  transitory  and  not  dose 

# dependent.  Although  MAS  XR  appears  to  have 

# a  slight  effect  on  systolic  BP,  the  outlier  analysis 

# did  not  indicate  a  dose-response  relationship. 

# A  small  number  of  subjects  receiving  placebo 

# or  MAS  XR  had  generally  transient  systolic  BP 

# increases  of  >20  mmHg  and  few  subjects  had 

# two  consecutive  measurements  >140  mmHg 

# (one,  four,  one,  and  three  subjects  in  the  pla­

# cebo,  20-,  40-,  and  60-mg  MAS  XR  groups, 

# respectively).  Similarly,  few  subjects  had  dia­

# stolic  BP  increases  of  >10  mmHg  from  baseline 

# and  few  had  measurements  >90  mmHg  at  two 

# consecutive  visits  (four,  three,  one,  and  three 

# subjects  in  the  placebo,  20-,  40-,  and  60-mg 

# MAS  XR  groups,  respectively).  No  apparent 

# trends  were  identified  for  any  of  the  cardiovas­

# cular  measurements  with  respect  to  absolute 

# increases  from  baseline  or  increases  above  the 

# threshold values on consecutive visits.

# **Electrocardiograms**

# The  ECG  data  did  not  suggest  any  clinically 

# significant  cardiovascular  treatment  effects  asso­

# ciated  with  MAS  XR  in  adults.  The  incidence  of 

# qualitative  ECG  abnormalities  was  similar  for 

# subjects  receiving  placebo  and  for  subjects 

# receiving  MAS  XR,  and  the  abnormalities  were 

# either  normal  variants  or  they  were  of  limited 

# clinical relevance.

# Analyses  of  ECG  interval  measurements  by 

# 2-way  ANCOVA  revealed  no  clinically  meaning­

# ful  differences  in  PR  (P=.354)  or  QRS  (P=.204) 

# intervals  from  baseline  to  endpoint  between 

# MAS  XR  (all  doses)  and  placebo.  Statistically 

# significant  treatment  effects  (ANCOVA)  were 

# noted fo r heart  rate (Pc.001)  and f or QT  (P=.OO2) 

# and  QTcB  (P=.OO3)  intervals.The  mean  changes 

# for  each  treatment  group  were  not  considered 

# clinically  significant  and  were  not  statistically 

# significant  in  many  cases  when  further  ana­

# lyzed  by  dose  (Dunnett's  test  was  used  for  the 

# construction  of  treatment  group  P-values).The 

# mean  changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint  for 

# heart  rate  (beats  per  minute)  were  -2.0±9  for 

# the  placebo  group;  2.6±9  for  the  20-mg  group 

# (P=.O35);  7.3±12  for  the  40-mg  group  (Pc.001), 

# and  4.8±11 for  the  60-mg  group  (P<.001).The 

# mean  changes  from  baseline  to  endpoint  for 

# the  QT  interval  (milliseconds)  were  2.9±22  for

The  post-hoc  analysis  using  the  Fridericia method  of  correction  indicated  no  statisti­ cally  significant  change  from  baseline  in  the QTcF  intervals  for  MAS  XR  (all  doses)  versus placebo  (ANCOVA,  P=.132).The  mean  QTcF interval  changes  (milliseconds)  from  baseline to  endpoint  were  —1.5±16  for  the  20-mg  group (P=. 149);  —1.1 ±21  for the  40-mg group  (P=.465); and  —1.1  ±19  for  the  60-mg  group  (P=.O75). Dunnett's  test  was  used  for  the  construction  of treatment  group  P-values.  At  endpoint,  mean QT  intervals  did  not  exceed  436  milliseconds for  the  MAS  XR  groups  or  433  milliseconds  for the  placebo  group.  A  few  30-59  milliseconds increases  were  recorded,  but  these  changes were  evenly  distributed  across  the  placebo  and MAS  XR  groups.  None  of  the  subjects  in  any treatment  group  experienced  a  >60  millisec­ onds increase in QT or QTcF intervals.

# **DISCUSSION__________________________** In  this  largest  adult  ADHD  stimulant  study  to date,  results  indicate  that  once-daily  MAS  XR  20 mg/day,  40  mg/day,  and  60  mg/day  doses  were safe  and  effective  in  the  treatment  of  adult  ADHD, combined  type.  Subjects  treated  with  MAS  XR had  significantly  improved  symptoms  compared with  placebo,  as  determined  by  the  ADHD  Rating Scale.  Improved  symptoms  were  detected  within the  first  treatment  week  and  maintained  through­ out  the  study.  Although  the  lowest  dose  used in  this  study  (20  mg/day)  led  to  some  improve­ ment,  the  40  mg/day  and  60  mg/day  doses  led  to increasing  levels  of  efficacy.The  dose-response  of efficacy  seemed  to  be  related  to  symptom  sever­ ity:  adults  with  mild  symptoms  had  significantly greater  improvements  with  the  lowest  MAS  XR dose  (20  mg/day),  whereas  those  with  severe symptoms  had  significantly  greater  improve­ ments  with  the  highest  dose  (60  mg/day).  The mean  effect  size  for  MAS  XR  20,  40,  and  60  mg/ day  was  0.8  based  on  ADHD  Rating  Scale  total scores at endpoint. Treatment  efficacy  is  arguably  most  diffi­ cult to demonstrate in combined-type adult

# ADHD,  because  hyperactive/impulsive  symp­ toms  become  less  problematic  in  adulthood.12 Significant  improvements  in  ADHD  Rating Scale  inattentive  and  hyperactivity/impulsiv-

# ity  subscale  scores  were  demonstrated  in  all 

# MAS  XR  groups  compared  with  placebo,  but a  dose-response  effect  was  not  observed  for either subscale.

# As  expected,  daily  symptom  relief  continued for  up  to  12  hours  for  all  MAS  XR  doses  as  dem­ onstrated  by  CAARS-S-S  ADHD  index  scores. This  is  an  important  benefit  for  individuals  with ADHD,  given  the  potential  for  missed  doses with  multiple  daily  dose  regimens.  Additionally, compliance  with  XR  stimulant  medications  is 

# improved,31  and  the  XR  platform  of  these  formu­ lations  may  result  in  a  lower  abuse  liability  rela­ tive to IR stimulant formulations.31

# Subjects  receiving  MAS  XR  had  greater 

# improvements  on  all  CGI  measures  compared with  those  receiving  placebo.  Nearly  30%  of MAS  XR-treated  subjects  achieved  remission, as  defined  by  CGI-S  scores  of  1  or  2  at  end­ point.The  CGI-I  indicated  statistically  signifi­ cant  global  improvements,  with  a  clear  dose response  for  efficacy  for  all  MAS  XR  groups when  analyzed  by  final  dose.  Analysis  of  the CGI-ETherapeutic  Effects  and  Side  Effects  scales suggests  that  the  therapeutic  benefit  of  treat­ ment  outweighs  the  impact  of  side  effects  in the  higher-dose  groups,  particularly  for  subjects with higher symptom severity at baseline.

# ADHD  medications  modulate  the  cogni­ tive  processes  of  attention  and  impulse  con­ trol  through  effects  on  both  dopaminergic  and noradrenergic  neurotransmitter  systems.32 Stimulants  are  indirect  agonists  of  catecholaminergic  transmission  in  the  central  nervous system  and  increase  the  amount  of  dopamine and  norepinephrine  available  presynaptically.32 The  differences  in  synaptic  mechanisms  of action  of  amphetamine  and  methylphenidate (MPH)  may  explain  the  differential  response to  these  medications  in  some  patients.33  Both medications  block  the  reuptake  of  catechol­ amines  by  binding  to  catecholamine  reuptake transporter  proteins,  but  amphetamine  can  also be  transported  into  the  nerve  terminal  via  the transporter  proteins  and  enhance  the  release of  neurotransmitters  stored  in  cytoplasmic  ves­ icles.34  Bupropion,  atomoxetine,  and  tricyclic antidepressants  also  affect  catecholaminergic transmission,  although  the  clinical  effect  of

# these  medications  appears  to  be  somewhat  less 

# robust than that of stimulant medications.

# The  average  effect  size  of  MAS  XR  (calcu­

# lated  without  regard  to  severity  of  illness  at 

# baseline)  was  0.8  in  this  study,  which  is  simi­ lar  to  effect  sizes  reported  for  other  studies  of stimulant  medications  in  adults  with  ADHD. 

# Faraone  and  colleagues36  completed  a  meta­ analysis  of  six  placebo-controlled  studies  of 

# MPH  in  adults  with  ADHD  and  reported  a  mean effect  size  of  0.9.  The  treatment  effect  sizes  for stimulant  medications  are  higher  than  those  for nonstimulant  medications  in  adults  with  ADHD. An  effect  size  of  0.6  based  on  ADHD  Rating Scale  total  scores  was  reported  for  a  short­ term,  placebo-controlled,  flexible-dose  study by  Wilens  and  colleagues36  of  an  extendedrelease  bupropion  formulation  (bupropion  XL). Effect  sizes  of  0.35  and  0.40  based  on  the  inves­ tigator-rated  CAARS-S-S  were  reported  for  two short-term,  placebo-controlled,  flexible-dose atomoxetine  studies.33  Demographic  charac­ teristics  and  baseline  symptom  severity  were similar  for  both  the  MAS  XR  and  atomoxetine adult  study  samples,37  whereas  subjects  in  the bupropion  XL  study  had  more  severe  symp­ toms  at  baseline  (mean  baseline  ADHD  Rating Scale  score  of  36)  and  37%  of  the  subjects  had ADHD, inattentive subtype.36

# Response  rates  for  MAS  XR  (defined  as >30%  improvement  on  the  ADHD  Rating  Scale total  score  at  endpoint)  are  similar  to  those 

# reported  for  other  large,  well-controlled  studies 

# in  adults  with  ADHD.  In  a  forced-dose-escalation  study  of  dexmethylphenidate  extended- 

# release  (D-MPH  XR)  in  221  adults,38  response 

# rates  were  34%  for  placebo;  58%  for  D-MPH  XR 20  mg/day;  54%  for  D-MPH  XR  30  mg/day,  and 61%  for  D-MPH  XR  40  mg/day.  In  the  Wilens and  colleagues36  study  of  bupropion  XL  in  162 adults  with  ADHD,  ~50%  of  subjects  achieved 

# at  least  a  30%  reduction  in  ADHD  Rating  Scale total  scores  compared  with  30%  of  placebo  sub­ jects.The  magnitude  of  difference  in  response 

# rates  for  the  placebo  versus  active  groups  in  all these  large,  well-controlled,  multicenter  studies 

# appears  to  be  =20  percentage  points.  Higher 

# response  rates  may  be  achieved  with  higher 

# doses.  In  smaller  (N<40),  single-site  studies  of 

# adults  with  ADHD,18'19'38  response  rates  of  70%, 

# 78%,  and  76%  have  been  reported  for  MAS  IR 

# 54  mg/day,  MPH  IR  0.9  mg/kg/day,  and  bupro­

# pion 362 mg/day, respectively.

# An  MAS  XR  dose  relationship  was  not  estab­

# lished  for  any  safety  assessment.  Overall,  treat­

# ment-related  AEs  (eg,  dry  mouth,  anorexia, 

# insomnia,  and  headache)  were  similar  in  type 

# to  those  reported  in  children.  Most  adults  in  this 

# study  were  stimulant  naive,  which  may  account 

# for  the  higher  incidence  of  AEs  compared  with 

# studies  of  children  with  ADHD,  who  typically 

# have  a  history  of  stimulant  treatment.  Of  note, 

# side  effects  diminished  rapidly  over  time;  >40% 

# of  the  treatment-emergent  AEs  were  reported 

# during  the  first  week  of  treatment  and  <10% 

# were reported during the fourth week.

# MAS  XR  appears  to  have  an  acceptable  car­

# diovascular  safety  profile  in  adults  with  ADHD. 

# Group  mean  changes  in  vital  signs  were  not 

# clinically  significant.  Individual  changes  in  BP 

# and  pulse  were  sporadic  and  resolved  sponta­

# neously.  The  ECG  data  indicated  no  clinically 

# relevant  effects  on  ECG  measurements,  and  no 

# clear  dose-response  relationships  were  evident 

# for  any  cardiovascular  safety  measures.  No 

# treatment-emergent  abnormalities  in  cardiac 

# conduction were found.

# Based  on  an  August  2004  MAS  XR  prod­

# uct  label  revision40  cautioning  against  the  use 

# of  MAS  XR  in  patients  with  structural  cardiac 

# abnormalities,  Health  Canada  suspended  the 

# sale  of  MAS  XR  throughout  Canada  in  February 

# 2005.  Despite  the  action  of  this  regulatory 

# agency,  the  Food  and  Drug  Administration  took 

# no  additional  action,  having  concluded  that  the 

# sudden  death  rate  associated  with  MAS  XR 

# was  no  greater  than  that  expected  in  patients 

# not  exposed  to  MAS  XR.  In  August  2005, 

# Health  Canada  reinstated  the  marketing  autho­

# rization  of  MAS  XR.  Nevertheless,  like  other 

# stimulants,  the  FDA  labeling  for  MAS  XR  car­

# ries  a  warning  against  the  misuse  of  amphet­

# amine  because  of  the  risk  for  sudden  death  and 

# serious  cardiovascular  adverse  events.  Hence, 

# clinicians  are  urged  to  follow  the  recommen­

# dations  of  the  American  Heart  Association41 

# suggesting  a  careful  patient  history,  evaluation 

# of  symptoms,  and  evaluation  of  medication 

# use,  including  over-the-counter  medications, 

# with  the  detection  of  symptoms  or  risk  fac­

# tors  prompting  a  cardiovascular  examination, 

# prior  to  being  prescribed  MAS  XR  or  any  other 

# stimulant  medication,  in  light  of  the  potential

Original Research

# Limitations  of  this  4-week  study  relate  pri­

# marily  to  the  diagnostic  criteria  for  adult  ADHD, 

# combined  type.  Because  many  adults  with  ADHD 

# are  below  the  diagnostic  threshold  for  hyper-

# activity/impulsivity,  the  study  sample  (ADHD, 

# combined  type)  may  not  be  representative  of 

# the  general  adult  ADHD  sample.  In  addition, 

# the  forced-dose-escalation  study  design  may 

# have  underestimated  efficacy  because  subjects 

# assigned  to  higher  doses  did  not  achieve  their 

# final  assigned  dose  until  midway  through  the 

# study,  or  overestimated  side  effects  because  AE 

# reports were cumulative for all doses.

### **CONCLUSION_________________________**

# This  short-term,  placebo-controlled,  forced-

# dose-escalation  study  found  that  once-daily 

# doses  of  MAS  XR  20  mg,  40  mg,  and  60  mg 

# were  safe  and  effective  in  adults  with  ADHD. 

# Treatment  response  based  on  post-hoc  anal­ ysis  was  related  to  ADHD  symptom  severity: 

# MAS  XR  20  mg/day  was  effective  for  subjects with  low  symptom  severity  at  baseline,  and  a trend  toward  dose  response  for  efficacy  was 

# observed  for  adults  with  higher  baseline  symp­ tom  severity.  All  doses  of  MAS  XR  adequately controlled  ADHD  symptoms  for  up  to  12  hours 

# and  were  well  tolerated,  with  no  evidence  of  a 

# dose-response  relationship  for  safety  assess­

# ments.  Because  treatment  response  appears  to depend  on  baseline  symptom  severity,  MAS  XR should  be  dosed  to  optimal  efficacy  based  on an  objective  symptom  rating  scale.  Additional 

# research  is  needed  to  document  whether  these short-term  benefits  are  sustained  during  long­ term treatment. **CNS**

**INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Bipolar Mania SEROQUEL is indicated for the treatment of acute manic episodes asso­**

**ciated with bipolar I disorder, as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex. The efficacy of**

**SEROQUEL in acute bipolar mania was established in two 12-week monotherapy Inals and one 3-week adjunct ther­**

**apy trial of bipolar I patients initially hospitalized for up to 7 days for acute mama. Effectiveness has not been sys­**

**tematically evaluated in clinical trials for more than 12 weeks in monotherapy and 3 weeks in adjunct therapy.**

**Therefore, the physician who elects to use SEROQUEL for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long­**

**term risks and benefits of the drug for the individual patient Schizophrenia SEROQUEL is indicated for the treat­** **men!** **of schizophrenia. The efficacy of SEROQUEL in schizophrenia was established in short-term (6-week) con-** **trolled trials of schizophrenic inpatients. The effect.veness of SEROQUEL in long-term use, that is, for more than 6 weeks,** **has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use SEROQUEL for** **extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.**

**CONTRAINDICATIONS: SEROQUEL is contraindicated in individuals with a known hypersensitivity to this medication**

**or any of its ingredients.**

**WARNINGS: Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis: Elderly patients with** 

**dementia-related psychosis treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death compared**

**to placebo. SEROQUEL (quetiapine) Is not approved lor the treatment ol patients with dementia-related psy­**

**chosis (see Boxed Warning). Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). A potentially fatal symptom complex some­**

**times referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of**

**antipsychotic drugs, including SEROQUEL. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with SEROQUEL. Clinical mani­**

**festations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability**

**(irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may indude**

**elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure. The diagnostic evaluation**

**of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to exclude cases where the**

**clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g.,pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated**

**or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential**

**diagnosis include central anticholinergic tax city, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS)**

**pathology. The management of NMS should include: 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other**

**drugs not essential to concurrent therapy; 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring; and 3) treat­**

**ment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general**

**agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for NMS. If a patient requires antipsychotic drug**

**treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The**

**patient should be carefully monitored since recurrences of NMS have been reported. Tardive Dyskinesia: A syn­**

**drome of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements may develop in patients treated with antipsy­**

**chotic drugs. Although the prevalence of the syndrome appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderty**

**women, it is impossible to rely upon prevalence estimates to predict, at the inception of antipsychotic treatment,** **which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to** **cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become**

**irreversible are believed to increase as the duration of treatment and the total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs** **administered to the patient increase. However, the syndrome can develop, although much less commonly, after rel­** **atively brief treatment periods at low doses. There is no known treatment for established cases of tardive dyslcnesia.** **although the syndrome may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is withdrawn. Antipsychotic** **treatment, itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome and there­**

**by may possibly mask the undertying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term** **course of the syndrome is unknown. Given these considerations, SEROQUEL should be presented in a manner that** **is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be** **reserved tor patients who appear to suffer from a chronic illness that (1) is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs,** **and (2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropri­** **ate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment produc­** **ing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed peri­** **odically. If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on SEROQUEL, drug discontinuation should** **be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with SEROQUEL despite the presence of the syndrome.**

**Hyperglycemia and Diabetes Me 11 Itus: Hyperglycemia, in some cases extreme and associated with ketoacidosis or** **hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, including SEROQUEL.** **Assessment of the relationship between atypical antipsychotic use and glucose abnormalities is qomplicated by the** **possibility of an increased background risk of diabetes meliitus in patients with schizophrenia and the increasing inci­** **dence of diabetes meliitus in the general population. Grven these confounders, the relationship between atypical** **antipsychotic use and hyperglycemia-related adverse events is not completely understood. However, epidemiologi­** **cal studies suggest an increased risk of treatment-emergent hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients**

**treated with the atypical antipsychotics Precise risk estimates for hyperglycemia-related adverse events in patients** **treated with atypical antipsychotics are not available. Patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes meliitus who** **are started on atypical antipsychotics should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. Patients with** **risk factors for diabetes meliitus (eg, obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical** **antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing at the beginning of treatment and periodically during** **treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia** **including polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weakness. Patients who develop symptoms of hyperglycemia during** **treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing. In some cases, hyperglycemia** **has resolved when the atypical antipsychotic was discontinued; however, some patients required continuation of anti­** **diabetic treatment despite discontinuation of the suspect drug.** **PRECAUTIONS: General: Orthostatic Hypotension: SEROQUEL may induce orthostatic hypotension associated with** **dizziness, tachycardia and, in some patients, syncope, especially during the initial dose-titration period, probably** **reflecting its a,-adrenergic antagonist properties. Syncope was reported in 1% (23/2567) of the patients treated with** **SEROQUEL, compared with 0% (0/607) on placebo and about 0.4% (2/527) on active control drugs. SEROQUEL** **should be used with particular caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (history of myocardial infarc­** **tion or ischemic heart disease, heart failure or conduction abnormalities), cerebrovascular disease or conditions** **which would predispose patients to hypotension (dehydration, hypovolemia and treatment with antihypertensive** **medications). The risk of orthostatic hypotension ana syncope may be minimized by limiting the initial dose to** **25 mg bid. If hypotension occurs during titration to the target dose, a return to the previous dose in the titration** **schedule is appropriate. Cataracts: The development of cataracts was observed in association with quetiapine** **tzaalmafrtIn** **chronic in rtudiea(see** **Animal Toxicology), Lens changeshave** **alio been observed In pallente** **during long-term SEROQUEL treatment, but a causal relationship to SEROQUEL use has not been established.** **Nevertheless, the possibility of lenticular changes cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, examination of** **the lens by methods adequate to detect cataract formation, such as silt lamp exam or other appropriately sen­** **sitive methods, Is recommended at initiation of treatment or shortly thereafter, and at 6 month Intervals during** **chronic treatment. Seizures: During clinical trials, seizures occurred In 0.6% (18/2792) of patients treated with** **SEROQUEL compared to 0.2% (1/607)** or**placebo and 0.7% (4/527) on active control drugs. As with other antipsy­** **chotics SEROQUEL should be used cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that potentially** **lower the seizure threshold, e.g., Alzheimer s dementia. Conditions that lower the seizure threshold may be more** **prevalent in a population of 65 years or older. Hypothyroidism: Clinical trials with SEROQUEL demonstrated a dose-** **related decrease in total and free thyroxine (T4) of approximately 20% at the higher end of the therapeutic dose range** **and was maximal in the first two to four weeks of treatment and maintained without adaptation or progression dur­** **ing more chronic therapy Generally, these changes were of no clinical significance and TSH was unchanged in most** **patients, and levels of TBG were unchanged. In nearly all cases, cessation of SEROQUEL treatment was associated** **with a reversal of the effects on total and free T4, irrespective of the duration of treatment. About 0.4% (12/2791)** **ol SEROQUEL patients did experience TSH increases in monotherapy studies. Six of the patients with TSH increas­** **es needed replacement thyroid treatment. In the mama adjunct studies, where SEROQUEL was added to lithium or** **divalproate, 12% (24/196) of SEROQUEL treated patients compared to 7% (15/203) of placebo treated patients had** **elevated TSH leveis Of me SEROQUEL treated patients with elevated TSH levels, 3 had simultaneous low free T4** **levels. Cholesterol and Triglyceride Elevations: In schizophrenia trials, SEROQUEL treated patients had increases** **from baseline in cholesterol and triglyceride of 11% and 1 /%, respectively, compared to slight decreases for place­** **bo patients. These changes were only weakly related to the increases in weight observed in SEROQUEL treated** **patients. Hyperprolactinemia: Although an elevation of prolactin levels was not demonstrated in clinical trials with** **SEROQUEL, increased prolactin levels were observed In rat studies with this compound, and were associated with** **an increase in mammary gland neoplasia in rats (see Carcinogenesis). Tissue culture experiments indicate that** **approximately one-third of human breast cancers are prolactin dependent** **in vitro,a factor of potential importance if** **the prescription of these drugs is contemplated in a patient with previously detected breast cancer. Although distur­** **bances such as galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gynecomastia and impotence have been reported with prolactin-elevat­** **ing compounds, the clinical significance of elevated serum prolactin levels is unknown for most patients. Neither clin­**

**ical studies nor epidemiologic studies conducted to date have shown an association between chronic administration**

**of this class of drugs and tumorigenesis in humans; the available evidence is considered too limited to be conclusive** **at this time Transaminase Elevations; Asymptomatic, transient and reversible elevations in serum transaminases**

**(primarily ALT) have been reported. In schizophrenia trials, the proportions of patients with transaminase elevations**

**of > 3 times the upper limits ol the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to 6-week placebo-controlled trials were**

**approximately 6% for SEROQUEL compared to 1% for placebo. In acute bipolar mania trials, the proportions of**

**patients with transaminase elevations of > 3 times the upper limits of the normal reference range in a pool of 3- to**

**with Concomitant Illness: Clinical experience with SEROQUEL in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness­**

**es is limited. SEROQUEL has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history**

**of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Patients with these diagnoses were excluded from premarketing**

**clinical studies. Because of the risk of orthostatic hypotension with SEROQUEL, caution should be observed in car­**

**diac patients (see Orthostatic Hypotension). Information for Patients: Physicians are advised to discuss the follow­**

**ing issues with patients for whom they prescribe SEROQUEL. Orthostatic Hypotension: Patients should be advised**

**of the risk of orthostatic hypotension, especially (luring the 3-5 day period of initial dose titration, and also at times**

**of re-initiating treatment or increases m dose. Interference with Cognitive and Motor Performance: Since somno­**

**lence was a commonly reported adverse event associated with SEROQUEL treatment, patients should be advised of**

**the risk of somnolence, especially during the 3-5 day period of initial dose titration. Patients should be cautioned**

**about performing any activity requiring mental alertness, such as operating a motor vehicle (including automobiles)**
