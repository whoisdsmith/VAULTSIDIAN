Clozapine and cocaine effects on dopamine and serotonin release in 

# nucleus accumbens during psychostimulant behavior and withdrawal

# Patricia A. Brodericka,b’c’d’*, Omotola Hope3’0,1, Catherine Okonjia,c’2, 

There  is  an  increasing  awareness  that  a  psychosis,  similar  to  that  of  schizophrenic  psychosis,  can  be  derived  from  cocaine  addiction. 

Thus,  the  prototypical  atypical  antipsychotic  medication,  clozapine,  a  5-HT2/DA2  antagonist,  was  studied  for  its  effects  on  cocaine-

induced  dopamine  (DA)  and  serotonin  (5-HT)  release  in  nucleus  accumbens  (NAcc)  of  behaving  male  Sprague-Dawley  laboratory  rats with  In  Vivo  Microvoltammetry,  while  animals’  locomotor  (forward  ambulations),  an  Alo  behavior,  was  monitored  at  the  same  time  with 

infrared  photobeams.  Release  mechanisms  for  monoamines  were  determined  by  using  a  depolarization  blocker,  gamma-butyrolactone 

(yBL).  BRODERICK  PROBE®  microelectrodes  selectively  detected  release  of  DA  and  5-HT  within  seconds  and  sequentially  in  Alo nerve  terminals,  NAcc.  Acute  and  subacute  studies  were  performed  for  each  treatment  group.  Acute  studies  are  defined  as  single  injection 

of  drug(s)  after  a  stable  baseline  of  each  monoamine  and  locomotor  behavior  has  been  achieved.  Subacute  studies  are  defined  as  24h  follow-up  studies  on  each  monoamine  and  locomotor  behavior,  in  the  same  animal  at  which  time,  no  further  drug  was  administered. Results  showed  that  (1)  acute  administration  of  cocaine  (10  mg/kg  ip) (n  =  5)  significantly  increased  both  DA  and  5-HT  release  above baseline  (P  <  .001)  while  locomotion  was  also  significantly  increased  above  baseline  (P  <  .001).  In  subacute  studies,  DA  release  decreased 

significantly  below  baseline (P<.001)  and  significant  decreases  in  5-HT  release  occurred  at  the  15-min  mark  and  at  each  time  point 

during  the  second  part  of  the  hour (P  <  .05);  the  maximum  decrease  in  5-HT  was  40%  below  baseline.  Locomotor  behavior,  on  the  other hand,  increased  significantly  above  baseline  (P<  .05).  (2)  Acute  administration  of  clozapine/cocaine  (20  and  10  mg/kg  ip,  respectively; 

n  =  6)  produced  a  significant  block  of  the  cocaine-induced  increase  in  DA (P<.001)  and  5-HT  release (P<.001).  Cocaine-induced 

locomotion  was  blocked  simultaneously  with  each  monoamine  by  clozapine  as  well  (P  <  .001).  In  subacute  studies,  DA  release  continued to  be  blocked  presumably  via  clozapine  by  exhibiting  a  statistically  significant  decrease  (P<.001),  but  5-HT  release  increased 

significantly  (P<  .001),  while  cocaine-induced  locomotor  activity  also  continued  to  be  antagonized  by  clozapine,  i.e.,  locomotor  activity 

exhibited  no  difference  from  baseline  (P>  .05).  In  summary,  acute  studies  (a)  support  previous  data  from  this  laboratory  and  others  that 

cocaine acts as a stimulant on the monoamines, DA and 5-HT and on locomotor behavior as well and (b) show that clozapine, 5-HT2/DA2

Subacute  studies  (a)  suggest  that withdrawal  responses  occurred  in  the  cocaine  group,  based  on  recorded  deficiencies  in  monoamine  neurotransmitters  (b)  show  that withdrawal  effects  in  the  cocaine  group  likely  presynaptic,  were  distinguished  from  locomotor  behavior,  classically  known  to  be  mediated postsynaptically,  and  finally,  (c)  suggest  that  clozapine,  with  longer  lived  pharmacokinetic  properties,  reversed  5-HT  cocaine-related withdrawal  effects,  but  was  unable  to  reverse  DA  cocaine-related  withdrawal  responses.  Taken  together  with  data  from  this  laboratory,  in which  the  5-HT2A/2C  antagonist,  ketanserin,  affected  cocaine  neurochemistry  in  much  the  same  way  as  did  clozapine,  a  mediation  by either  separate  or  combined  5-HT2A/2c  receptors  for  these  clozapine/cocaine  interactions,  is  suggested.  Further  studies,  designed  to  tease out  the  responses  of  selective  5-HT2A  and  5-HT2C  receptor  compounds  to  cocaine  and  clozapine/cocaine,  are  underway. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

**1.  Introduction**

1.1. Addiction and psychoses

We continue to strategize  possible pharmacotherapies for cocaine-induced  psychosis  by  studying  the  effects  of  a variety  of  typical  and  atypical  antipsychotic  medications on  cocaine-induced  neurochemistry  and  psychomotor sti m­ ulant  behavior.  The  hypothesis  derives  from  similarities between  schizophrenic  and  cocaine  psychosis,  similarities which  are  being  reported  in  the  clinical  literature  at  an alarming  rate (Brady  et  al.,  1991;  Harris  and  Batki,  2000; Lysaker  et  al.,  1994;  Mendoza  et  al.,  1992;  Miller  et  al., 

1992;  Mitchell  and  Vierkant,  1991;  Nambudin  and  Young, 

1991; Rosenthal  and Miner,  1997; Rosse  et al.,  1994; Satel and  Edell,  1991;  Serper  et  al.,  1999;  Sherer  et  al.,  1988; Taylor and  Staby, 1992;  Tueth, 1993). Cocaine psychosis  is a  major  psychopathology (Satel  et  al.,  1991) and  hyper­ function  of  DA  (dopamine)-ergic  systems  is  a  critical element  in  cocaine-induced  psychosis (Lieberman  et  al., 

1990). Too, what  complicates the  situation f urther, are  data which  show  that  about  50%  of  the  patients  who  suffer  from 

schizophrenia  have  also  been  substance  abusers  at  some time during  their illness.  Actually, schizophrenic  patients are reported to feel  the need to  alleviate their psychosis  by self­ treating  with  reinforcing  drugs (Buckley,  1998;  Mueser  et al., 1995).

1.2.  Psychomotor  stimulant  animal  model  of  addiction  and psychosis

One way to strategize such tr eatments for cocaine addic­ tion  and  psychosis  is  to  reverse  certain  elements  of  the disorders  by  utilizing  laboratory  studies  in  animals (McKin­ ney, 1989). The strategy  is reasonable  especially since  data from  animal  studies  of  stimulant  psychosis  and  human 

schizophrenic psychosis share  the same neurochemical  and behavioral  manifestations (Gawin  et  al.,  1989;  Margolin  et al.,  1995;  Wise,  1995;  Wise  and  Bozarth,  1987). Also, 

because  cocaine  is  self-administered  universally  across 

species (Fischman,  1984;  Risner  and  Jones,  1980), it  is 

highly  likely  that  similar  universal  underlying  reward  mech­

anisms  and  mechanisms  of  consequent  adverse  symptom­

atology are similar from species to species.

The  animal  model  of  psychomotor  stimulant  behavior 

for  cocaine  addiction  and  psychosis  has  been  validated  by 

using  this  model  to  correlate  antipsychotic  medications 

and  DA-ergic  neuroanatomic  pathways,  for  example,  but 

not  exclusively,  typical  antipsychotics  act  through  DA 

within  nigrostriatal  pathways  and  atypical  antipsychotics 

act  through  DA  and  5-HT  within  mesolimbic  and  meso-

corticolimbic  pathways (Cools  and  van  Rossum,  1970; 

Costall  and  Naylor,  1973;  Kelly  et  al.,  1975;  Pijnenburg  et 

al.,  1975;  Wise  and  Bozarth,  1987). Human  data  support 

these  animal  data (Gawin  and  Kleber,  1986a,b;  Gawin  et 

al.,  1989;  Meltzer,  1989). Interestingly,  it  is  currently 

thought  that  both  typical  and  atypical  antipsychotic  agents 

alleviate  schizophrenic  psychosis  via  DA2  blockade  in 

mesocorticolimbic  areas,  whereas  DA2  blockade  in  nigros­

triatal  areas  is  thought  to  produce  motor  side  effects, 

extrapyramidal  symptoms  (EPS).  Nonetheless,  the  psycho­

motor  stimulant  animal  model  has  become  an  accepted 

model  to  study  cocaine  psychosis,  albeit  limited  to  certain 

aspects of  the disease. An  accepted ne uroanatomic site  for 

testing  reversal  of  positive  symptoms  of  psychosis  is 

within  nucleus  accumbens  (NAcc),  mesolimbic  nerve 

terminals (Weinberger et al., 1992).

1.3.  Cocaine, monoamine  transporters and  release 

mechanisms

Cocaine  has  a  high  affinity  for  monoamine  transporters, 

and  via  these  transporters,  re-uptake  of  monoamines  into 

presynaptic  nerve  terminals  is  inhibited (Izenwasser  et  al., 

1990;  Koe,  1976); interestingly,  certain  subjective  reward 

and  jittery  effects  from  cocaine  have  recently  been  associ­

ated  with  these  monoamine  transporters (Hall  et  al.,  2002). 

In  addition,  cocaine  has  been  shown  to  be  dependent  on

stimulated  release  mechanisms (Ng  et  al.,  1991) and  on basal  release  mechanism  by  using  the  DA  impulse  flow inhibitor,  gamma  butyrolactone  (yBL) (Broderick,  1991b). Although  cocaine  is  not  a  direct  receptor  acting  agonist, enhancement  of  DA  neurotransmission  may  also  be  pro­ vided  adjunctly  through  indirect  activation  of  DA  recep­ tors, i.e., Dj and D2 (Spealman et al., 1992; Wise, 1995).

1.4.  Cocaine,  monoamine  concentrations  and  reward mechanisms

Cocaine  increases  DA  concentrations  in  mesolimbic neuronal circuits  and the  evidence suggests  that the  mech­ anism  underlying  cocaine’s  rewarding  effect  involves  hyperfunction  of  the  mesolimbic  DA  system,  particularly  in Aio  nerve  terminals,  NAcc (Broderick,  1991a,b;  Brown  et al.,  1991;  Hernandez  andHoebel,  1988;  Kalivas  andNemeroff,  1988) and  in  Ai0  somatodendrites,  ventral  tegmental area  (VTA) (Bradberry  and  Roth,  1989;  Broderick,  1992a; Einhorn  et  al.,  1988;  Kalivas,  1993;  Kalivas  and  Duffy, 1990). There  is  a  general co nsensus f rom  both  clinical a nd preclinical studies  that DA  mediates the  rewarding effects  of cocaine (de  Wit  and  Wise,  1977;  Gawin  et  al.,  1989; Lieberman  et  al.,  1990;  Roberts  and  Koob,  1982;  Roberts et  al.,  1977;  Tsibulsky  et  al.,  1998;  Wise,  1995;  Wise  and Bozarth, 1987; Wise and Rompre, 1989). Cocaine  increases  5-HT  concentrations  in  Alo  terminals, NAcc,  after  single  administration (Bradberry  et  al.,  1993; Broderick  et  al.,  1993). Sensitized  5-HT  efflux  in  NAcc occurs  after  repeated  cocaine  administration (Parsons  and Justice,  1993) and  cocaine-increases  5-HT  release  induced by  electrical  stimulation  of  Alo  neurons,  in  vitro (Chen  and Reith,  1993). Importantly,  when  5-HT  concentrations  are deficient,  such  as  in  the  Fawn-Hooded  laboratory  rat, cocaine-induced  increases  in  5-HT  release  are  attenuated (Hope  et  al.,  1995). Consistent  with  increased  concentra­ tions  of  5-HT  after  cocaine,  cocaine  inhibits  5-HT  re-uptake in  vitro (Ross  and  Renyi,  1969) and  more  recent  studies have shown  that cocaine  inhibits 5-HT  re-uptake specifical­ ly  in  NAcc (Galloway,  1990). Also  consistent  with  in­ creased  concentrations  of  5-HT  after  cocaine,  cocaine represses  impulse  frequency  rates  in  vivo  and  in  vitro  in 5-HT  somatodendrites,  DR (Cunningham  and  Lakoski, 1988;  Pan  and  William,  1989). Furthermore,  5-HT-cocaine interactions  have  been  associated  with  transporter  mecha­ nisms (Carroll  et  al.,  1993;  Hall  et  al.,  2002;  Reith  et  al., 1983). Nonetheless,  a  precise  association  between  5-HT  and brain  reward  remains  to  be  determined.  Dietary  1-tryptophan,  a  5-HT  precursor,  and  fluoxetine,  a  5-HT  re-uptake inhibitor, have  been reported  to reduce  cocaine self-admin­ istration (Carroll  et  al.,  1990a,b;  McGregor  et  al.,  1993; Peltier  et  al.,  1994) and  depletion  of  forebrain  5-HT  with parachlorophenylalanine (P CPA) facilitate s cocaine  self-ad­ ministration (Loh  and  Roberts,  1990;  Richardson  and  Rob­ erts,  1991). However,  there  are  studies  that  are  discrepant 

from these previous studies (Porrino et al., 1989). Also, self­

stimulation  studies,  using  5-HT2a  antagonists  and  mixed DA2/5-HT2A  antagonists,  have  suggested  no  involvement between  5-HT2A,  brain  stimulation  and  cocaine  stimulation reward (Frank et  al., 1995;  Moser et  al., 1995;  Ramana and Desiraju,  1989;  Tsibulsky  et  al.,  1998). Particularly  relevant is  a  possible  interpretation  from  the  latter  studies  that atypical  antipsychotics  may  not  affect  the  regulation  of positive  affect  while  still  blocking  neurochemical  and  be­ havioral effects of cocaine, which may lead to psychosis.

1.5.  Cocaine,  monoamines  and  psychomotor  stimulant behavior

Intra-NAcc  infusions  of  cocaine  mimics  the  hyperlocomotor  effects  of  cocaine (Delfs  et  al.,  1990) and  the  DA mesolimbic  pathway  has  been  directly  implicated  in  the behavioral  effects  of  cocaine (Kalivas  and  Nemeroff, 

1988). Manipulations  of  5-HT  modulate  the  locomotor 

stimulant  effects  of  cocaine (Walsh  and  Cunningham, 

1997). Cocaine increases  5-HT in  DA mesolimbic  pathways 

simultaneously  with  increased  locomotion,  but  the  temporal pattern  is  disrupted  compared  with  5-HT  increases  with exploratory  activity (Broderick,  2001). Specific  5-HT  recep­ tor  mediation  has  been  shown  to  correlate  with  open-field locomotion,  e.g.,  local  application  of  5-HT  and  5-HT1A agonist,  8-OH-DPAT  into  median  raphe  nuclei  causes  hy­ peractivity (Hillegaart  et  al.,  1989) and  8-OH-DPAT,  has been  shown  to  up-modulate  cocaine-induced  psychostimu­ lant  behavior (De  La  Garza  and  Cunningham,  2000). Spe­ cific 5-HT2A and  5-HT2C receptor  mediation has  been shown to  correlate  with  cocaine-induced  hyperactivity (Filip  and Cunningham,  2002;  McMahon  and  Cunningham,  2001; McMahon et al., 2001).

1.6. Monoamine interactions, basis for cocaine mechanisms

Turnover  of  DA  is  altered  in  NAcc  when  the  5-HT 

somatodendrites, DR,  are electrolytically  lesioned and  these interactions  modulate  locomotion (Costall  et  al.,  1976, 

1990;  Herve  et  al.,  1979). Somatodendrites  for  DA,  VTA, contain  dense  networks  of  5-HT  axonal  varicosities (Bro­ derick  and  Phelix,  1997;  Herve  et  al.,  1987;  Steinbusch, 

1981; Van  Bockstaele et  al., 1994) and axons  in NAcc  core and  shell  exhibit  overlapping  of  tyrosine  hydroxylase  (TH) and  5-HT (Phelix  and  Broderick,  1995; Van  Bockstaele and Pickel, 1993).

1.7. Pharmacotherapies for psychoses

Pharmacotherapies  for  cocaine  psychosis  are  virtually nonexistent.  Thus  far,  clinicians  are  relying  for  therapy  on antipsychotic  medications  and  reasonably  so  because,  as mentioned  previously,  neurochemical  and  behavioral  simi­ larities e xist  between  schizophrenic  and  cocaine psychosis. Our  main  focus,  then,  is  also  in  treatment  strategies  for

cocaine  based  on  antipsychotics,  particularly  in  the  area  of atypical  antipsychotic  medications  due  to  their  dual  inter­ actions  on  dopamine  (DA)  and  serotonin  (5-HT)  in  DA neuronal  pathways  primarily  in  the  mesolimbic/mesocorticolimbic  Alo  neuronal  circuitry.  This  now  well-known  5HT2/DA2  receptor  affinity  in  the  Ai0  circuit  helps  to alleviate  both  positive  and  negative  symptoms  of  psychosis in addition  to being  mood enhancers (Meltzer, 1989,  1992). The leading hypothesis for  the mechanism of action  of these newer  generation,  atypical  antipsychotic  agents,  is  the presence  of  a  high  5-HT-DA  receptor  blockade  ratio  in mesolimbic  and  mesocorticolimbic  neural  circuits.  When  5HT-ergic  activity  is  blocked  as  is  the  case  with  many atypical  antipsychotics,  DA  inhibition  of  DA  release  is  also blocked,  consequently,  increasing  presynaptic  DA  release and  balancing  DA  blockade  at  postsynaptic  receptor  sites. The final result is less risk for EPS (Glazer, 2000).

1.8.  Clozapine

Clozapine  is  considered  to  be  the  prototype  of  the atypical  antipsychotics  as  it  was  the  first  to  be  recognized as  having  few  if  any  EPS,  not  causing  tardive  dyskinesia or  Parkinson’s  side  effects  including  dystonia (Lieberman et  al.,  1989;  Parsa  et  al.,  1991). It  is  interesting  that clozapine  is  not  generally  a  first  line  defense  drug  against 

schizophrenia,  but  clozapine  is  especially  effective  for treating  drug-resistant  schizophrenia,  when  typical  anti­ psychotics  have  failed  the  patient (Kane  et  al.,  1988; Ranjan  and  Meltzer,  1996). Clozapine  does  not  produce catalepsy (Kruzich  and  See,  2000). On  the  other  hand,  it is  well  known  that  clozapine  may  produce  agranulocytosis in  .0.5-2%  of  patients;  blood  serum  levels  must  be monitored  weekly  for  the  first  6  months.  Sedation  and weight  gain  are  limiting  factors  in  clozapine  treatment (Stahl, 2000).

The varied effects  of clozapine may  come about because the  receptor-binding  profile  for  clozapine  is  complex.  Clo­ zapine  binds  to  the  following  receptors:  5-HTiA,  5-HT2a,  5HT2C,  5-HT3,  5-HT6,  5-HT7,  DAb  DA2,  DA3,  DA4,  Mb Hb  ab  and  a2 (Brunello  et  al.,  1995;  Pere,  1995;  Schotte  et al., 1993,  1996; Stahl,  2000). Clozapine has  high affinity  for 

5HT2a  receptors  and  low  affinity  for  DA2  receptors (Melt­ zer,  1991,  1999;  Meltzer  and  Nash,  1991;  Meltzer  et  al., 

1992). Of  the  occupancy  ratios  for  atypical  antipsychotic medication,  clozapine  has  the  lowest  occupancy  for  DA2 receptors (Kapur  and  Remington,  2001;  Meltzer  et  al., 

1992).

1.9.  Clozapine/cocaine

Clozapine  is  an  excellent  candidate  to  test  reversal  of cocaine’s  effect,  not  only  because  of  low  DA  receptor occupancy which is thought to reduce EPS, but also because clozapine  is  prescribed  for  cocaine  addiction  with  reason­ able success, i.e., clozapine pretreatment diminishes subjec­

tive responses  to cocaine,  including expected  high and  rush 

responses (Farren  et  al.,  2000). In  another  study,  pretreat­

ment  with  clozapine  has  been  shown  to  alleviate  cocaine 

abuse  in  more  than  85%  of  active  substance  (cocaine) 

abusers (Zimmet et al., 2000).

**2.  Methods**

2.1. Drugs

Clozapine  was  obtained  from  Sigma  Aldrich,  St.  Louis, 

MO,  dissolved  in  distilled  water,  and  the  pH  of  the  solution 

was  adjusted  to  2.7  with  citric  acid  powder.  Cocaine  was 

obtained  from  Sigma  Aldrich,  and  dissolved  in  distilled 

water.

2.2. Animals

Animals  were  purchased  from  Charles  River  Laborato­

ries,  Kingston,  NY,  and  were  housed  in  our  animal  care 

facilities  for  1  to  2  weeks  before  surgery  was  performed. 

The Animal Care  Facility operates under  the auspices of  the 

CUNY,  City  College  Institutional  Animal  Care  and  Use 

Committee  (IACUC)  in  compliance  with  National  Institute 

of  Health  (NIH)  guidelines.  The  weight  range  for  the 

animals, at  the time  of the  studies, was  350-475 g.  Animals 

were group  housed before  surgery, individually  housed after 

surgery  and  fed  Purina  Rat  Chow  and  water  ad  libitum.  A 

12-h  dark-light  cycle  was  maintained  both  in  the  housing  of 

the animals and throughout the experimental studies.

2.3.  Surgical  procedures  and  implantation  of 

microelectrodes

2.3.1.  Protocols  follow  paradigm  described  in Broderick  et 

al. (2003)

Each animal  was anesthetized  with pentobarbital  Na, {50 

mg/kg  ip  [dilute  (6%)  solution]}  and  stereotaxically 

implanted  with  a  BRODERICK  PROBE®  indicator  micro­

electrode in  ventrolateral (vl)  NAcc (AP  + 2.6,  ML +  2.5, DV 

—  7.3)  (Pellegrino  et  al.,  1979).  The  stereotaxic  equipment 

was  purchased  from  David  Kopf  Instruments,  Tujunga,  CA. 

A  Ag/AgCl  reference  electrode  was  placed  in  contact  with 

dura,  7  mm  anteriorally  and  contralaterally  to  the  indicator 

microelectrode.  A  stainless  steel  auxiliary  microelectrode 

was  placed  in  contact  with  dura.  BRODERICK  PROBE® 

microelectrodes were manufactured on site.

Animals’  body  temperature  was  continuously  monitored 

with  a  rectal  probe  and  thermometer  (Fisher  Sci.,  Fadem, 

NJ). Body  temperature was maintained at 37.5  ± 0.5 °C  with 

an  aquamatic  K  module  heating  pad  (Amer.  Hosp.  Supply, 

Edison,  NJ).  Booster  injections  of  pentobarbital  Na  were 

administered once after  the first 2  h of surgery  (0.10 cc) and 

once  every  subsequent  hour  (0.05  cc)  to  maintain  an 

adequate  level  of  anesthesia  throughout  surgery.  The  total

time  for  surgery  was  3-4  h.  The  indicator,  reference,  and auxiliary  microelectrodes  were  held  in  place  with  dental acrylic  (Jet  Line,  Lang  Dental,  CA).  Animals  recovered  in  a bedded  Plexiglas  cage  [dimensions:  12x12x18  in. (width x depth  x height)] after  surgery and before  the exper­ imental  studies  began,  with  food  and  water  ad  libitum.  The animals  were  treated  with  physiological  saline  (0.5  cc) immediately  and  for  1-2  days  after  surgery  as  needed. The  antibiotic,  chloramphenicol  (50  mg/kg  ip)  was  admin­ istered if needed. In  vivo  microvoltammetric  studies  on  conscious  Spra­ gue-Dawley  laboratory  rats  were  begun  9-15  days  after  the aseptic surgical operations were performed. On each exper­ imental  day,  the  animal  was  placed  in  a  Plexiglas-copper faradaic  chamber.  The  three-microelectrode  assembly, enclosed  within  the  animal’s  prosthetic  acrylic  cap,  was connected  to  a  CV37  detector  by  means  of  a  mercury commutator (Br.  Res. Instr.,  Princeton, NJ),  a flexible  cable, and  a  mating  connector  (BJM  Electronics,  Staten  Island, NY).  The  CV37  detector  was  electrically  connected  to  a Minigard  surge  suppresser  (Jefferson  Electric,  Magnetek, NY),  which  was  then  connected  to  an  electrical  ground  in isolation.  Stable  electrochemical  signals  for  DA  and  5-HT were  evident  before  either  (i)  clozapine  (20  mg/kg  ip),  (ii) cocaine  (10  mg/kg  ip)  or  (iii)  combination  of  clozapine  and cocaine  (20  and  10  mg/kg  ip,  respectively)  were  adminis­ tered. Each  animal was  used as  its own  control. Changes  in synaptic  concentrations  of  DA  and  5-HT  are  presented  as percent  change  (percent  of  control)  to  minimize  normal between-animal  variations.  Currents  recorded  were  in  the order  of  magnitude  of  pA  or  nA.  In  vivo  microvoltammetric scans were recorded in seconds and repeated every 5 min for a period of 2 h before each treatment and a period of 2 h after each treatment.

2.4.  In vivo microvoltammetry: technology

In  Vivo  Microvoltammetry  with  a  semidifferential  (semi­ derivative)  circuit  was  used;  a  clear  separation  of  the monoamine  neurotransmitters,  DA  and  5-HT  was a chieved. Dopamine  and  5-HT  were  detected  within  seconds  in separate  signals.  Oxidation  peak  potentials  (half-wave potentials)  of  +0.14  ±0.015  and  +0.29  ±0.015  V  were characteristic  for  DA  and  5-HT.  Detailed  methodology  is published (Broderick,  1988,  1989,  1990,  1991b,  1999, 2001,  2002;  Broderick  and  Pacia,  2003;  Broderick  et  al., 1993,  2000). The  electrochemical  signal  for  DA,  was detected  without  interference  at  the  same  oxidation  poten­ tial,  from  3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic  acid  (DOPAC),  homo­ vanillic  acid  (HVA)  and  ascorbic  acid  (AA).  Indeed,  clear and  separated  signals  are  routinely  achieved  with  BRO­ DERICK  PROBE®  microelectrodes  for  AA,  HVA  and DOPAC.  The  electrochemical  signal  for  5-HT  was  detected without  interference  at  the  same  oxidation  potential,  from the  5-HT  metabolite,  5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA) and  uric  acid  (UA).  Potentials  were  applied  with  a  CV37 

detector  (BAS,  West  Lafayette,  IN).  Potentials  were  applied from  —0.2  V  to  +0.4  V  with  respect  to  a  Ag/AgCl  (1  M NaCl) electrode, at  a scan rate  of 10 mV/s  at time constants of  5  and  1  s  tau.  One  scan  was  completed  in  60  s. Nonfaradaic  charging  current  was  eliminated  in  the  first 25 s.  The neurotransmitters,  DA and  5-HT, were d etected in approximately  10-15  and  10-12  s,  respectively,  with BRODERICK  PROBE®  stearic  scid  microelectrodes  and 

10-12  and  8-10  s,  respectively,  with  BRODERICK PROBE®  lauric  acid  microelectrodes.  The  coulombic  effi­ ciency  for  the  detection  of  5-HT  was  two-  to  threefold greater than that for DA (Broderick, 1987).

Calibration  curves  were  determined  experimentally,  in vitro,  in  a  freshly  prepared  deoxygenated  physiological 

saline-phosphate  buffer  solution  (0.01  M,  pH  =  7.4).  We use  ultra  pure  nitrogen  (N2)  (T.W.  Smith  Corp.,  Brooklyn, NY)  to  deoxygenate  the  buffer  solution.  Solutions  of  DA and  5-HT  (99%  purity,  Sigma  Aldrich)  as  well  as  metabo­ lites  of  the  monoamines,  were  aliquoted  into  the  buffer  and the  peak  height  of  the  electrochemical  signals  were  corre­ lated  with  specific  nM  and  pM  concentrations.  Calibration 

studies were  also performed  in freshly  prepared deoxygen­ ated  buffer  solutions  containing  phosphotidylethanolamine (PEA),  combined  with  bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA)  (Sigma Aldrich),  a  solution  which  closely  mimics  brain  constitu­ ents.  These  studies  showed  that  lipid  constituents  of  brain and  not  proteins,  amplify  the  detection  sensitivity  of  the indicator  microelectrodes,  supporting  previous  data  which 

show that  lipids amplify  electrochemical signals  detected by BRODERICK  PROBE®  microelectrodes;  the  phenomenon is  termed  The  Lipid  Amplification  Number  (LAN) (Broder­ ick, 1999; Broderick  et al., 2000). Surface Enhanced Raman 

Spectroscopy (SERS)  and Raman  Resonance (RR)  techni­ ques have  correlated our  findings on  signal amplification  by lipids (Foucault  et  al.,  2002). Detection  limits  for  basal 

synaptic  concentrations  of  DA  and  5-HT  in  NAcc  were  12 and  2  nM,  respectively.  Placement  of  indicator  microelectrodes  in  NAcc  of  each  animal,  was  confirmed  by  the potassium  ferrocyanide  blue  dot  method,  using  a  current of  50  mA  for  period  of  30  s.  Virtually  no  damage  to  brain tissue  occurred.  Recording  characteristics  of  microelectro­ des were stable.

2.5.  Behavior

Locomotor  activity  (ambulation)  was  monitored  with infrared  photobeams  at  the  same  time  as  DA  and  5-HT release  in  NAcc  was  detected  with  the  BRODERICK PROBE®  in  conjunction  with  In  Vivo  Microvoltammetry. The  chamber  was  faradaic,  covered  with  copper  to  refract possible  electrical  artifacts  [dimensions:  24  x  18  x  23.5  in. (width  x  depth  x  height)].  A  16  x  16  array  of  these  infrared photobeams,  were  held  in  place  by  an  aluminum  frame which  was  situated  3/4  in  above  the  Plexiglas  floor  of  the chamber  to  detect  locomotor  activity.  Photobeams  were 

sampled  by  a  Pentium  computer  to  define  the x-y  position

of the  animal within  a 1.5  in resolution  every 100  ms. When an x-y  position  was  calculated,  it  was  used  to  define  the frequency  of  locomotor  activity  in  counts.  The  locomotor activity  system  is  a  modified  version  of  an  Activity  Pattern Monitor  (APM)  (San  Diego  Instruments,  San  Diego,  CA). Behavioral  data  are  presented  in  absolute  frequency,  i.e., number of counts recorded.

The  first  hour  predrug  allowed  exploratory  behavior. Exploratory  behavior  is  defined  as  open-field  behavior  of ambulations  (forward  locomotion)  wherein  animals  re­

spond  to  the  stimuli  of  a  novel  environment  with  high frequency  of  behavioral  counts.  The  second  hour  predrug allowed  the  animal  to  become  habituated  before  treatment. Habituation  behavior  is  defined  as  a  behavioral  state  in which  behavior  exhibits  reduced  responses  to  novel  stim­ uli;  animals  cease  exploring  or  searching  in  their  novel environment  and  maintain a ste ady-state  response  to novel 

stimuli.

In  the  acute  studies,  each  drug  was  administered  at  the end of the  habituation period. Baseline  (control) values were taken  every  5  min  for  the  last  30  min  of  the  habituation period  at  which  time  drug  injection(s)  took  place.  Electro­ chemical recordings  for DA  and 5-HT  release in  NAcc, were continued  for  2  h;  at  the  same  time,  locomotor  behavior continued  to  be  monitored  and  recorded  with  infrared photobeams.  At  the  end  of  the  2  h  drug(s)  study,  animals were then placed back in their home cages.

In  the  subacute  studies,  which  took p lace  24 h  later, the animals  were  again  placed  in  the  faradaic  behavioral chamber and  no further  drug was  administered. Recordings of  separate  electrochemical  signals  for  DA  and  5-HT release  in  NAcc,  were  taken  for  1  h;  at  the  same  time, locomotor  behavior  was  monitored  and  recorded  with infrared photobeams.

2.6.  Data analysis

Neurochemical and  behavioral data,  derived from the  last 30 min of  the habituation period,  provided the baseline d ata. 

Statistically  significant  differences  between  baseline  and postdrug  injection(s)  for  (1)  DA  (2)  5-HT  and  (3)  locomotor behavior were determined  by subjecting the data  to one-way analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  (tested  at  criteria  Z3  =.05), with  subsequent  application  of  the  post  hoc  test,  Tukey’s Multiple Comparison  Test; where  appropriate, data  points in the  time  course  were  subjected  to  95%  confidence  limits (C.L.).

**3.  Results**

3.1.  Day  1:  acute  studies:  Effects  of  cocaine  or  clozapine/ cocaine combination on DA release in NAcc

Cocaine  (open  circles):  Cocaine  significantly  increased DA release over baseline (habituation) values (one-way

ANOVA:  P<.0001;  F=51.17;  #=3,56).  Post  hoc  analysis 

showed  that  significant  differences  between  precocaine 

(baseline)  and  postcocaine  (same  animal  control)  occurred 

as  well  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Comparison  Test:  P<.001, 

q =  9.498).

cantly  blocked  the  effects  of  cocaine  on  DA  release  (one­

way  ANOVA:  P<.0001;  F=51.17;  #=3,56).  Post  hoc 

analysis showed significant differences between cocaine and 

clozapine/cocaine  groups  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Comparison 

Test: P< .001, q= 16.43) (seeFig. 1A).

5-HT  release  over  baseline  (habituation)  values  (one-way 

ANOVA:  P<.0001; F=  154.2;  #=3,56).  Post  hoc  analysis 

showed  that  significant  differences  between  precocaine 

(baseline)  and  postcocaine  (same  animal  control)  occurred 

as  well  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Comparison  Test:  P<.001,

cantly  blocked  the  effects  of  cocaine  on  5-HT  release 

(one-way  ANOVA:  P<.0001; F=  154.2;  #=3,56).  Post 

hoc analysis showed significant differences between cocaine 

and  clozapine/cocaine  groups  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Compari­

son Test: P<.001, q = 28.98) (see Fig. IB).

3.3.  Day  1:  acute  studies:  effects  of  cocaine  and  clozapine/ 

cocaine combination on locomotion (ambulations)

Cocaine  (open  circles):  Cocaine  significantly  increased 

locomotor  activity  (ambulations)  over  baseline  (habituation) 

values  (one-way  ANOVA:  P<.0001; F=  13.06;  #=3,56). 

Post  hoc  analysis  showed  that  significant  differences  be­

tween  precocaine  (baseline)  and  postcocaine  (same a nimal 

control)  occurred  as  well  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Comparison 

Test: P<.01, q = 5.688).

Clozapine/cocaine  (closed  circles):  Clozapine  signifi­

cantly  blocked  the  effects  of  cocaine  on  locomotor  activity 

(one-way  ANOVA:  P<.0001, F=  13.06;  #=3,56).  Post 

hoc analysis showed significant differences between cocaine 

and  clozapine/cocaine  groups  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Compari­

son Test: P<.001, ? = 7.784) (Fig. 1C).

3.4.  Day  2:  subacute  studies:  effects  of  cocaine  or 

clozapine/cocaine combination on DA release in NAcc

Cocaine  (open  circles):  During  the  subacute  studies, 

when  no  further  cocaine  was  administered,  DA  release  in 

NAcc  significantly  decreased  from  baseline  (habituation) 

values  (from  a  significant  increase)  (one-way  ANOVA: 

P<.0001; F=  106.3;  #=3,30).  Post  hoc  analysis  showed 

that  significant  differences  occurred  between  baseline  (Day 

1) and (Day 2) values (same animal control) (Tukey’s

3.5.  Day  2:  subacute  studies:  effects  of  cocaine  or 

clozapine/cocaine combination on 5-HT release in NAcc

Cocaine  (open  circles):  During  the  subacute  studies, when  no  further  cocaine  was  administered,  5-HT  release 

in  NAcc  was  decreased  below  baseline  (Day  1)  values 

compared  to  (Day  2)  values,  at  specific  time  points  during the time course of t he 1-h study, i.e., at  the 15-min mark and 

at each time  point in second  part of the  hour (P< .05); (one­ way  ANOVA:  P<.0001; F=  38.99;  #=3,30),  although  the post hoc ana lysis did not  show statistical significance  for the hour  (Tukey’s  Multiple  Comparison  Test:  P>.05, 

<7 = 3.225). Compared to drug effect on Day 1, 5-HT release was  decreased  dramatically  by  approximately  150%  in  the 

second half hour of the study.

Clozapine/cocaine  (closed  circles):  During  the  subacute

There  was  no  significant  difference  in DA  effects  between  subacute  cocaine  and  clozapine/cocaine  groups (P>.05).

On  Day  2,  in  the cocaine  group (n  =  5),5-HT  decreased  from  baseline  at  the  15-min  mark and  during  the  second  part  of  the  1-h  time  course  (P<  .05),  likely  reflecting 5-HT-related  cocaine  withdrawal  effects.  However,  in  the  clozapine/cocaine group (n  =  6),5-HT  increased  above  baseline  (P<.001).  There  was  a significant  difference  between  subacute  cocaine  versus  clozapine/cocaine groups  (P<.001).  The  data  suggest  that  clozapine,  which  has  a  longer pharmacokinetic  half-life  than  does  cocaine,  may  have  reversed  the  5-HT- related  withdrawal  effects  of  cocaine.

There  was  a  significant  difference  between  subacute  values  in  the cocaine  group  versus  the  clozapine/cocaine  group  (P<.05).

In all groups, additional saline controls had no effect.

**4.  Discussion**

4.1.  Cocaine,  monoamines  and  psychomotor  stimulant behavior: acute studies

We  have  extended  our  work  from  two  recent  articles  on the  effects  of  cocaine  on  DA  and  5-HT  release  in  NAcc  of freely  moving  and  behaving  laboratory  rats  WHILE  moni­ toring  cocaine-induced  psychomotor  stimulant  behavior 

simultaneously.  Comparing  the  present  data  to  the  first  of these recent papers (Broderick et al.,  2003), we have simply added animals to  our cocaine group.  Comparing the present data  to  the  second  of  these  recent  papers (Broderick  and Piercey,  1998b), an  entirely  different  group  of  animals  was utilized.  The  results  from  all  three  studies  from  our  labora­ tory  were  equivalent,  i.e.,  increased  DA,  5-HT  release  in NAcc  occurred  with  increased  psychomotor  stimulant  be­ havior (Broderick,  2001;  Broderick  and  Piercey,  1998b; Broderick et al., 2003).

4.2.  Cocaine,  monoamines  and  psychomotor  stimulant behavior: subacute studies

Cocaine studies in the subacute group were also extended by increasing the number of animals above what was used in our  previous  studies (Broderick  et  al.,  2003); again,  the results were equiva lent. When no  further drug was  adminis­ tered, there was a significant decrease in DA release in NAcc and  significant  decreases  in  5-HT  release  during  specific points  in  the  time  course  data.  The  data  are  in  agreement with  several  reports (Broderick  et  al.,  1997;  Parsons  et  al., 

1995,1996). In addition, the data agree with a previous report 

showing long-last ing effects  after a  single moderate  dose of cocaine (Zahniser  et  al.,  1988). Behavioral  activity  main­ tained an increase at the same time that accumbens DA and 5HT release were  decreased, thereby suggesting  dissociative function between  behavior classically  known to  be mediated via  DA2  postsynaptically  and  monoamine  release  and  re­ uptake inhibitory mechanisms, presynaptically.

The  subacute  data  suggest  that  these  monoamine  defi­

ciencies  may  be  associated  with  symptoms  of  withdrawal 

and the  data agree  with clinical  reports of  DA-ergic systems 

and  craving (Dackis  and  Gold,  1985;  Gawin  and  Kleber, 

1986a,b;  Lieberman  et  al.,  1990;  Margolin  et  al.,  1995). 

Neuroadaptation  may  be  occurring  as  reported  in  animal 

studies (Broderick,  2001; Koob and  Nestler, 1 997) because 

neither  the  short  pharmacokinetic  half-life  of  cocaine  nor 

that  of  its  metabolites,  provides  a  rational  explanation 

(Misra  et  al.,  1974a,b;  Nayak  et  al.,  1976;  Mets  et  al., 

1999;  Sun  and  Lau,  2001). Of  course,  another  plausible 

explanation though,  is one  provided by  others, that  transient 

compensatory changes  take place  a day  after cocaine  ces­

sation (Zahniser et al., 1988).

4.3.  Cocaine, monoamine interactions, possible mechanisms

Classical  cocaine  mechanisms  point  to  a  postsynaptic 

DA 2   release  with  additional  DA  release  derived  presynap­

tically  from  DA  somatodendrites,  VTA.  Current  thinking 

on  the  mechanism  of  action  of  cocaine  points  to  a  DA/5-

HT  interaction  in  DA  mesolimbic  circuits.  A  postsynaptic 

5-HT-ergic  up-modulation  of  DA  in  NAcc  has  been  impli­

cated;  the  5-HT2A/2C  receptor  has  been  shown  to  up-

modulate  DA  release  in  NAcc  after  intermittent  cocaine 

(Yan  et  al.,  2000) and  endogenously,  as  well (Yan,  2000). 

Local  application  (infusion)  of  [(±  )-2,5-dimethoxy-4-

iodoamphetamine  hydrochloride]  (DOI),  a  5-HT2A/2c  ago­

nist,  was  infused  into  NAcc  to  increase  DA  which  was 

subsequently  blocked  by  ketanserin,  a  5-HT2A/2C  antago­

nist.  Furthermore,  infusion  of  DOI  in  NAcc  was  antago­

nized  by  the  selective  5-HT2C/2b  receptor  antagonist,  SB 

206553,  but  not  by  the  selective  5-HT2a  antagonist,  SR 

46349B (Lucas and  Spampinato, 2000), suggesting that  DA 

increases  in  NAcc  after  infusion  of  DOI  may  be  due  to  a 

mediation by the 5-HT2c receptor.

However,  prematurely  pointing  specifically  to  the  5-

HT 2 c  receptor  for  cocaine’s  mechanism  of  action  may 

present  a  limitation  because  local  application  (infusion  into 

NAcc)  of  5-HT2c  receptor  agonists  did  not  alter  basal 

locomotor  activity  nor  mimic  the  stimulus  effects  of  cocaine 

(Filip  and Cu nningham,  2002; M cMahon  et  al., 2001). Also, 

a  recent  report  shows  that  a  5-HT2A  receptor  mediation  is 

prominent  in  blocking  cocaine-induced  locomotor  activity 

(McMahon  and  Cunningham,  2001). Therefore,  the  mech­

anism  of  action  of  cocaine  is  probably  dually  directed,  i.e., 

via  classical  DA2  and  currently  explored  5-HT2A/2C/DA2 

receptor circuits.

Although  studies  by Di  Matteo  et  al.  (1999), do  not 

address  cocaine,  the  data  do  importantly  show  the  direct 

autoreceptor  properties  of  selective  5-HT2C  receptor  com­

pounds  vis-a-vis  the  effects  of  these  compounds  when 

locally  applied  by  infusion.  Thus,  the  selective  5-HT2C 

antagonist,  SB  242084,  increased  and  the  selective  5-

HT 2 c  agonist,  RO  60-0175,  decreased  DA  release  in  NAcc 

(Di Matteo et al., 1999).

4.4.  Clozapine/cocaine: acute studies

Clozapine  significantly  reduced  cocaine-induced increases  in  DA  release  in  NAcc  by  an  average  of  40% in  the  first  hour  of  study  and  50%  in  the  second  hour  of 

study.  Simultaneously,  clozapine  significantly  reduced cocaine-induced  increases  in  5-HT  release  in  NAcc  by an  average  of  138%  in  the  first  hour  of  study  and  average of  113%  in  the  second  hour  of  study.  Also,  at  the  same time,  locomotor  activity  (ambulation  counts)  produced  by cocaine,  were  reduced  by  an  average  of  500  counts  in  the first  half  hour  and  by  an  average  of  150  counts  in  the  next hour  of  study.  Since  these  are  the  first  studies  of  this  kind ever  performed,  direct  comparisons  cannot  be  made. Nonetheless,  the  present  studies  are  in  general  agreement with  preclinical  studies  in  which  clozapine  was  shown  to antagonize  cocaine-induced  place  preference  in  animals (Kosten  and  Nestler,  1994) and  to  block  reinforcement by intravenous cocaine in animals (Loh et al., 1992).

4.5.  Clozapine/cocaine:  possible  mechanisms  of  action: acute studies

The  data  suggest  that  increased  5-HT  by  cocaine  leads to  an  increase  in  DA  release  perhaps  via  either  a  separate or  combined  5-HT2A/2c  receptor  mediation,  which  is 

subsequently  blocked  by  clozapine.  This  suggestion  is made  because  of  previous  reports  of  the  importance  of 

5-HT2a/2c  receptors  either  alone  or  combined  in  cocaine mechanisms (Filip  and  Cunningham,  2002;  McMahon  and Cunningham,  2001;  Yan,  2000;  Yan  et  al.,  2000) and because  clozapine  is,  in  fact,  the  prototypical  atypical  5HT2a/DA2  receptor  antagonist,  although  not  exclusively bound  to  these  two  types  of  receptors.  Clozapine  has  high antagonist  affinity  for  the  5-HT2C  receptor  and  indeed, phosphoinositol  inverse  agonist  activity  at  the  5-HT2C receptor (Herrick-Davis  et  al.,  1999,  2000;  Kuoppamaki et  al.,  1995) has  been  shown  specifically  in  NAcc,  in  the action  of  clozapine (Di  Matteo  et  al.,  2002). Classical  DA2 postsynaptic  antagonism  of  cocaine-induced  psychomotor 

stimulant  behavior  by  clozapine  probably  accounts,  at  least in  part,  for  the  complete  blockade  of  motor  activity observed.  Interestingly,  in  the  apomorphine-induced  hypo­ motility  test,  clozapine  did  not  antagonize  this  presynaptic response,  unlike  the  DA2/3  antipsychotic  agent,  sulpiride (Robertson and MacDonald, 1986).

A  mediation  by  5-HT2A/2c  receptors  in  the  mechanism  of action  for  clozapine’s  blockade  of  cocaine,  is  also  further 

suggested. In  acute studies  performed in  this laboratory,  we 

substituted (3  mg/kg sc)  ketanserin, a  5-HT2A/2c antagonist, for  clozapine  and  the  results  were  remarkably  similar  to clozapine  in  blocking  cocaine-induced  monoamine  release and  psychomotor  stimulant  behavior,  although  ketanserin blockade  of  cocaine  was  actually  weaker  than  that  of clozapine in all three parameters studied (Broderick et al., 2001).

Ketanserin  and  clozapine  do  not  have  similar  receptor 

profiles,  in  general,  but  ketanserin  is  similar  to  clozapine  in 

that  both  are  direct  receptor  antagonists  which  bind  with 

high  affinity  to  5-HT2A,  5-HT2C,  adrenergic  (cti)  and 

histamine  (HJ  receptors;  ketanserin  does  not  have  bind  to 

DA  receptors (Duffy  et  al.,  2000;  Lutje  Hulsik,  2002). The 

strong ct | influence  is a concern, but  there is good evidence 

that  only  5-HT2A/2c  receptors  are involved  and ct)  adrenor­

eceptors  are  not  involved  in  the  mechanism  of  cocaine’s 

stimulant  activity (Filip  et  al.,  2001). The  high  antagonist 

affinity  for  Hi  receptors  on  the  part  of  both  ketanserin  and 

clozapine,  is  probably  not  a  concern.  Studies  on  H!  and 

even  H 2  promoter  polymorphisms  conclude  that  participa­

tion  of  these  receptors  have  an  unlikely  influence  in  the 

clinical response to clozapine treatment (Mancama et al.,

2002) . Thus,  5-HT2A/2c  properties  for  clozapine  are  highly 

likely  mechanisms  for  clozapine’s  antagonism  of  cocaine 

effects.

It  is  interesting  that  studies  on  risperidone’s  effects  on 

cocaine-induced  stimulant  monoamine  neurochemistry  and 

locomotor  behavior,  showed  that  risperidone  completely 

blocked  5-HT  release  in  NAcc  and  simultaneous  locomotor 

activity  but  did  not  completely  block  DA  release  on  NAcc. 

Indeed,  risperidone  significantly  increased  DA  release  in 

the  second  hour  of  the  study,  given  the  caveat  that  high 

dose risperidone (2 mg/kg sc) was tested (Broderick et al.,

2003) .

4.6.  Clozapine/cocaine: subacute studies

Results  showed  that  DA  release  in  NAcc,  at  this  time, 

decreased  by  an  average  of  60%  during  the  hour  of  study, 

while  5-HT  release  increased  by  50%  above  baseline  for 

the  hour  of  study  and  locomotor  activity  remained  re­

duced  by  an  average  of  250  ambulatory  counts  in  the  first 

20 min.

It  is  important  to  note  that  these  long  lasting  effects  of 

clozapine  are  supported  by  pharmacokinetics.  The  half-life 

of clozapine is 8 h at lower doses and 4-66 h at higher doses; 

the  hydroxlated  and  N-oxide  derivatives  are  reported  to  be 

inactive (Clinical  Pharmacology  of  Clozapine,  2002). Inter­

estingly,  preliminary  data  from  our  laboratory  have  shown 

that  significantly  increased  5-HT  release  after  combined 

clozapine/cocaine administration,  does not  begin to  diminish 

until the fifth day of recovery after drug administration.

4.7.  Clozapine/cocaine:  possible  mechanisms  of  action: 

subacute studies

The  occurrence  of  increased  5-HT  release  in  subacute 

studies may be explained by clozapine’ s mechanism than by 

cocaine’s  mechanism.  If  we  look  at  clozapine,  5-HT  pre­

synaptic  autoreceptors,  as  studied  in  synaptosomes,  may 

lend an  explanatory note (Drescher and  Hetey, 1988). Also, 

presumably by  autoreceptors, clozapine  increased DA  efflux 

in  NAcc (Kuroki  et  al.,  1999;  Volonte  et  al.,  1997), DA  and

5-HT  release  in  NAcc  in  the  behaving  animal  (Broderick  et al.,  unpublished  data; Ichikawa  et  al., 1998) and DA  and 5HT  release  in  NAcc  in  the  anesthetized  animal (Broderick and Piercey,  1998a). Therefore, increased  5-HT release,  as shown  in  these  subacute  studies,  may  be  mediated  by inhibitory  presynaptic  autoreceptors.  The  explanation  for decreased  DA  release  is  not  apparent,  unless  this  DA decrease  is  simply  compensatory (Beart  and  McDonald, 1982; Herve et al., 1979). Moreover,  increased  5-HT  release  on  the  second  day  of study  might  possibly  have  been  derived  from  increased cocaine  serum  levels  due  to  the  longer  lasting  effects  of clozapine  since  a  clinical  study  reported  enhanced  cocaine serum  levels  after  administration  of  both  clozapine  and cocaine  to  cocaine  addicts (Farren  et  al.,  2000). It  is noteworthy  that  increased  5-HT  release  on  the  second  day of  study,  did  not  occur  in  a  risperidone/cocaine  group (Broderick et al., 2003). Thus far,  research in  our laboratory  suggests that  cloza­ pine’s  action  on  cocaine  is  mediated  at  least  partly,  via  5HT2A/2C receptors  because the results  presented here, fr om clozapine/cocaine  combination  studies,  resemble  those obtained  during  subacute  studies  when  substituting  the  5HT2a/2c  antagonist,  ketanserin  for  clozapine.  In  subacute studies  with  ketanserin/cocaine,  when  no  further  ketanserin or cocaine was administered, DA release  in NAcc decreased and 5-HT  increased to  a statistically  significant level,  just as did results, subacutely, in the clozapine/cocaine group. There  were  some  differences  in  monoamine  reactions during the  subacute studies  between the  ketanserin/cocaine group  and  the  clozapine/cocaine  group,  e.g.,  the  DA  re­ sponse w as weaker  and the  5-HT response  was somewhat stronger.  Notably,  locomotor  activity  was  significantly higher  on  the  second  day  for  the  ketanserin/cocaine  group vis-a-vis  the  clozapine/cocaine  group.  The  clozapine/co­ caine  group  continued  to  exhibit  sedation,  possibly  through residual  potent,  muscarinic  anticholinergic  receptor  media­ tion (Richelson and Souder, 2000; Broderick et al., 2001). On the  other hand,  the atypical  antipsychotic medication, the  5-HT2A/DA2  receptor  antagonist,  risperidone,  did  not exhibit  subacute  responses  to  cocaine  as  did  clozapine.  In fact,  DA  and  5-HT  release  returned  to  baseline  and  loco­ motor  activity  increased  insignificantly  above  baseline (Broderick  et  al.,  2003). It  is  noteworthy  however,  that studies with  the high  dose of  risperidone (2  mg/kg sc)  were performed (Broderick  et  al.,  2003). High  dose  risperidone exhibits  more  typical  than  atypical  antipsychotic  properties (Williams, 2001). Not  to  be  neglected,  though,  is  a  possible  mediation  by the  5-HTiA  receptor  because  clozapine  exhibits  moderate receptor  binding  for  the  5-HTiA  receptor (Schotte  et  al., 1993,  1996;  Sumiyoshi  et  al.,  1995). Importantly,  the  5HT1a receptor  has been  shown clinically  to mediate  schizo­ phrenic  psychosis (Chou  et  al.,  2003) and  preclinically,  to mediate  the  action  of  DA  in  NAcc (Ichikawa  and  Meltzer, 2000). Finally,  cti  antagonism  has  been  shown  to  mediate 

inhibition  of  dorsal  raphe  (DR)  firing  by  clozapine  through 

5-HT 1A receptors (Sprouse et al., 1999).

**5.  Conclusions**

Acute studies  showed that  clozapine blocked  accumbens DA,  5-HT  and  locomotor  effects  of  cocaine.  These  studies 

are  the  first  of  their  kind.  The  subacute  studies  are  also unique; the  subacute studies  allowed us  to study  withdrawal 

effects of  cocaine in  addition to  the unexpected  long-lasting 

effects  of  clozapine/cocaine  treatment  on  accumbens  DA 

and 5-HT release  in the freely  moving and behaving  animal. Enhanced  5-HT  release  may  help  alleviate  clinical  depres­

sion associated  with cocaine  withdrawal (Price et  al., 2001), 

although  decreased  DA  release  could  be  a  disadvantage, possibly  leading  to  craving (Dackis  and  Gold,  1985). Nonetheless, critical  treatment strategies  for cocaine  addic­ tion and psychosis could be derived from these results.
