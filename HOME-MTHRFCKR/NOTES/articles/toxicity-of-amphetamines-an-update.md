**Abstract** Amphetamines  represent  a  class  of  psychotro­ pic  compounds,  widely  abused  for  their  stimulant,  eupho­ ric,  anorectic,  and,  in  some  cases,  emphathogenic, entactogenic,  and  hallucinogenic  properties.  These  com­ pounds  derive  from  the  /Lphenylethylamine  core  structure and  are  kinetically  and  dynamically  characterized  by  easily crossing  the  blood-brain  barrier,  to  resist  brain  biotransformation  and  to  release  monoamine  neurotransmitters from  nerve  endings.  Although  amphetamines  are  widely acknowledged  as  synthetic  drugs,  of  which  amphetamine, methamphetamine,  and  3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  (MDMA,  ecstasy)  are  well-known  examples, humans  have  used  natural  amphetamines  for  several  mil­ lenniums,  through  the  consumption  of  amphetamines  pro­ duced in  plants, namely  cathinone (khat),  obtained from  the plant  Catha  edulis  and  ephedrine,  obtained  from  various plants in  the genus  Ephedra. More  recently, a  wave of  new amphetamines  has  emerged  in  the  market,  mainly  consti­ tuted  of  cathinone  derivatives,  including  mephedrone, methylone,  methedrone,  and  buthylone,  among  others. Although  intoxications  by  amphetamines  continue  to  be common  causes  of  emergency  department  and  hospital admissions,  it  is  frequent  to  find  the  sophism  that amphetamine  derivatives,  namely  those  appearing  more recently, are relatively safe. However, human intoxications

by  these  drugs  are  increasingly  being  reported,  with  similar patterns  compared  to  those  previously  seen  with  classical amphetamines.  That  is  not  surprising,  considering  the 

similar  structures  and  mechanisms  of  action  among  the different  amphetamines,  conferring  similar  toxicokinetic and  toxicological  profiles  to  these  compounds.  The  aim  of the  present  review  is  to  give  an  insight  into  the  pharma­ cokinetics,  general  mechanisms  of  biological  and  toxico­ logical  actions,  and  the  main  target  organs  for  the  toxicity of  amphetamines.  Although  there  is  still  scarce  knowledge from novel  amphetamines to  draw mechanistic  insights, the long-studied  classical  amphetamines—amphetamine  itself, as  well  as  methamphetamine  and  MDMA,  provide  plenty of  data  that  may  be  useful  to  predict  toxicological  outcome to  improvident  abusers  and  are  for  that  reason  the  main focus of this review.

Amphetamines are  psychoactive substances  with stimulant, 

euphoric,  anorectic,  and,  in  some  cases,  emphathogenic, 

entactogenic,  and  hallucinogenic  properties.  The  com­

pounds  with  amphetaminic  structure  derive  from  the 

/J-phenylethylamine  core  structure  (Fig. 1) and  are  kineti­

cally  and  dynamically  characterized  by  easily  crossing  the 

blood-brain  barrier,  to  resist  brain  biotransformation  and  to 

release  monoamine  neurotransmitters  from  nerve  endings. 

All  the  structural  features  that  enable  these  physiological 

characteristics  are  present  in  the  simplest  derivative, 

amphetamine  (AMPH)  (Fig. 1). In  fact,  the  presence  of  the 

a-methyl  group  on  the  AMPH  molecule  prevents  the  oxi­

dation  of  the  amine  group  by  monoamine  oxidase  (MAO) 

enzymes  and  increases  the  ability  to  cross  membranes 

that  is  enabled  by  their  amphipathic  nature  (Young  and 

Glennon 1986). In  addition,  due  to  the  structural  similarity 

with  monoamine  neurotransmitters,  amphetamines  act  as 

competitive  substrates  at  the  membrane  transporters 

of noradrenaline (NAT), dopamine (DAT), and serotonin

**Fig.  1** Chemical  structures  of  /J-phenylethylamine (numbered)  and amphetamine,  as  well  as  of  the  natural  amphetamines  ephedroxane, pseudoephedrine,  ephedrine,  cathinone,  norpseudoephedrine  (cathine), and norephedrine (phenylpropanolamine)

(5-HTT;  SERT),  reducing  the  reuptake  of  endogenous neurotransmitters,  and  inducing  the  reverse  transport  of endogenous  neurotransmitters,  and  hence  non-exocytotic neurotransmitter  release.  Amphetamines  also  promote dopamine  (DA)  and  serotonin  (5-HT)  release  from  storage vesicles  and  prevent  the  uptake  into  vesicles,  thus increasing  the  cytoplasmic  concentrations  of  the  neuro­ transmitter  and  making  them  more  readily  available  for reverse  transport  (Capela  et  al. 2009; Green  et  al. 2003; Yamamoto et al. 2010). Amphetamines  are  widely  acknowledged  as  synthetic drugs.  However,  humans  have  used  natural  amphetamines for  several  millenniums,  through  the  consumption  of amphetamines-producing  plants,  namely Catha  edulis (Khat)  and  various  plants  in  the  genus  Ephedra  (family Ephedraceae),  including Ephedra  sinica  (ma  huang).  Khat is  an  evergreen  plant  that  grows  at  high  altitudes  in  East Africa and  Arabian Peninsula.  Chewing its  fresh leaves  is a widespread  habit  in  the  local  populations,  with  several million  people  consuming  khat  regularly  in  social  sessions that  often  last  for  hours.  Users  of  khat  report  increased levels  of  energy,  alertness,  and  self-esteem,  a  sensation  of elation,  enhanced  imaginative  ability,  and  a hi gher capacity to associate ideas (Carvalho 2003). These effects have been attributed  to  the  khat’s  content  in  cathinone,  a  potent  nat­ ural  amphetamine,  although  other  less-potent  ampheta­ mines  may  also  be  present,  namely  norpseudoephedrine (cathine)  and  norephedrine  (Fig. 1). One  of  the  oldest medicinal  herbs  known  to  mankind  is  probably  Ephedra,  or ma  huang  as  it  is  known  in  Traditional  Chinese  Medicine. The  aerial  parts  of  different  Ephedra  species  contain  at 

least  6  optically  active  amphetamines  (Fig. 1) concentrated in the  internodes. The  amphetamines ephedrine  and pseu­ doephedrine  are  the  main  psychoactive  constituents  of  the plant,  the  others  being  their  optical  isomers  and  N-methylated  derivatives  (Abourashed  et  al. 2003). Ephedroxane 

(Fig. 1), a less-known  amphetamine, has also been isolat ed from  the  aerial  parts  of Ephedra  intermedia  and  has  been detected  in  at  least  6  more  species  containing  ephedrine alkaloids (Konno et al. 1979).

The amphetaminic structure allows the substitutions at the aromatic ring and at the a and /i carbons of the aliphatic chain and  the  amine  terminal,  to  originate  a  wide  range  of amphetamines.  Amphetamines  without  ring  substitutions tend to be psychomotor stimulants, possessing sympathom­ imetic, antifatigue,  and strong  reinforcing effects  in humans. Amphetamines  with  side-chain  substitutions  tend  to  be mainly  psychomotor  stimulants  or  anorectics;  derivatives with  terminal  amine  substitutions  have  psychomotor  stimu­ lant effects at low doses  and hallucinogenic activity at higher doses  (Young  and  Glennon 1986). As  reviewed  by Kleven  and  Seiden 1992, amphetamines  with  aromatic ring  substitutions  are  usually  weak  stimulants,  but  some possess  hallucinogenic  activity  (Kleven  and  Seiden 1992). Compounds  such  as  2,5-dimethoxyphenylisopropylamine  (DMA),  2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenylisopropylamine 

(DOM),  and  3,4,5-trimethoxyamphetamine  all  tend  to exhibit  a  profile  of  sensory,  behavioral,  and  physiological effects  that  are  similar  to  lysergic  acid  (LSD).  Ampheta­ mines  with  methylenedioxy  substitutions  on  the  phenyl  ring 

such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or

3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine  (MDA)  have  both  hallu­ cinogenic  and  stimulant  actions  at  relatively  low  doses  and may  represent  a  novel  class  of  hallucinogens.  The  most representative examples of abused amphetamines are shown in Fig. 2.

More  recently  a  wave  of  new  amphetamines  emerged mainly  constituted  of  cathinone  derivatives.  There  is  the misconception that  these compounds  are “safe”  as some  of them  are  sold  legally  and  are  not  controlled  in  many countries. For  that reason,  these drugs  are so-called  “legalhighs”  .  However,  there  are  numerous  case  reports  of  tox­ icity  similar  to  that  seen  with  classical  amphetamines 

(Karila and  Reynaud 2011). Figure 3 depicts some  of these new amphetamines.

The  aim  of  the  present  review  is  to  give  an  insight  into the  pharmacokinetics,  general  mechanisms  of  biological and  toxicological  actions,  and  the  main  target  organs  for toxicity  of  amphetamines.  For  this  discussion,  we  selected two  classical  amphetamines:  amphetamine  and  metham­ phetamine  and  the  most  popular  amphetamine  designer drug,  MDMA.  Hyponatremia,  a  characteristic  toxic  effect of  MDMA,  will  not  be  included  in  this  review  as  this 

subject has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Pharmacokinetically,  amphetamines  are  a  very  homoge­ neous  group  of  drugs  with  high  oral  bioavailability,  high volume  of  distribution  (around  4  L/kg),  and  low  plasma protein  binding  (usually  less  than  20%).  Elimination  halflife  ranges  between  6  and  12  h,  and  both  renal  and hepatic  elimination  occur.  Though  many  amphetamines are  extensively  metabolized  in  the  liver,  for  several  of these  drugs,  a  significant  percentage  is  generally  excreted without  prior  biotransformation  (Kraemer  and  Maurer 2002).

Chemically,  amphetamines  are  weak  basic  drugs  (with pKa  values  around  9.9)  and  have  relatively  low  molecular weight.  Therefore,  these  drugs  can  easily  cross  cellular membranes  and  lipidic  layers,  attaining  high  levels  in  tis­

sues  and  biological  fluids  with  pH  lower  than  blood, including saliva and sweat (de la Torre et al. 2004a).

Main  pharmacokinetic  features  of  amphetamine,  meth­

amphetamine, and MDMA are summarized below.

Amphetamine  (AMPH)  is  usually  consumed  orally  either 

as  the  S-(+)-enantiomer  (d-amphetamine)  or  as  the  race­

mic  mixture.  Peak  plasma  concentrations  (Cmax)  are  gen­

erally  attained  within  4  h  after  ingestion,  and  both  Cmax 

and  area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  over 

24  h  after  administration  (AUC24)  increase  in  a  dose­

dependent  manner,  with  no  significant  differences  between 

the two enantiomers  (Angrist et al. 1987; Perez-Reyes et al. 

Methamphetamine  (METH)  can  be  used  by  oral  inges­

tion,  intravenous  injection,  snorting,  vapor  inhalation,  or 

smoking  of  the  S-(+)-metamphetamine  hydrochloride  salt. 

The  terminal  plasma  half-life  is  approximately  10  h  for  all 

administration  routes  and  acute  effects  may  persist  up  to 

8  h  after  a  single  moderate  dose  (Cruickshank  and  Dyer 

2009). As  with  intravenous  injection  (i.v.),  smoked  METH 

has  a  rapid  onset  of  action.  Maximum  concentration  (Cmax) 

is  usually a ttained  between 1  and  2.5 h versus  at  least  3  h 

after  oral  administration  (p.o.)  (Harris  et  al. 2003; 

Mendelson  et  al. 1995; Perez-Reyes  et  al. 1991a,  b; 

Schepers  et  al. 2003). Also,  bioavailability  is  significantly 

higher for  smoked M ETH compared  to oral  ingestion (up  to 

90 vs. 67%, respectively) (Cook et al. 1993). Bioavailability

of  snorted  METH  is  about  79%  with  peak  plasma  concen­ trations  attained  after  4  h  (Harris  et  al. 2003; Hart  et  al. 2008) (Table 2). MDMA is  usually ingested  in single  doses of 1 00-200 mg (1.4-2.8  mg/kg).  However,  many  users  repeatedly  take  the drug.  Initial  effects  are  noted  after  approximately  30  min (from  20  to  60  min),  with  maximal  peak  effects  at 60-90  min  after  ingestion  (Green  et  al. 2003). Drug  effects parallel  with  plasma  concentrations  and  last  for  approxi­ mately  6  h  (Hegadoren  et  al. 1999). The  pharmacological effects occur at  1-2 h after  ingestion followed by  a decrease to basal levels over a 4-6 h period (Mas et al. 1999). Pharmacokinetic  (PK)  data  reported  for  MDMA  after  a single per  os  (p.o.)  administration  in  humans  (de  la  Torre et al. 2000a; Fallon et  al. 1999; Fowler et  al. 2008; Helmlin et al. 1996; Mas et al. 1999; Mueller et al. 2009; Navarro et al. 2001; Pizarro et  al. 2004; Samyn et al . 2002; Verebey et al . 1988) are summarized  in Table 3. Several of  these studies show  that  plasma  Cmax  and  AUC24  increase  in  a  dose­ dependent manner for the 50, 75,100 and 125 mg doses (de la  Torre  et  al. 2000a; Mas  et  al. 1999). However,  for  the higher 150  mg dose,  plasma levels  were not  proportional to the dose, suggesting non-linear PK at higher dose ranges (de la Torre et  al. 2000a). These observations can  be explained by the possible saturation of metabolic pathways and binding sites  and  by  the  inhibitory  interaction  of  metabolites  with some  MDMA  metabolizing  enzymes  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004a). The non-linear  PK of  MDMA has  been confirmed  in more  recent  and  larger  cohort  studies  (Fowler  et  al. 2008; Mueller  et  al. 2009). The  urinary recovery  of MDMA seems to be higher at lower doses which also agrees with non-linear PK (de la Torre et al. 2004b). In  spite  of  the  observed  high  interindividual  variability in  the  PK  data  described  for  MDMA,  generally,  after  oral ingestion, peak  plasma concentration  is attained  1.5-3 h,  as with  most  amphetamines  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004a). The volume  of  distribution  has  been  calculated  as  452  ±  137  L (after  the  administration  of  a  125  mg  dose)  (de  la  Torre et  al. 2004a), and  the  reported  elimination  half-life  values, although  varying  substantially  among  studies,  range between 8 and 9 h (de la Torre et al. 2004b). After  the  oral  administration  of  a  racemic  mixture,  it was  observed  that  the  peak  plasma  R-(—)-MDMA  enan­ tiomer  concentration  was  significantly  higher,  and  the pharmacologically  more  active  S-(+)-MDMA  was  more rapidly  eliminated  (Fallon  et  al. 1999; Pizarro  et  al. 2004). These  differences  observed  with  MDMA  enantiomers  in humans  have  been  previously  described  after  the  admin­ istration of MDMA to rats (Fitzgerald et al. 1990). The  apparent  lack  of  proportionality  in  the  plasma  con­ centrations expected  after the  administration of  high MDMA doses,  together  with  the  general  recognition  that  a  large number  of  individuals  ingest  MDMA  repeatedly,  raises 

Springer

serious concern with the  possible potentiation of toxicity  due to unexpectedly high plasma concentrations (de la Torre et al. 2004b). The results obtained at a controlled clinical study with the administration  of two  100 mg  MDMA doses  in two  sep­ arate administrations within 24 h to 9 individuals showed that after  the  ingestion  of  the se cond  dose,  the a ttained  plasma concentrations  could  not  be  explained  simply  through  drug accumulation,  thus  strongly  indicating  metabolic  inhibition lasting over 24 h (Farre et al. 2004). The same authors sub­

sequently  studied  the  influence  of  CYP2D6  genetic  poly­ morphism  on  these  PK  parameters  by  genotyping  the individuals  that  participated  in  the  clinical  study  and  calcu­ lating  the  respective  PK  data  according  to  each  of  the CYP2D6-identified  genotypes.  The  PK  profile  of  MDMA varied according to the different genotypes (de la Torre et al. 2005). The  data  obtained  in  both  studies  are  presented  in Table 4.

Distribution

Amphetamines  in  general  have  low  protein  binding  (usu­ ally  under  20%),  which  confers  high  bioavailability  to these drugs  and favors  their easy  diffusion from  the plasma to the  extravascular compartment (de  la Torre et  al. 2004a). Amphetamine-dependent  individuals  seem  to  have  larger volume  of  distribution  and  plasma  elimination  half-life relative  to  drug-naive  individuals  (6  vs.  4  L/kg),  which  is probably  due  to  tissue  sequestration  as  a  result  of  the development of  PK tolerance  to the  drug (Busto et al. 1989; de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004a). Protein  binding  and  distribution volumes  of  S-(+)-  and  R-(—)-AMPH  enantiomers  are 

similar (Cook et al. 1993) (Table 1).

The  distribution  of  METH  is  similar  to  that  of  AMPH  and is apparently not  significantly influenced by  the route or  time of  administration  (Mendelson  et  al. 1995; Shappell  et  al. 

1996) (Table 2). Methamphetamine  has  been  shown  to accumulate  in sa liva, h air, a nd n ails of dru g abuse rs (Cook et  al. 1993; Suzuki  et  al. 1989). In  spite  of  the  little  contri­ bution  that  this  represents  to  the  overall  disposition  of  the drug,  the  monitoring  of  the  drug  in  these  non-conventional biological matrices is of clinical and forensic interest.

In  a  recent  study,  positron  emission  tomography  (PET) was  used  to  measure  the  whole-body  distribution  of  METH in  19  individuals  (9  Caucasians  and  10  African  Americans) 

(Volkow  et  al. 2010). These  data  showed  that  METH  was highly accumulated in several organs, especially in the lungs, liver,  and  to  a  smaller  extent  in  the  brain  and  the  kidneys. Interestingly,  the  lung  accumulation  of  METH  was  30% higher  for  the  African  American  individuals,  but  did  not differ  in  the  other  studied  organs  (Volkow  et  al. 2010). An earlier study conducted by the same team had already shown a fast (peak uptake at 9 min), widespread (with accumulation in cortical and subcortical brain regions and in white matter),

and  long-lasting  distribution  of  METH  in  human  brain, which  parallels  the  long-lasting  behavioral  effects  of  the drug (Kolbrich et al. 2008). The study revealed no difference in  METH  pharmacokinetics  and  bioavailability  between Caucasians and African Americans.

There  are  several  reports  on  MDMA  concentrations  in 

several  tissues  and  organs,  determined  in  post-mortem 

studies. However, the ingested doses and the corresponding plasma  concentrations  attained  in  fatal  intoxications  are much  higher  than  those  reported  in  the  clinical  studies described before  and that  better agree  with the  recreational use of the drug.  In Table 5, data from several representative 

studies are summarized.  From the presented  data, it can  be concluded  that  MDMA  accumulates  in  several  tissues  and organs,  attaining  much  higher  concentrations  compared  to those found in plasma, which can be up to 18 times higher in the  liver  (De  Letter  et  al. 2004,  2006) and  30  times  higher in the brain (Garcia-Repetto et al. 2003). The data presented in  Tables 5 and 6 highlight  the  notorious  interindividual variability in blood and organ MDMA concentrations.

Metabolism

Amphetamine  is  metabolized  mainly  through  (1)  N-deamination  and  oxidation  into  the  corresponding  benzoic  acid derivatives  that  are  further  conjugated  with  glycine  and excreted  as  the  corresponding  hippuric  acids  and  (2) hydroxylation  in  position  4  of  the  aromatic  ring,  generating 4-hydroxyamphetamine,  followed  by  conjugation  of  the phenol  group  with  sulfate  or  glucuronic  acid  (Kraemer  and Maurer 2002). During  the  hydroxylation  step,  AMPH  can also form  a reactive  intermediate that  can further  react with glutathione  to  form  the  (glutathione-S-yl)-p-hydroxyamphetamine  adduct  (Carvalho  et  al. 1996). The  minor  meta­ bolic  pathway  comprising  the  oxidation  at  the  /(-carbon  of the side  chain leads  to the  formation of  norephedrine that  is oxidized  in  the  aromatic  ring  into  hydroxynorephedrine 

(Caldwell 1980; Kraemer  and  Maurer 2002). Amphetamine N-deamination  seems  to  be  catalyzed  by  CYP450  isoen­ zymes  of  the  CYP2C  subfamily  (Yamada  et  al. 1997), whereas  CYP2D6  is  involved  in  the  hydroxylation  of  the aromatic ring (Bach et al. 2000) (Fig. 4).

The  main  metabolic  reaction  of  METH  is  the  N-demethylation  into  AMPH,  which  is  mainly  catalyzed  by  CYP2D6 

(Bach  et  al. 1999; Lin  et  al. 1997). This  isoenzyme  also catalyses  the  4-hydroxylation  of  the  aromatic  ring  of  METH producing  primarily  4-hydroxymethamphetamine  (Bach et al. 1999; Lin et al. 1997). The involvement of polymorphic CYP2D6  in  the  biotransformation  of  METH  may  partially contribute  to  interindividual  variability  in  metabolism  (Lin et  al. 1997). /(-oxidation  following  N-demethylation  pro­ duces  norephedrine  (Caldwell  et  al. 1972; Kraemer  and Maurer 2002; Lin et al. 1997) (Fig. 4).

la Torre et  al. 2004a). In spite of  retaining biological activity, the  metabolites  do  not  seem  to  contribute  to  the  clinical 

effects of  METH, since  they are  formed at  low levels  and at times  at  which  acute  effects  are  minimal  (Cruickshank  and Dyer 2009).

MDMA  metabolism  in  humans  is  well  documented  and has been the subject of numerous reviews (de la Torre et al. 

2004a,  b; Kraemer  and  Maurer 2002). The  first  studies  on MDMA  metabolism  were  conducted  by  Lim  and  Foltz  in 

methyl,  glucuronide,  and  sulfate  conjugation  (Lim  and Foltz 1988). The  same  authors  would  later  identify  the

et  al. 1988). Subsequent  deamination  and  side-chain  oxi­

dation  leads  to  the  formation  of  phenylketones  followed  by 

oxidation  to  benzoic  acid  derivatives  (Maurer 1996) that 

are  conjugated  with  glycine  and  excreted  as  hippuric  acids 

The  opening  of  the  methylenedioxy  ring  of  both  MDMA 

and  MDA  originates  two  catechol  metabolites,  N-methyl-

a-methyldopamine  (N-Me-a-MeDA)  and  a-methyldop-

amine  (a-MeDA),  respectively.  This  is  the  major  metabolic 

pathway  for  MDMA  in  rat  and  in  humans  (Maurer  et  al. 

2000). Both  catechols  are  subsequently  methylated  by 

catechol-o-methyltransferase  (COMT),  preferentially  at  the 

hydroxyl  group  in  position  4  of  the  aromatic  ring.  These 

monomethylated  metabolites  are  mostly  present  in  plasma 

and  urine  as  conjugates  with  glucuronic  acid  and  sulfate 

(de  la  Torre  et  al. 2000a,  b; Kraemer  and  Maurer 2002; 

Maurer 1996). The  catechol  moiety  confers  high  reactivity 

to  these  metabolites  that  easily  oxidize  into  o-quinones 

(Cho  et  al. 1999). Quinones  oxidation  can  also  originate 

aminochromes  (Bindoli  et  al. 1992) that  further  oxidize 

into melanin-like polymers (Zhang and Dryhurst 1994).

The  redox  cycles  associated  with  these  metabolic  steps 

(Colado  et  al. 1997) originate  reactive  oxygen  (ROS)  and 

nitrogen (RNS) species that, such as the quinones, can attack 

important  intracellular  nucleophiles,  including  cysteine, 

glutathione  (GSH),  and  protein  sulfhydryl  groups,  and 

will eventually impair important macromolecules such as

proteins,  lipids,  and  DNA  (Bindoli  et  al. 1992; Bolton  et  al. 2000). These  quinone  metabolites  can conj ugate wi th GSH originating an adduct that  can further conjugate with  another GSH molecule, acco mpanied by the  generation of ROS  and RNS  (Hiramatsu  et  al. 1990; Monks  et  al. 2004). The  for­ mation of t hese catechol conjuga tes with GSH  was demon­ strated in vitro in human liver microsomes, and  it was shown in the same  study that one  of these a dducts, the 5-( glutathione-S-yl)-a-MeDA,  has  central  nervous  system  (CNS) activity  after  intracerebral  administration  in  the  rat  (Easton et  al. 2003). Also,  the  intracerebral  administration  of  these adducts  produced  a  significant  depletion  of  serotonin  in different rat brain areas, therefore showing that these adducts may  be  implicated  in  MDMA  neurotoxic  effects  (Bai  et  al. 1999; Miller  et  al. 1997). More  recently,  the  in  vivo  forma­ tion of  these adducts  was demonstrated  in the  brain of  rats after subcutaneous injection of MDMA (Jones et al. 2005). In the  same  study,  the  serotonergic  neurotoxicity  of  these metabolites was also observed (Jones et al. 2005). Several  in  vitro  studies  have  contributed  for  the  dem­ onstration  of  the  toxicity  of  several  MDMA  metabolites  by showing  that  the  metabolic  bioactivation  of  the  drug  has an  important  role  in  its  neuronal  (Capela  et  al. 2006a; Gollamudi  et  al. 1989; Patel et  al. 1991), hepatic (Carvalho et  al. 2004a, b), renal  (Carvalho  et  al. 2002b), and  cardiac (Carvalho et al. 2004c) toxicities. In  vivo  studies  in  the  rat  revealed  a  third  metabolic pathway  consisting  in  the  aromatic  hydroxylation  into  trihydroxyamphetamine  and  trihydroxymethamphetamine  that are highly neurotoxic (Lim and Foltz 1991; Zhao et al. 1992). The  cytochrome  P450  isoenzymes  are  involved  in  the metabolic degradation of  MDMA through the  catalysis of the demethylenation  of  the  methylenedioxy  ring  with  formation of  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA  and  the  N-demethylation into  MDA.  The  in  vitro  demethylenation  of  MDMA  follows a  biphasic  Michaelis-Menten  kinetics  with  a  high-affinity and a  low-affinity components  (Kreth et  al. 2000). The highaffinity  component  is  catalyzed  by  CYP2D6,  while  the  lowaffinity component  is mainly  catalyzed by  CYP1A2 and  to a lower  extent  by  CYP2B6  and  CYP3A4  (Kreth  et  al. 2000; Maurer  et  al. 2000; Tucker  et  al. 1994). CYP2D6  contribu­ tion  for  MDMA  demethylenation  was  calculated  to  be around 50%  in vitro  in human  liver and  CYP2D6-expressing microsomes (Ramamoorthy  et al. 2002; Tucker et  al. 1994) and  around  30%  in  vivo  in  humans  (Segura  et  al. 2005). CYP2D6  demethylenation  is  faster  for  the  S-(+)-MDMA enantiomer  compared  to  the  R-(—)-MDMA  enantiomer  (Lin et  al. 1997). The  demethylenation  reaction  can  also  occur without  enzymatic  catalysis  through  a  spontaneous  oxida­ tion involving  the hydroxyl  radical (Kumagai  et al. 1991; Lin et  al. 1992; Maurer  et  al. 2000). In  the  rat,  the  demethyle­ nation  reaction  is  catalyzed  by  the  CYP2D1  and  CYP3A2 isoenzymes (Maurer et al. 2000).

N-demethylation  rate  is  around  one  order  of  magnitude lower  than  the  demethylenation  rate  and  follows  a  monophasic  kinetics,  mainly  catalyzed  by  CYP2B6  and  also  by CYP2D6,  CYP1A2,  and  CYP3A4  in  humans  and  by  iso­ enzymes  CYP1A2  and  CYP2D1  in  rats  (Kreth  et  al. 2000; Maurer et al. 2000).

Table 7 summarizes  the  PK  parameters  of  MDMA metabolites  determined  after  MDMA  administration  in humans.

Excretion

The  plasma  half-life  of  amphetamines  is,  to  a  great  extent, dependent  on  urine  pH,  since  renal  excretion  is  the  main elimination  pathway.  In  humans,  AMPH  and  METH  appear to follow one-compartment pharmacokinetics (Quinn et al.

1997) . Given  that  these  drugs  are  chemically  weak  bases, renal  excretion  increases  with  urine  acidification  and decreases  with  urine  alkalization  (Cook  et  al. 1993; Kim et al. 2004; Quinn et al. 1997). For this reason, there is  wide variability  in  elimination  half-life  and  often  amphetamines abusers ingest bicarbonate  to prolong the  effect of the  drug. Elimination half-life  seems to  be independent  of the  route of administration  and  tends  to  be  longer  in  dependent  AMPH and METH abusers (de la Torre et al. 2004a; Kidwell et al.

1998) .

The  fraction  of  the  AMPH-administrated  dose  excreted without  biotransformation  in  urine  can  vary  between  3  and 55.5%,  within  a  range  of  urinary  pH  from  5  to  8  (Cook et  al. 1993). Due  to  its  faster  metabolism,  the  elimination half-life  of  the  S-(+)-AMPH  enantiomer  is  shorter  than that  of  the  R-(—)-AMPH  enantiomer  (Angrist  et  al. 1987) 

(Table 1).

Approximately  70%  of  a  METH  dose  is  excreted  in urine  within  24  h  after  administration.  METH  is  mainly excreted  unchanged  (up  to  50%  of  the  dose)  and  as  the 4-hydroxymetamphetamine  (15%)  and  AMPH  (10%) metabolites  (Cook  et  al. 1993; Kim  et  al. 2004). Meth­ amphetamine  has  an  elimination  half-life  of  25  h  and accumulates  in  urine  with  repeated  dosing  (Kim  et  al. 2004; Oyler  et  al. 2002). The  fraction  of  unchanged  METH excreted in urine decreases with increasing doses either due to  a  lower  renal  elimination  rate  or  due  to  an  increase  in non-renal  elimination  rates  at  higher  doses  (Cook  et  al. 

1993) (Table 2).

Amphetamines with the methylenedioxy substitution in the aromatic  ring,  like  MDMA,  are  more  extensively  metabo­ lized, and  the amount  excreted in  urine without  biotransfor­ mation is accordingly lower (de la Torre et al. 2004a).

Elimination  half-life  for  MDMA  ranges  between  6  and 9  h  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004a; Mas  et  al. 1999; Ramcharan et al. 1998), and most of  the dose is  excreted within the  first 24 h after ingestion (Fallon et al. 1999).

Around  80%  of  MDMA  is  eliminated  after  hepatic metabolism,  while  approximately  20%  of  the  dose  is excreted  unchanged  in  urine  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004a). MDMA  urinary  elimination  seems  to  be  constant  for  dif­ ferent  doses  (around  60%  urinary  recovery,  independently of  the  administered  dose)  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004a), while non-renal  elimination  is  dose-dependent  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2000a). After  the  oral  administration  of  a  75  mg  dose,  a 74.0  ±71.1  L/h  non-renal  elimination  rate  was  observed. However,  after  a  125  mg  dose,  this  rate  was  38.1  ±  13.3 L/h  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2000a) (see  Table 3). As  previously mentioned,  this  strongly  suggests  hepatic  metabolism impairment  at  elevated  MDMA  doses.  At  high  concentra­ tions,  MDMA  competitively  inhibits  CYP2D6  in  human liver  microsomes  (Wu  et  al. 1997). This  inhibition  occurs through  the  formation  of  a  complex  with  the  enzyme (Heydari  et  al. 2004). The  formation  of  such  complexes involves  the  carbene  formation  after  the  oxidation  of  sub­ strates  containing  tertiary  amines  or  a  methylenedioxy group,  both  of  which  are  present  in  MDMA  molecular structure  (Delaforge  et  al. 1999). This  inhibition  can  occur within  a  period  of  1  h  after  MDMA  ingestion  (at  the  doses commonly  used  for  recreational  purposes),  and  basal enzyme  activity  levels  may  only  be  restored  after  a  period of at least 10 days (Yang et al. 2006). O-methylated  N-Me-a-MeDA,  4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine  (HMMA),  is  the  main  MDMA metabolite  excreted  in  urine  (over  20%  of  the  dose)  fol­ lowed  by  the  catechol  metabolite  N-Me-a-MeDA  (Segura et  al. 2001). These  metabolites  are  mainly  excreted  as  the glucuronide  and  sulfate  conjugates  (Helmlin  et  al. 1996). MDA  urinary  excretion  represents  less  than  10%  of  the MDMA-ingested  dose  (Mas  et  al. 1999; Mueller  et  al. 2009). MDMA can  also be  excreted  in feces,  sweat, saliva, vitreous  humor,  hair,  and  nails.  These  biological  samples may  serve  as  alternatives  to  urine  and  blood  for  the detection  of  MDMA  at  relatively  high  concentrations  (de  la Torre  et  al. 2004a; Samyn  et  al. 2002). MDMA  elimination is  stereoselective,  and  the  pharmacologically  more  active S-(±)-MDMA  enantiomer  is  more  rapidly  metabolized  and excreted  than  the  R-(—)-MDMA  enantiomer  (Fallon  et  al. 1999; Meyer  et  al. 2002a; Moore  et  al. 1996; Ramcharan et al. 1998).

**General mechanisms of amphetamines toxicity**

Hyperthermia

Hyperthermia  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  most  lifethreatening  acute  physiological  consequences  of  the amphetamines  intoxications.  Case  reports  appear  to  indi­ cate  that  the  incidence  and  severity  of  hyperthermia  vary among  drugs,  being  the  amphetamine  derivatives  most often  implicated  METH,  MDMA,  3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine  (MDEA,  “eve”),  and  p-methoxyamphetamine  (PMA)  (Green  et  al. 2004; Jaehne  et  al. 2007). The  most  reported  and  best  studied  amphetamine,  con­ cerning  its  hyperthermic  effects,  is  MDMA,  for  which  body temperatures as high as 43 °C, have been reported in human users  (Green  et  al. 2003; Henry  et  al. 1992). Noteworthy, hyperthermia  mediated  by  these  drugs  seems  to  be responsible  for  frequent  fatal  complications  that  are  also characteristic  of  heatstroke,  such  as  rhabdomyolysis,  acute renal  failure,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC), multiple  organ  failure,  and  acidosis  (Henry  et  al. 1992; Kalant 2001; Kendrick  et  al. 1977). To  worsen  this  sce­ nario,  it  is  unlikely  that  any  single  pharmaceutical  agent will  be  completely  effective  in  reversing  the  hyperthermia 

(dantrolene  may  have  some  effectiveness—see  below),  so careful  body  cooling  using  cold  baths  or  ice  packs  remains the principal clinical approach.

Body  temperature  regulation  is  complex  and  requires  a balance  between  heat  production  and  dissipation.  In  terms of  heat  production,  all  stimulant  drugs  increase  CNS  met­ abolic  activity  and  therefore  potentially  induce  hyperther­ mia  (Parrott 2012; Rusyniak a nd S prague 2005). The  other 

side of  thermal homeostasis  is heat  dissipation. In  animals, this  involves  increasing  the  blood  supply  to  the  tail  in  rats, ears  in  rabbits,  and  piloerection  in  all  hairy  mammals  to facilitate heat  loss. In  humans, the  main physiological  route is  peripheral  vasodilatation,  with  more  warm  blood  to  the 

skin,  increased  skin  temperature,  and  heightened  sweating to facilitate heat loss (Parrott 2012).

As  already  noted,  the  most  studied  amphetamine  con­ cerning  the  mechanisms  leading  to  hyperthermia  is MDMA.  For  that  reason,  only  MDMA-related  studies  will be analyzed  in the  present section.  The effect  of MDMA  on body temperature  is complex  because the  drug has  actions on  all  major  monoamine  neurotransmitters  [5-HT,  DA,  and noradrenaline  (NA)]  both  by  releasing  the  amines  from nerve endings  and also  by acting on  their receptors.  These neurotransmitters  interact  in  complex  ways  to  control temperature  with  actions  involving  both  central  thermo­ regulation  and  peripheral  changes  in  blood  flow  and  brown adipose  tissue  thermogenesis  (Docherty  and  Green 2010). There  is  now  considerable  evidence  suggesting  that  5-HT plays little or no direct role in the acute hyperthermic

response,  due  to  the  relative  inefficacy  of  selective  and 

non-selective  5-HT  receptor  antagonists  and  5-HT 

uptake  inhibitors  to  modulate  MDMA-induced  hyper­

thermia  (Docherty  and  Green 2010). Nevertheless,  the 

initial  release  of  5-HT  also  upregulates  DA  biosynthesis 

and  release  by  activation  of  5-HT2A  post-synaptic 

receptors,  which,  through  subsequent  activation  of  DI 

receptors,  leads  to  the  hyperthermic  response  (Mills 

et al. 2004).

Several  studies  have  revealed  a  complex  interaction 

between  the  hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid  (HPT)  axis, 

sympathetic nervo us system,  and the  activity of  uncoupling 

proteins  (UCP).  Hypophysectomized  and  thyroparathyr-

oidectomized  rats  treated  with  the  same  dose  of  MDMA 

did  not  become  hyperthermic  and  in  fact  displayed  a  sig­

nificant  hypothermia.  When  thyroid  hormone  was  replaced 

to  thyroparathyroidectomized  rats,  they  experienced  the 

hyperthermic  response,  arguing  for  a  role  of  the  HPT  on 

the  hyperthermic  effects  of  MDMA  (Sprague  et  al. 2003). 

Thermoregulation  within  the  hypothalamus  has  been  sug­

gested  to  be  controlled  by  5-HT,  DA,  and  NA,  and,  as 

reviewed  by  Rusyniak  and  Sprague (2005), MDMA  acti­

vates  the  HPT  axis,  with  subsequent  thermogenesis  and 

toxicity  being  dependent  on  the  circulating  levels  of  thy­

roid  and  adrenal hor mones. W hen activated  neurons in  the 

anterior  hypothalamus  stimulate  the  sympathetic  nervous 

system,  NA  is  released  from  nerve  endings  into  the  cir­

culatory  system.  Acting  through  vascular  al-adrenorecep­

tors,  NA  induces  vasoconstriction  and  impairs  heat 

dissipation.  In  concert  with  the  thyroid  hormones,  norepi­

nephrine  also  binds  to  and  activates  al-  and  /?3-adrenore-

ceptors, regulating  the activity  of thermogenic  tissues, such 

as  brown  fat  and  muscle,  through  UCP  (Rusyniak  and 

Sprague 2005). Incorporation  of  UCPs  in  mitochondria, 

referred  to  as  mitochondrial  uncoupling,  dissociates  the 

mitochondrial  proton  gradient  from  ATP  synthesis  and 

releases  the  free  energy  as  heat  (Mills  et  al. 2004). Three 

heat  uncoupling  proteins  are  currently  known:  UCP-1  in 

brown  fat  of  rodents,  UCP-2  in  the  liver,  and  UCP-3  in 

human  skeletal  muscles.  The  activation  of  the  skeletal 

muscle  thermogenic  protein,  UCP-3,  was  demonstrated  to 

have  an  important  role  in  MDMA-induced  hyperthermia.  In 

fact,  mice  deficient  in  a  mitochondrial  protein,  known  as 

UCP-3 (UCP3-/-),  have a  diminished thermogenic  response 

to  MDMA  and  therefore  are  protected  against  its  toxic 

effect (Mills et al. 2003).

As  mentioned  above,  peripherally,  the  increased  body 

temperature  seen  with  MDMA  is  also  due  to  vasocon­

striction.  Hyperthermia  activates  sympathetic  vasodilator 

activity  increasing  cutaneous  blood  flow  and  subsequently 

increasing  convective  heat  transfer  from  the  core  to  the 

periphery  (Mills  et  al. 2004). MDMA  induces  cutaneous 

vasoconstriction, and this cutaneous restriction in blood

flow  contributes  to  the  increase  in  core  body  temperature (Pedersen and Blessing 2001). MDMA  was  also  shown  to  produce  aggregate  toxicity  in mice,  an  event  related  to  MDMA-induced  hyperthermia (Capela  et  al. 2009). The  term  aggregate  toxicity  refers  to the  finding  that  the  toxicity  and  lethality  of  MDMA increases in injected  animals housed in groups  compared to those  housed  singly.  MDMA-aggregate  toxicity  is  closely related  to  its  hyperthermic  effects,  especially  in  crowded settings.  Given  that  MDMA  is  usually  consumed  in  the context  of  crowded,  hot  environment  (such  as  what  com­ monly  occurs  at  rave  parties)  and  prolonged  physical exertion,  these  factors  may  also  strongly  contribute  to  the hyperthermic effect  that occurs  in humans  (Freedman et  al. 2005; Patel et al. 2005). In  experimental  laboratory  animals,  there  are  reports confirming  that  ambient  temperatures  can  influence  the effect  of  MDMA  and  other  amphetamines  on  body  tem­ perature,  as  MDMA-treated  animals  exposed  to  low  envi­ ronmental  temperature  (below  22°C)  tend  to  develop hypothermia,  whereas  under  high  environmental  tempera­ ture  (above  28°C)  can  reach  life-threatening  hyperthermia (Capela  et  al. 2009). Overall,  when  evaluating  the t hermo­ regulatory  effects  of  MDMA,  one  must  take  into  account the  environmental  temperature  at  which  the  experiment  is conducted.  Along  with  elevated  ambient  temperature, motor  activity  increases  the  toxicity  of  stimulants  such  as AMPH  and  MDMA.  Because  motor  activity  can  increase body  temperature  and  exhaust  supplies  of  ATP,  it  is  not surprising  that  the  combination  of  increased  motor  activity and  stimulant  use  results  in  exaggerated  toxicity  (Rusyniak and Sprague 2005). There  is  marked  similarity  between  clinical  signs  and symptoms  of  MDMA  intoxication  and  a  malignant  hyper­ thermia crisis, though the heat-generation mechanisms at the muscle  level  are  quite  different.  Malignant  hyperthermia  is an  autosomal-dominant  inherited  disorder  of  the  skeletal muscle cell,  characterized by  a hypermetabolic  response to halogenated  volatile  anesthetics  and  depolarizing  muscle relaxants.  It  involves  disruption  of  intracellular  calcium homeostasis  caused  by  a  defect  in  the  ryanodine  receptor type 1  (Wappler 2001). On the  other hand,  the pathophysi­ ological  mechanism  of  MDMA  intoxication  at  the  skeletal muscle  level  is  most  likely  to  be  the  combination  of  its agonistic  effect  on  the  nAChR  of  the  skeletal  muscle,  the increased sensitivity of the contractile apparatus to Ca2+, and the  cytotoxicity  of  MDMA  metabolites  (Gerbershagen  et  al. 2012). In  spite  of  the  mechanistic  differences,  the  similar disruption  of  Ca2+  homeostasis  explains  why  dantrolene,  a drug  used  in  the  treatment  of  malignant  hyperthermia through  inhibition  of  Ca2+  release,  is  currently  recom­ mended for  MDMA-induced hyperpyrexia  by several  poison control centers.  Though the  effectiveness of  this drug  is still

controversial,  it  may  lower  mortality  rates  and  reduce  the incidence  of  severe  complications,  especially  in  patients with  severe  (>40°C)  or  extreme  (>42°C)  hyperpyrexia 

(Grunau et al. 2010).

Oxidative stress

Formation of ROS and/or RNS

The  formation  of  ROS  and/or  RNS  and  the  resulting  oxi­ dative  and/or  nitrosative  stress  is  a  common  toxicological pathway  of  amphetamines,  which  has  an  important  role  on the  observed  pathogenesis,  both  at  peripheral  organs 

(Carvalho et  al. 2010; Ninkovic et  al. 2008; Shenouda et  al. 2010) and  the  CNS  (Alves  et  al. 2009; Cadet  et  al. 1994; Capela  et  al. 2007b). In  the  present  section,  the  mecha­ nisms  involved  in  the  formation  of  ROS  and  RNS  will  be briefly explained.

Oxidative  deamination  of  monoaminergic neurotransmitters by monoamine oxidase

One  of  the  most  important  pathways  leading  to  sustained production of  ROS mediated  by amphetamines  is related  to their  general  pharmacological  mechanism  of  action:  the massive  release  of  monoamine  neurotransmitters  (mainly 5-HT,  DA,  and  NA)  from  neuronal  storage  vesicles.  While 

still  inside  the  neuronal  cytoplasm,  part  of  these  mono­ amines  will  undergo  oxidative  deamination  by  MAO, present  in  the  external  membranes  of  mitochondria  (Alves et  al. 2009; Cadet  et  al. 1994; Capela  et  al. 2007b). This metabolic  transformation  produces  H2O2,  as  a  by-product. H2O2  then  interacts  with  transition  metal  ions  such  as  iron 

(Krasnova and  Cadet 2009; Quinton and  Yamamoto 2006), to  form  toxic  hydroxyl  radicals  (Nagatsu 2004). Using mouse  brain  synaptosomes  as  experimental  model,  it  was demonstrated  that  H2O2  generation  induced  by  incubation of  synaptosomes  with  DA  and  5-HT  was  MAO-dependent 

(Barbosa  et  al. 2012). 5-HT  has been  shown to  be meta b­ olized  in  vitro  by  MAO-A  (Km  =  178  ±  2  pM)  and MAO-B  (Km  =  1,170  ±  432  pM),  which  means  that metabolism  by  MAO-B  is  only  residual  in  the  presence  of MAO-A  (Shih  et  al. 1999). It  is  important,  nevertheless,  to mention  that  MAO-B  is  fully  effective  in  the  absence  of MAO-A,  as  it  happens  inside  serotonergic  nerves  (Alves et al. 2009; Alves et al. 2007).

Metabolism  of  amphetamines  containing  a  methylenedioxy group and auto-oxidation of catecholamines

Hepatic  metabolism  of  amphetamines  containing  a  meth­ ylenedioxy  group  is  a  significant  source  of  ROS  and  other chemically  reactive  compounds.  MDMA  is  the  best-known

example,  but  this  methylenedioxy  group  is  also  present  in MDA,  methylone,  buthylone,  among  others.  As  discussed before,  the  hepatic  metabolism  of  MDMA  involves N-demethylation  to  MDA.  MDMA  and  MDA  are  O-dem-

ethylenated  to  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA,  respectively 

(Kumagai  et  al. 1991; Lim  and  Foltz 1998; Pizarro  et  al. 

2004). These  metabolites,  formed  in  liver  cells,  can  reach the  heart,  the  kidney,  the  brain,  and  other  organs  via  the 

circulation  and  produce  their  toxic  effects,  mainly  due  to the  auto-oxidation  of  the  catecholic  groups  into  reactive 

o-quinones  (Macedo  et  al. 2007; Spencer  et  al. 1998). 

Another  source  of  this  group  of  reactive  compounds 

are  catecholic  neurotransmitters  and  respective  precursors 

or  metabolites,  especially  DA,  L-Dopa,  and  3,4-dihy-

droxyphenylacetic  acid  (DOPAC),  which  also  undergo 

non-enzymatic,  spontaneous  auto-oxidation  to  the  corre­

sponding  o-quinones  (Fiaschi  and  Cerretani 2010). Apart 

from  auto-oxidation,  o-quinones  are  also  generated  by  the 

enzymatic  oxidation  of  DA  by  prostaglandin  H  synthase 

(cyclooxygenase:  COX),  lipoxygenase,  tyrosinase,  and 

xanthine oxidase  (Kita et  al. 2009). These quinones  may be 

oxidized  to  the  cyclized  aminochromes  and  are  then  finally polymerized  to  form  melanin,  but  may  otherwise  exert toxicity  to  nerve  endings.  As  recently  reviewed  (Kita  et  al. 

2009; Krasnova  and  Cadet 2009; Song  et  al. 2010), qui­

nones  are  highly  redox-active  molecules  that  can  undergo the  following  pathways:  (1)  a  redox  cycle  producing 

semiquinone  radicals,  leading  to  the  generation  of  super­

oxide  radicals  and  H2O2.  Subsequent  formation  of  hydro­ xyl  radicals  (HO)  through  interactions  of  superoxide  and hydrogen  peroxide  with  transition  metals  leads  to  oxidative 

stress,  mitochondrial  dysfunctions,  and  peroxidative  dam­

age  to  pre-synaptic  membranes;  (2)  irreversible  1,4-

intramolecular  cyclization  with  subsequent  formation  of 

aminochromes;  (3)  conjugation  with  GSH  to  form  a 

glutathionyl  adduct  that  can  further  react  with  GSH  and protein  thiols,  leading  to  GSH  depletion  and  formation  of protein  adducts,  leading  to  inactivation  of  the  target  pro­ teins.  In  particular,  it  is  of  interest  that  DA  quinones  gen­

erated  in  the  brain  covalently  modify  and  inactivate tyrosine  hydroxylase  and  the  DA  transporter,  subsequently inhibiting both DA synthesis and uptake.

Generation of ROS in mitochondria

ROS  are  inevitable  products  of  the  normal  respiration  in mitochondria.  Studies  on  isolated  mitochondria  have identified  complex  I  and  complex  III  as  possible  sites  of ROS  generation  in  the  electron  respiratory  chain  (ETC) 

(Votyakova  and  Reynolds 2001). Thus,  compounds  that 

interfere  with  these  mitochondrial  complexes  may  lead  to 

increased  ROS  production.  The  first  investigation  of METH-  and  MDMA-induced  alterations  in  the  function  of 

specific  ETC  complexes  showed  that  both  METH  and 

MDMA  decrease  levels  of  cytochrome  oxidase,  a  marker 

of  ETC  complex  IV  activity  (Burrows  et  al. 2000). 

In subsequent  studies, a  decrease in  complex II—III  but not 

I—III  activity  was  observed  in  the  striatum  at  both  1  and 

24  h  after  METH  (Brown  et  al. 2005). More  recently,  it 

was  demonstrated  that  the  exposure  of  an  adolescence ra t 

model  to  a  neurotoxic  binge  administration  of  MDMA 

(four  times,  10  mg/kg,  i.p.,  every  2  h)  induced  oxidative 

stress  to  whole-brain  mitochondria  (Alves  et  al. 2007). 

Additionally,  analysis  of  mitochondrial  DNA  (mtDNA) 

revealed  that  NDI  (nicotinamide  adenine  dinucleotide 

phosphate  dehydrogenase  subunit  I)  and  NDII  (nicotin­

amide  adenine  dinucleotide  phosphate  dehydrogenase 

subunit  II)  subunits  of  mitochondrial  complex  I  and  cyto­

chrome  c  oxidase  subunit  I  of  complex  IV  suffered  dele­

tions  in  MDMA-exposed  animals.  Inhibition  of  MAO-B  by 

selegiline  did  not  reduce  hyperthermia,  but  reversed 

MDMA-induced  effects  in  the  oxidative  stress  markers, 

mtDNA,  and  related  protein  expression  (Alves  et  al. 2007). 

Since  MAO  is  localized  in  the  outer  membrane  of  the 

mitochondria,  the  formation  of  H2O2  resulting  from  the 

enzyme  metabolism  of  MDMA-released  monoamine  neu­

rotransmitters  (mostly  NA,  5-HT,  and  DA)  will  mostly 

affect  the  mitochondria  itself.  As  explained  below,  another 

effect  mediated  by  amphetamines  is  the  rise  in  intracellular 

Ca 2+   due  to  the  excitotoxic  effect  of  glutamate.  This  effect 

may  also  lead  to  inhibition  of  mitochondrial  function  with 

consequent increased ROS production (Brown et al. 2005).

Oxidative  damage  to  the  mitochondria  due  to  overpro­

duction  of  ROS  can  initiate  the  intracellular  cascade  of 

reactions  leading  to  neurotoxicity.  In  particular,  METH  has 

been  shown  to  induce  increases  in  proapoptotic  proteins, 

BAX and BID, and decreases  in antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 

and  Bcl-XL,  which  results  in  the  activation  of  downstream 

apoptotic cascade, characterized by release of mitochondrial 

proteins  cytochrome  c,  apoptosis-inducing  factor  (AIF),  and 

Smac/DIABLO  into  the  cytosol  followed  by  activation  of 

caspases  9  and  3,  and  the b reakdown o f se veral  structural 

cellular proteins (Cadet and Krasnova 2009).

Excitotoxicity and production of RNS

Excessive glutamate r elease induced by  amphetamines has 

been  linked  with  NO-mediated  nitration  of  proteins  in  DA 

and  5-HT  terminals  and  neuronal  cell  death  (Krasnova  and 

Cadet 2009; Quinton  and  Yamamoto 2006; Yamamoto  and 

Raudensky 2008). This  process,  termed  excitotoxicity,  is 

mediated  by  the  activation  of  ionotropic  and  group  1 

metabotropic  glutamate  receptors  (iGluR  and  mGluR, 

respectively),  leading  to  a  rise  in  intracellular  Ca2+  levels. 

This  rise  in  Ca2+  leads  to  activation  of  a  variety  of  cal­

cium-dependent  enzymes,  namely  NO  synthase,  with

subsequent generation  of NO  and ensuing  RNS, as  well as activation  of  apoptotic  pathways,  culminating  in  failure  of cellular  organelles,  such  as  mitochondria  and  endoplasmic reticulum  (ER),  breakdown  of  cytoskeletal  proteins,  and DNA  damage  (Yamamoto  et  al. 2010). An  increase  in  NO and  ONOO  “-mediated  nitration  of  proteins  is  important  in light  of  the  fact  that  tyrosine  hydroxylase  and  tryptophan hydroxylase,  biosynthetic  enzymes  of  DA  and  5HT, respectively,  are  readily  nitrated  by  both  NO  and  ONOO(Fiaschi  and  Cerretani 2010). Additionally,  ONOO-  is known  to  decrease  mitochondrial  complex  II-III  activity (Yamamoto  and  Raudensky 2008). Among  the  enzymes activated  by  glutamate  in  the  event  of  stimulation  by amphetamines  is  the  protease  calpain  I  leading  to  the proteolysis of sever al cytoskeletal proteins  such as spectrin, tau,  and  microtubule-associated  protein  2  (MAP  2) (Quinton  and  Yamamoto 2006). Another  downstream effect  of  calpain  activation  may  occur  in  relation  to METH-  and  MDMA-induced  increases  in  oxidative  stress. Glutamate-mediated  calpain  activation  also  catalyzes  the conversion of  xanthine dehydrogenase  to xanthine  oxidase, which  catabolizes  xanthine  and  hypoxanthine  to  uric  acid, yielding  superoxide  radicals  in  the  process  (Dykens  et  al. 1987).

Microglial activation

Microglia  are  the  resident  immune  cells  within  CNS  that function  to  protect  the  brain  against  injury  or  damage. Although  microglial  activation  is  necessary  for  host defense  and  neuron  survival,  the  overactivation  of microglia  results  in  deleterious  and  neurotoxic  conse­ quences.  Amphetamines,  like  METH,  MDMA,  AMPH,  and p-chloroamphetamine,  induce  a  substantial  microglial response  in  the  areas  of  the  brain  that  show  neuronal degeneration,  mediating  the  release  of  toxic  substances such  as  superoxide  radicals,  NO,  pro-inflammatory  cyto­ kines,  and  prostaglandins,  which  have  already  been implicated  in  their  neurotoxicity  (Cadet  and  Krasnova 2009; Thomas  et  al. 2004). Another  mechanism  by  which microglial  activation  by  amphetamines  may  contribute  to neurotoxicity is  via increases  in the  expression of  cytokines such as  IL-1/1, IL-6,  and TNF-a,  which initiate  and promote neuroinflammation (Yamamoto and Raudensky 2008).

Depletion of antioxidants

Amphetamines  can  also  cause  oxidative  stress  by decreasing  the  activity  or  expression  of  antioxidant  enzy­ matic  and/or  non-enzymatic  antioxidant  systems,  including Cu-Zn  superoxide  dismutase  (SOD),  catalase,  GSH,  glu­ tathione  peroxidase  (GPX),  glutathione  reductase  (GR), glutathione  S-transferase  (GST)  and  peroxiredoxins  (Cadet 

<£) Springer

and  Krasnova 2009; Carvalho  et  al. 1996,  2002a,  2004b). The  depletion  of  these  crucial  endogenous  antioxidants may  render  the  affected  cells  defenseless  against  the  del­ eterious effects of ROS and RNS.

Hyperthermia

One  of  the  mechanisms  by  which  amphetamines  increase the  formation  of  ROS  and  RNS  is  through  hyperthermia.  In fact,  free  radical  formation  is  inhibited  when  the  acute MDMA-induced  hyperthermia  is  prevented  (Colado  et  al. 

1999). Furthermore,  prevention  of  MDMA-induced  hyper­ thermia  decreases  the  neurotoxicity,  and  many  drugs  that protect  against  MDMA-induced  neurotoxicity  also  decrease body temperature  (Fiaschi and  Cerretani 2010). Though the pathways leading to the higher  production of ROS and RNS under  hyperthermic  conditions  remain  elusive,  mitochon­ dria,  one  of  the  main  sources  of  ROS  in  cells,  undergo  a temperature-dependent  uncoupling  during  increases  in temperature,  associated  with  increased  superoxide  forma­ tion  (Brown  et  al. 2005; Flanagan  et  al. 1998). Hyperther­ mia  also  increases  the  conversion  of  the  enzyme  xanthine dehydrogenase t o the  oxidase form,  an important  source of oxygen-derived free radicals (Skibba et al. 1989).

**Amphetamines Neurotoxicity**

One  of  the  most  feared  and  debated  health  risks  of amphetamines  is  related  to  their  potential  neurotoxic effects.  Indeed,  this  subject  has  been  extensively  resear­ ched  in  the  past  4  decades.  When  typing  in  the  USA governmental  website  “PubMed”  the  combination 

“amphetamine  and  neurotoxicity,”  one  can  find  more  than a thousand  papers on the  subject. Using the  same strategy, the  combination  “methamphetamine  and  neurotoxicity” will  provide  more  than  600  papers,  and  for  “3,  4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine  and  neurotoxicity”  more  than 450 papers are listed. Despite this huge amount of research, there  are  still  many  unsolved  issues  that  warrant  further research.  In  this  chapter,  findings  of  laboratory  studies  in animals  and  available  data  on  the  neurotoxicity  of amphetamines in humans will be discussed.

Amphetamines  promote  the  release  of  monoamines in the brain

Amphetamines act as substrate-type rele asers. They bind to the  plasma  membrane  monoamine  transporters,  being transported  and  translocated  into  the  cytoplasm,  stimulat­ ing  neurotransmitter  release  through  these  transporters 

(Kahlig  et  al. 2005; Ramamoorthy  and  Blakely 1999; Rothman  et  al. 2001; Sulzer  et  al. 1995). Amphetamines

present  different  affinities  toward  the  monoamine  trans­ porters,  DAT,  NET,  and  5-HTT.  Nevertheless,  the  inter­ action  with  these  transporters  is  essential  to  trigger  the release  of  monoamines,  since  in  their  absence,  or  inhibi­ tion,  amphetamines  do  not  elicit  their  biological  effects (Sitte  and  Freissmuth 2010). Amphetamines  induce  NA, DA,  and  5-HT  neurotransmitter  release  by  two  mecha­ nisms:  (1)  neurotransmitters  exit  the  cell  along  their  con­ centration  gradients  via  reversal  of  normal  5-HTT  function and  (2)  cytoplasmic  concentrations  of  transmitters  are increased  due  to  drug-induced  disruption  of  vesicular storage  (Azmitia  et  al. 1990; Berger  et  al. 1992; Crespi et  al. 1997; Gudelsky  and  Nash 1996; Partilla  et  al. 2006; Wichems  et  al. 1995). In  a  first  step,  amphetamines  are recognized  by  DAT,  NET,  and/or  5-HTT  and  enter  the monoaminergic  neuron.  Inside  the  cell,  amphetamine molecules  will  be  preferentially  in  their  protonated  form, because  the  intracellular  pH  is  lower  than  the  extracellular pH.  Unprotonated  amphetamine  molecules  can  diffuse back  into  the  synaptic  cleft  through  the  membrane  and  be quickly  available  for  another  round  of  transporter-mediated uptake (Sitte  and Freissmuth 2010). Once in  the cytoplasm, the  rapid  enhancement  of  monoamine  release  from  the storage  vesicles  by  amphetamines  occurs  via  a  carriermediated  exchange  mechanism.  Amphetamines  are  sub­ strates  for  vesicular  monoamine  transporter  (VMAT)  and possibly  enter  the  vesicles  via  VMAT  and  deplete  vesicular neurotransmitter  storage  by  reversal  of  transporter  activity (Partilla  et  al. 2006). Amphetamines  can  also  deplete vesicular  biogenic  amine  content  by  disrupting  the  pH gradient, via  a weak  base effect  that powers  the transporter (Fleckenstein and  Hanson 2003). Moreover, amphetamines are  known  for  their  MAO  inhibitory  properties,  therefore increasing  the  cytosolic  content  of  monoamines  through inhibition  of  their  metabolism  (Mantle  et  al. 1976). These coordinated  actions  explain  why  amphetamines  are  potent monoamine releasers. Another  important  aspect  of  the  brain  actions  of amphetamines  is  their  ability  to  regulate  the  activity  of  the monoamine  transporters.  Amphetamines  are  known  to regulate  the  phosphorylation  state  of  the  transporter, thereby  regulating  their  function  (Cervinski  et  al. 2005; Ramamoorthy and Blakely 1999). The loss of the transporter function  is  accompanied  by  the  loss  of  surface-expressed transporters.  Overall,  the  modulation  of  transporter  activity and  sequestration  seems  to  be  a  feature  of  all  monoamine transporter substrates. When  relating  these  actions  with  neurotoxicity,  it  is important to notice  that an  increase in  the cytoplasmic  pool of  monoamines  triggers  oxidative  stress  inside  the  nerve terminal  by  two  mechanisms.  First,  the  auto-oxidation properties  of  catecolamines,  DA,  and  NE  can  produce deleterious  ROS.  Second,  the  metabolism  of  monoamines 

by  the  active  MAO  isoforms  can  also  lead  to  ROS  as  by­ products.  Through  these  coordinated  actions,  the  toxicity inside  the  monoaminergic  terminal  is  increased  and  nerve terminal loss can occur (Capela et al. 2009).

Initial  reports  on  the  neurotoxicity  of  amphetamines: observational studies

The  brain  neurotoxic  actions  of  amphetamines  have  been evaluated  mainly  through  biochemical  and  histological  or immunocytochemical  techniques.  The  biochemical  mark­ ers  of  neurotoxicity  include  the  decreased  levels  of monoamines  and  their  major  metabolites,  the  decrease  in the  monoamine  transporter  binding  sites,  as  well  as  the lower  expression  and/or  activity  of  enzymes  involved  in the  synthesis  and  metabolism  of  brain  monoamine  neuro­ transmitters.  The  histological  or  immunocytochemical indicators  of  neurotoxicity  use  staining  methods  to  mark monoaminergic  neurons.  This  can  be  achieved  by  using 

silver  staining  methods  or  specific  antibodies  directed toward  specific  neuronal  markers.  The  fact  that  neuronal markers  are  depleted  after  amphetamines  administration does  not  necessarily  imply  that  neurodegeneration  has indeed  occurred.  Absolute  direct  identification  of  neuro­ toxic  damage  can  only  be  made  with  histological  or immunocytochemical  techniques  that  can  reveal  neurode­ generation. Neurodegeneration can  be partial, with  the loss of  neuronal  terminals,  axons,  or  dendrites,  or  total  with total neuron loss.

Probably,  the  first  published paper  that clearly  described that  AMPH  could  produce  depletion  of  the  monoamine content  was  published  in  1961.  McLean  and  McCartney found  that  rats  treated  with  S-(+)-amphetamine  enantiomer 

(d-AMPH)  sulfate  presented  lowered  brain  NA  levels,  an effect that  the authors  reported to  last for  several days  after treatment  (McLean  and  McCartney 1961). In  1962,  another paper confirmed this  event in rabbits,  which presented lower NA  levels  in  the  hypothalamus,  after  a  single  s.c.  injection of  20  mg/kg  of  d-AMPH  sulfate  (Sanan  and  Vogt 1962). In 

1963, another  paper reported  that mice  had lower  NA brain levels  4  h  after  AMPH  administration.  Moreover,  the depletion  increased  in  a  dose-dependent  manner  (Moore 

1963). Years later, two papers published in Science reported that  AMPH  promoted  selective  damage  to  dopaminergic neurons in  the rat  brain, accompanied  by DA  depletion and decreased  tyrosine  hydroxylase  (TH)  activity,  which  lasted 

several  days  after  AMPH  administration  (Ellison  et  al. 

1978; Fuller and Hemrick-Luecke 1980).

Other  amphetamines  were,  as  well,  reported  to  deplete brain  monoamine  levels.  Chloroamphetamines,  namely p-chloroamphetamine, were  shown to  produce brain  deple­ tions of  5-HT,  both in  rats and  guinea pigs  (Pletscher et  al. 

1964; Sanders-Bush  and  Sulser 1970). Methamphetamine

and fenfluramine administration to rats also caused depletion of  brain  monoamines.  In  rats,  METH  (90  pmol/kg,  i.p.) caused  depletion  of  brain  NA  and  5-HT,  whereas  fenflura­ mine (90  pmol/kg i.p.)  produced a  selective and  long-lasting depletion of brain 5-HT (Morgan et al. 1972). The  neurotoxic  actions  of  amphetamines  are  not  limited to  depletions  of  monoamine  brain  levels.  Actual  degener­ ation  of  neuronal  fibers  has  been  shown  in  the  brain  of laboratory  animals.  Pellets  containing  d-AMPH  implanted subcutaneously  in  rats,  which  released  this  drug  continu­ ously  for  10  days,  promoted  swollen  DA  axons  in  the caudate  nucleus  (Ellison  et  al. 1978). Also  in  the  mouse model,  infusion  of  large  doses  of  d-AMPH  continuously  for 7  days  by  means  of  osmotic  minipumps  caused  a  longlasting  reduction  of  DA  nerve  terminals,  which  was  dem­ onstrated  histochemically  in  the  striatum  of  mice  (Jonsson and  Nwanze 1982). It  was  found  that  METH  induces  ter­ minal  degeneration  along  with  correlative  DA  neuro­ chemical  deficits  in  the  neostriatum  and  nucleus accumbens  of  rats  (Ricaurte  et  al. 1982). Rats  treated  with METH  (15  mg/kg, s.c.)  every 6  h for  24 h,  and killed  6 and 11 days  after treatment,  presented a  significantly increased number  of  swollen  nerve  DA  fibers  in  the  neostriatum (Hanspeter 1981). Also  in  rats,  METH  and  AMPH  con­ tinuously  administered  for  3  days  by  means  of  subcutane­ ously  implanted  osmotic  minipumps  (total  dose  of  each drug  was  approximately  4  mg/day)  presented  selective striatal  DA  depletion  accompanied  by  striatal  nerve  fiber degeneration (Ricaurte et al. 1984). Another  amphetamine,  MDMA,  was  also  reported  to promote  neurotoxic  actions  toward  the  CNS.  Most  likely, the  first  report  proving  that  MDMA  induces  neurotoxicity was conducted  in rats  and wa s published  in 1986  (Schmidt et  al. 1986). In  the  following  year,  there  were  already,  at least,  six  papers  corroborating  MDMA-induced  serotoner­ gic  neurotoxicity  to  rats  (Battaglia  et  al. 1987; Commins et al. 1987; Schmidt 1987; Schmidt et  al. 1987; Stone et  al. 1987a, b). Nonetheless,  in  1985,  one  year  before  the  first report  on  MDMA-induced  neurotoxicity,  another  study published  in  Science  had  reported  that  MDA,  a  major active  metabolite  of  MDMA,  produced  serotonergic neurotoxicity  (Ricaurte  et  al. 1985). MDMA  was  shown  to promote  damage  to  the  terminal  portions  of  axons,  as indicated  by  the  reduced  density  of  fine,  arborized  5-HT axons  and  sparing  of  smooth,  straight  pre-terminal  fibers, while  fibers  of  passage  and  raphe  cell  bodies  were  unaf­ fected  (Molliver  et  al. 1990; O’Heam  et  al. 1988). In  rats, 2  weeks  after  systemic  administration  of  MDA  or  MDMA (20  mg/kg,  s.c.,  twice  daily  for  4  days),  a  selective  and profound  loss  of  5-HT  axons  throughout  the  forebrain,  and fragmented  5-HT  axons  anatomic  evidence  for  degenera­ tion  of  5-HT  projections,  was  observed  (O’Heam  et  al. 1988). Moreover,  the  loss  of  the  5-HT  terminals  in  rats  is 

<£) Springer

both  biochemically  and  histologically  comparable  to  the one  that  occurs  following  exposure  to  a  classic  5-HT neurotoxin,  5,7-dihidroxytryptamine  (Capela  et  al. 2008; Xie et al. 2006).

In  non-human  primates,  the  neurotoxic  actions  of amphetamines  were  also  studied  and  reported.  Long-last­ ing  depletion  of  DA  and  other  DA  nerve  terminal  markers has  been  reported  in  striatum  of  non-human  primates receiving  METH.  Rhesus  monkeys  were  treated  for 

3-6  months  with  i.v.  injections  of  METH  8  times/day 

(final  dose  3.0-6.5  mg/kg/injection)  (Seiden  et  al. 1976). After  this  regimen,  monkeys  exhibited  fairly  uniform depletion  of  NA  in  all  brain  areas  24  h  after  the  last injection,  and  NA  levels  remained  low  in  the  midbrain  and frontal  cortex,  but  returned  to  normal  levels  in  the  pons­ medulla  and  hypothalamus.  Most  importantly,  this  regi­ men  also  caused a 70-80%  reduction of  caudate DA  levels in  monkeys  treated  over  3-6  months  (Seiden  et  al. 1976). Also  in  rhesus  monkeys,  METH  administered  s.c.  over  a 2-week  period  promoted  decreases  in  DA  and  5-HT,  but not  NA  levels,  in  various  brain  regions.  Noteworthy,  the decrease  in  caudate  DA  levels  was  accompanied  by  a decrease in  the number  of DA  uptake sites  and a  decrease in  the  cerebrospinal  fluid  concentration  of  homovanillic acid  (HVA)  (Preston  et  al. 1985). Another  study,  also conducted  in  rhesus  monkeys,  reported  that  approximately 4  years  after  the  last  drug  injection,  the  levels  of  DA  and 5-HT  in  caudate  were  below  control  levels  as  were  con­ centrations  of  5-HT  in  several  other  brain  regions.  The authors  concluded  that,  although  a  possible  partial recovery  can  occur,  these  results  strongly  suggested  that METH-induced  neurotoxicity  may  be  permanent  in  the monkey brain (Woolverton et al. 1989).

MDMA-induced  neurotoxicity  was  demonstrated  in 

squirrel  monkeys  that  presented  reduced  serotonergic innervation  and  reduced  5-HT  levels,  7  years  following exposure  to  the  drug  (Hatzidimitriou  et  al. 1999). This 

study  clearly  showed  that  the  damage  of  MDMA  toward the  serotonergic  system  is  long  lasting  and  apparently irreversible.  In  another  study  conducted  with  squirrel monkeys,  which  were  previously  challenged  with  MDMA 

(total dose  40 mg/kg,  s.c.), the  authors reported  substantial 

serotonergic  axonal  sprouting  and  a  highly  abnormal re-innervation  pattern  18  months  after  MDMA  (Fischer et al. 1995).

Following  these  reports  on  the  neurotoxic  actions  of amphetamines,  many  others  continued  to  prove  that administration  of  single  or  multiple  doses  of  amphetamines to  mice,  rats,  or  non-human  primates  results  in  neurotox­ icity  to  dopaminergic  or  serotonergic  neurons,  but  also  to other  types  of  neurons.  Initial  reports  on  the  neurotoxic effects  of  amphetamines  were  mainly  focused  on  the damage of serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

Nonetheless,  more  recent  studies  demonstrate  a  broader neuronal  cell  death.  MDMA  produced  neuronal  degenera­ tion  in  several  rat  brain  areas  such  as  the  cortex,  hippo­ campus,  the  ventromedial/ventrolateral  thalamus,  and  the tenia  tecta  (Commins  et  al. 1987; Meyer  et  al. 2004; Schmued 2003; Warren  et  al. 2007). Methamphetamine administrated  to  mice  was  shown  to  cause  neuronal  death in  several  brain  areas  including  the st riatum, h ippocampus, cortex,  indusium  griseum,  medial  habenular  nucleus,  and amygdala  (Bowyer  and  Ali 2006; Deng  et  al. 2001; Jayanthi  et  al. 2004; Warren  et  al. 2007; Zhu  et  al. 2006). Therefore,  the  neurotoxicity  of  amphetamines  is  not  only limited  to  the  serotonergic  and  dopaminergic  nerve  termi­ nals but  also promotes  actual neuronal  death in  the cortex, striatum, and  hippocampus of  laboratory animals  (Krasnova et  al. 2005). These  results,  obtained  in  vivo,  were  also demonstrated  in  cultured  neurons.  Methamphetamine, MDMA,  and  other  amphetamines  were  proven  to  induce neuronal  apoptosis  in  cultured  rat  cortical  and  cerebellar granule  neurons  (Capela  et  al. 2006a, b, 2007a; Jimenez et al. 2004; Stumm et al. 1999). In  summary,  from  the  above-mentioned  studies,  it  is possible  to  conclude  that  (1)  amphetamines  promote  neu­ rotoxic  actions  toward  monoaminergic  neurons  in  the  brain of  laboratory  animals;  (2)  the  neurotoxic  actions  are  man­ ifested  by  long-lasting  depletions  of  brain  neurotransmit­ ters  and  their  metabolites,  reduction  of  monoamine transporter  activity,  and  terminal  neuronal  damage;  (3) AMPH  and  METH  are  usually  more  prone  to  promote damage  to  the  dopaminergic  system,  while  MDMA  is regarded  as  serotonergic  neurotoxins;  and  (4)  despite  ter­ minal  degeneration  of  monoaminergic  neurons,  other  types of neurons can also be affected.

Neurotoxicity of amphetamines in experimental animals: neuroprotection studies

In order  to reveal  the mechanisms  by which  amphetamines promote  neurotoxic  actions,  many  studies  were  performed not  only  in  animals  but  also  in  in  vitro  models.  These studies  have  revealed  several  mechanisms  by  which amphetamines  produce  neurotoxic  actions,  though  much  is still  to  be  discovered.  Most  importantly,  the  main  goal  is  to find a therapeutic strategy  that can be useful  to prevent and/ or treat the neurotoxic events induced by amphetamines. When  using  laboratory  animals,  researchers  generally find  that  amphetamines  produce  an  elevation  of  body  core temperature. This issue was neglected  by many researchers in  the  earlier  studies  of  neurotoxicity,  but  subsequent reports  clearly  related  the  hyperthermic  effect  to  the neurotoxicity  of  amphetamines.  Male  rats  treated  with 5  mg/kg  METH  (4  doses,  each  2  h  apart)  at  an  environ­ mental  temperature  of  23°C  presented  striatal  DA  levels 

down  to  70%  of  controls  2  weeks  after  treatment  (Bowyer et  al. 1992). However,  no  changes  in  striatal  DA  levels were observed  in rats  given the  same METH  regimen at  an environmental  temperature  of  4°C.  Furthermore,  striatal TH  activity  was  not  affected  by  10  mg/kg  METH  at  4°C, but  decreased  to  approximately  50%  of  control,  3  days after  the  same  METH  dose  at  23°C.  Thus,  a  cold  envi­ ronmental  temperature  could  prevent  the  long-term depleting  effects  of  METH  on  striatal  DA  levels  (Bowyer et  al. 1992). This  effect  could  also  be  observed  with  other amphetamines  and  in  other  species.  Studies  with  mice demonstrated  that  the  S-(+)  enantiomers  of  METH,  MDA, and  MDMA,  but  not  d-fenfluramine,  produced  damage  to dopaminergic  projections  of  the  striatum  (Miller  and O’Callaghan 1994). Importantly,  the  same  study  verified  an elevation  in  core  temperature  associated  with  exposure  to the  active  S-(+)  enantiomers  of  METH,  MDA,  and MDMA,  whereas  exposure  to  d-fenfluramine  lowered  core temperature.  The  same  authors  used  the  levels  of  striatal DA  and  glial  fibrillary  acidic  protein  (GFAP)  as  indicators of  neurotoxicity.  Mice  treated  at  22°C  ambient  temperature with  S-(+)-METH  (10  mg/kg),  -MDA  (20  mg/kg),  or -MDMA  (20  mg/kg)  every  2  h,  for  a  total  of  4  s.c.  injec­ tions,  showed  an  increase  in  core  temperature  and  caused large  (>75%)  decreases  in  striatal  DA  and  large  (>300%) increases  in  striatal  GFAP  72  h  after  the  last  injection. Lowering  ambient  temperature  from  22  to  15  °C  blocked 

(for  MDA  and  MDMA)  or  severely  attenuated  (for  METH) these  effects  (Miller  and  O’Callaghan 1994). Another report  stated  that  small  changes  in  ambient  temperature produced  marked  changes  in  the  neurotoxicity  of  MDMA 

(Malberg  and  Seiden 1998). Rats  treated  with  MDMA  (20 or  40  mg/kg)  at  ambient  temperatures  of  20-24°C  did  not present  serotonergic  neurotoxicity  in  the  frontal  cortex, 

somatosensory cortex,  hippocampus, or  striatum. However, at  ambient  temperatures  of  26-30°C,  neurotoxicity  was 

seen  and  correlated  with  core  temperature  in  all  regions examined (Malberg and Seiden 1998).

Many  drugs  that  could  prevent  or  attenuate  neurotoxic events also attenuated the hyperthermia elicited by the tested amphetamine.  In  rats,  the  non-competitive  N-methyl-Daspartate  (NMDA)  receptor  antagonist  dizocilpine  blocks depletion  of  5-HT  induced  by  METH  and  p-chloroamphetamine  (Farfel  and  Seiden 1995). The  coadministration  of METH  or  p-chloroamphetamine  with  dizocilpine  results  in hypothermia,  which  can  attenuate  the  neurotoxic  effects. In  mice,  the  antagonist  of  glutamate  receptors  dizocil­ pine  blocked  S-(+)-METH-induced,  -MDA-induced,  and -MDMA-induced  neurotoxicity,  but  promoted  hypothermia. When  the  ambient  temperature  was  elevated  during  this co-treatment,  the  neuroprotective  effects  of  the  antagonist were  markedly  attenuated.  Therefore,  lowering  the  ambient temperature  and  pre-treatment  with  drugs  that  cause

hypothermia in  the mouse  are able  to prevent  or lower  very 

significantly  the  toxic  effects  of  amphetamines  (Miller  and O’Callaghan 1994). Thus,  many  pharmacological  com­ pounds  that  were  considered  neuroprotectors  were  also 

shown to lower the  core body temperature. Therefore,  these compounds  promote  a  protective  effect,  not  by  a  specific pharmacological  effect,  but  simply  because  they  interfere with the hyperthermic effect elicited by amphetamines.

Glutamate is  the most  abundant excitatory  amino acid  in the  CNS  and  is  capable  of  producing  neuronal  damage, which  is  defined  as  excitotoxicity  (Yi  and  Hazell 2006). 

Several  studies  were  designed  to  evaluate  the  role  of excitotoxicity  in  the  neurotoxic  effects  of  amphetamines. One  study  evaluated  the  consequence  of  repeated  admin­ istration  of  either  METH  (7.5  mg/kg;  3  doses  every  2  h, i.p.)  or  MDMA  (13.8  mg/kg;  3  doses  every  2  h,  i.p.)  on  the extracellular  concentrations  of  glutamate  in  freely  moving rats,  using  in  vivo  microdialysis.  These  doses  were  previ­ ously  reported  to  promote  neurotoxicity  to  the  striatum. The  authors  reported  that  METH  increased  the  extracellu­ lar  concentration  of  glutamate  in  the  striatum,  whereas MDMA  did  not  (Nash  and  Yamamoto 1992). It  was reported  that  rats  after  a  single  neurotoxic  dose  of  AMPH 

(30  mg/kg,  i.p.)  did  not  change  glutamate  levels,  but increased  both  glutamine  content  and  glutamine/glutamate ratio  4  h  after  treatment,  in  the  caudate-putamen,  frontal cortex,  and  hippocampus  (Pereira  et  al. 2008). These  data argue  for  an  increase  in  the  glutamate-glutamine  cycle between  neurons  and  glia  promoted  by  AMPH  neurotoxic doses.  The  importance  of  glutamate  in  the  neurotoxicity  of amphetamines  was  highlighted  by  the  fact  that  antagonists of  glutamate  receptors  can  partially  prevent  it.  This  was clearly  observed  in  a  previous  study  with  METH-treated mice  using  an  experimental  paradigm  that  produces  sub­

stantial  neurotoxicity  (5  mg/kg,  i.p.;  three  injections  at  2  h intervals),  with  massive  degeneration  of  striatal  dopami­ nergic  terminals,  associated  with  reactive  gliosis  (Battaglia et  al. 2002). In  this  study,  potent  and  selective  non-com­ petitive  mGlu5  receptor  antagonists  could  attenuate METH-induced  effects,  without  interfering  with  body temperature (Battaglia et al. 2002).

When  testing  the  neuroprotective  effects  of  glutamate  or 5-HT  receptor  antagonists  on  amphetamines  neurotoxic actions  in  animals,  there  is  the  confounding  factor  of hypothermia  promoted  by  these  antagonists.  As  mentioned above,  dizocilpine  lowers  the  core  body  temperature  of animals.  Using  an  in  vitro  approach,  one  can  circumvent this  problem.  Our  laboratory  studies,  in  cultured  rat  cortical neurons,  demonstrated  that M DMA-induced  neuronal  death was  partially  prevented  by  the  NMDA  receptor  antagonist dizocilpine,  in  both  normothermic  (37°C)  and  hyperthermic 

(40°C) conditions (Capela et  al. 2006b). These data suggest

the  involvement  of  excitotoxicity  in  MDMA-induced  neu­

ronal  death.  Also,  using  the  same  in  vitro  model,  we  have 

shown  that  the  selective  5-HT2A-receptor  antagonists 

ketanserin  and  R-96544  afforded  protection  against 

MDMA-induced  death  of  cortical  neurons,  in  a  tempera­

ture-independent manner (Capela et al. 2007a; Capela et al. 

2006b). Indeed,  MDMA  might  elicit  glutamate  excitotox­

icity  either  directly  or  indirectly  via  5-HT2A-receptor-

mediated cell  death (Capela  et al. 2006b). Moreover, in  the 

case  of  MDMA,  the  direct  agonism  to  the  5-HT2A-receptor 

can  promote  neuronal  death,  which  can  be  prevented  by 

5-HT 2A-receptor antagonists (Capela et al. 2007a).

Another  important  finding  that  has  been  revealed  by 

several  studies  is  that  selective  blockade  of  monoamine 

transporters  can  greatly  attenuate  or  even  prevent  the 

neurotoxic  actions  of  amphetamines.  These  uptake  inhibi­

tors  do  not  alter  the  animal  body  temperature  and  do  not 

reverse  hyperthermia  promoted  by  amphetamines.  Adult 

rats  were  treated  with  METH  (10  mg/kg,  i.p.)  4  times  at 

2  h  intervals,  and  3  days  later,  it  could  be  observed  the 

typical  depletion  of  dopaminergic  terminals  and  reduction 

of DA content and astrogliosis in the neostriatum (Pu et al.

1994). In the  same study,  amfonelic acid  (20 mg/kg,  i.p.), a 

DA reuptake  inhibitor, administered  at the  same time  of the 

last  METH  dose,  completely  prevented  its  effects  on 

the  dopaminergic  system,  both  morphologically  and  bio­

chemically  (Pu  et  al. 1994). The  importance  of  the  DA 

transporter  in  mediating  the  neurotoxic  effects  of  METH 

was  tested  in  mice  lacking  DAT.  In  wild-type  (WT)  mice,  4 

injections  of  METH  (15  mg/kg,  s.c.),  each  given  2  h  apart, 

caused  80  and  30%  decrease  in  striatal  DA  and  5-HT 

levels,  respectively,  and  increased  free  radical  formation 

2  days  after  administration  (Fumagalli  et  al. 1998). Con­

versely,  no  significant  changes  were  observed  in  total  DA 

content,  extracellular  DA  levels,  or  free  radical  formation 

in  the  striatum  of  DAT-null  mice  after  METH  adminis­

tration.  These  observations  demonstrate  that  DAT  is 

required  for  METH-induced  striatal  dopaminergic  neuro­

toxicity  (Fumagalli  et  al. 1998). Also  in  the  case  of  AMPH, 

the  DAT  blocker  nomifensine  protected  against  AMPH-

induced  long-term  DA  depletion  in  rats  (Wan  et  al. 2000b). 

Also  for  MDMA,  the  5-HT  transporter  seems  crucial  for 

the  serotonergic  neurotoxicity  of  the  drug.  Administration 

of  fluoxetine  (10  mg/kg  x  2,  i.p.)  or  fluvoxamine  (15  mg/ 

kg  x  2,  i.p.)  to  rats  provided  complete  protection  against 

serotonergic  neurotoxicity  verified  in  the  cortical,  hippo­

campal,  and  striatum  brain  areas  after  MDMA  (15  mg/kg, 

i.p.)  (Sanchez  et  al. 2001). In  another  report,  the  adminis­

tration  of  fluoxetine  (10  mg/kg,  i.p.)  4  h  after  MDMA 

(20  mg/kg,  s.c.)  provided  full  protection  against  MDMA-

induced  serotonergic n eurotoxicity  in  rats ( Shankaran e t al. 

1999).

Another  important  contributing  factor  for  amphetamines neurotoxicity  is  oxidative  stress.  Amphetamines  have  been 

shown  to  promote  oxidative  stress  in  the  brain  of  experi­ mental  animals  and  cultured  neuronal  cells,  and  antioxi­ dants can  attenuate their  neurotoxic actions.  In the  rat brain pretreated  with  desipramine  (10  mg/kg,  i.p.),  an  agent  that inhibits  the  metabolism  of  AMPH,  the  levels  of  2,3-dihydroxybenzoic  acid  (2,3-DHBA),  lipid  peroxidation,  and DA  in  striatal  homogenates  were  examined  7  days  after injection  of  a  single  large  dose  of  AMPH  (7.5  mg/kg,  i.p.) 

(Wan et  al. 2000a). This study  showed that,  in the  striatum, 2,3-DHBA,  and  lipid  peroxidation  were  significantly increased  by  AMPH,  whereas  DA  and  its  metabolites, DOPAC  and  HVA,  were  depleted  (Wan  et  al. 2000a). Another  study  also  proved  that  AMPH  induced  HO*  for­ mation  in  the  rat  striatum,  an  effect  that  might  be  DA related  and  contributes  to  AMPH-induced  neurodegenera­ tion  (Huang  et  al. 1997). The  contribution  of  free  radical formation  for  the  neurotoxic  actions  of  amphetamines  has also  been  confirmed  by  the  protection  afforded  by  the  free radical  scavengers  a-phenyl-A-tert-butyl  nitrone  (PBN) and  N-acetylcysteine  (NAC)  on  AMPH  neurotoxicity.  In rats,  both  antioxidants  could  significantly  attenuate  the long-term  DA  depletion  and  lipid  peroxidation  in  the  stri­ atum at  a dose  range that  did not  block hyperthermia  (Wan et  al. 2006). Moreover,  these  two  neuroprotective  agents completely  inhibited  the  production  of  HO*  after  AMPH infusion into the striatum (Wan et al. 2006).

Methamphetamine  was  also  shown  to  elicit  pro-oxidant processes.  In  rats,  a  dose  of  10  mg/kg  (+)-METH  admin­ istered  i.p.  every  2  h  over  an  8-h  period  increased  lipid peroxidation  and  also  the  formation  of  the  hydroxylated products of salicylate  and D-phenylalanine, as  evidenced by the  elevated  extracellular  concentrations  of  2,3-DHBA  and p-tyrosine,  respectively  (Yamamoto  and  Zhu 1998). In  this 

study,  a  local  perfusion  of  the  iron  chelator  deferroxamine into  the  striatum  attenuated  the  long-term  depletions  of 

striatal  DA  content  produced  by  METH.  Moreover,  pre­ treatment  with  the  spin-trapping  agent  phenylbutylnitrone before  the  METH  injections  attenuated  the  subsequent long-term  depletions  in  striatal  DA  content  (Yamamoto and  Zhu 1998). Additionally,  oxidative  DNA  damage  was also  reported  after  METH.  Pregnant  CD-I  mice  were treated  with  a  single  dose  of  METH  (20  or  40  mg/kg  i.p.) on  gestational  day  14  or  17  resulting  in  enhanced  DNA oxidation  by  at  least  twofold,  determined  by  8-oxoguanine formation,  in  brain  and  liver,  at  1-h  fetal  brains  (Jeng  et  al. 2005). Formation  of  RNS  was  also  reported  in  the  brain  of animals  treated  with  METH.  Mice  treated  with  multiple doses  of  METH  (4  x  10  mg/kg,  2  h  interval)  showed increased  levels  of  3-nitrotyrosine  (3-NT)  in  the  striatum  as compared with  the controls  (Imam et  al. 2001). In the  same 

study,  no  significant  production  of  3-NT  was  observed 

either  in  the  striata  of  neuronal  nitric  oxide  synthase 

knockout  mice  (nNOS-/-)  or  copper-zinc  superoxide  dis-

mutase-overexpressed  transgenic  mice  (SOD-Tg)  treated 

with  similar  doses  of  METH.  The  dopaminergic  damage 

induced  by  METH  treatment  was  also  attenuated  in 

nNOS-/-  or  SOD-Tg  mice.  The  authors  clearly  confirmed 

that  METH  causes  its  neurotoxic  effects  via  the  production 

of ONOO- (Imam et al. 2001).

Several  studies  have  also  confirmed  the  important  role 

of  ROS  formation  in  MDMA  neurotoxicity  (Colado  et  al. 

1997,  1999; Shankaran  et  al. 1999). Administration  of 

MDMA  (15  mg/kg,  i.p.)  to  rats  increased  the  formation  of 

hydroxylated  products  of  salicylate  in  the  hippocampus, 

which  was  prevented  by  the  free  radical  scavenging  agent 

PBN  (120  mg/kg,  i.p.)  (Colado  et  al. 1997). In  a  recent 

study,  it  was  reported  that  adolescent  rats  (post-natal  day 

40,  which  corresponds  to  the  human  adolescence  period) 

exposed  to  a  neurotoxic  binge  administration  of  MDMA 

(10  mg/kg,  i.p.  4  times,  every  2  h)  promoted  oxidative 

stress  to  whole-brain  mitochondria  (Alves  et  al. 2007). 

Moreover,  previous  inhibition  of  MAO-B  by  selegiline 

(2  mg/kg,  i.p.),  at  a  dose  that  did  not  modify  hyperthermia, 

blocked  MDMA-induced  pro-oxidant  deleterious  effects  to 

the  mitochondria,  namely  lipid  and  protein  peroxidation 

and  mitochondrial  DNA  deletions  (Alves  et  al. 2007). This 

finding  argues  for  an  important  role  of  MAO-mediated 

metabolism of monoamines on MDMA neurotoxicity.

These  in  vivo  findings  have  been  also  corroborated  by 

cell  culture  studies.  In  human  neuroblastoma  SH-SY5Y 

cells,  METH  induced  a  decrease  in  mitochondrial  mem­

brane  potential  and  an  increase  in  the  levels  of  ROS,  as 

well  as  a  decrease  in  mtDNA  copy  number  and  mito­

chondrial  proteins  per  mitochondrion.  Importantly,  in  the 

same  study,  the  same  authors  reported  that  vitamin  E 

attenuated  METH-induced  increase  in  intracellular  ROS 

levels  and  mitochondrial  mass  and  prevented  METH-

induced  cell  death  (Wu  et  al. 2007). Also  works  from  our 

group  have  proven  that  antioxidants  can  attenuate  the 

neuronal  death  promoted  by  MDMA,  or  their  metabolites, 

in cultured cortical neurons (Capela et al. 2006b, 2007b).

From  the  above-mentioned  studies,  it  is  possible  to 

conclude  that  ROS/RNS  have  an  important  role  in  the 

neurotoxic  effects  of  amphetamines.  The  origin  of  these 

ROS/RNS  is  still  a  matter  of  debate,  but  clearly  two 

important  sources  of  ROS  are  the  catecholamine  auto­

oxidation  process  and  the  formation  of  hydrogen  peroxide 

in  the  event  of  monoamine  oxidation  by  MAO  (Capela 

et  al. 2009). Concerning  RNS,  as  previously  described, 

formation  of  reactive  nitrogen  species  was  reported  in  the 

brain  of  animals  treated  with  amphetamines.  NO  can  be 

formed  in  the  brain  of  animals  and  then  react  with

superoxide  to  form  ONOO-  a  damaging  neurotoxin (Capela  et  al. 2009). In  contrast  to  other  amphetamines, MDMA  metabolism  leads  to  the  production  of  several highly  reactive  metabolites,  namely  quinone  intermediates, which  can  also  promote  the  formation  of  ROS  and  conse­ quent  oxidative  stress.  In  cultured  cortical  neurons  of  the rat,  the  neurotoxicity  of  nine  MDMA  metabolites:  N-Me-aMeDA,  a-MeDA,  and  their  correspondent  GSH  and  NAC adducts  was  studied  (Capela  et  al. 2006a,  2007b). These studies  confirmed  the  toxicity  of  MDMA  catechol  metab­ olites,  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA  (100-800  pM),  which showed  higher  toxicity,  compared  to  the  parent  compound MDMA.  Both  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA,  like  MDMA, induced  programmed  neuronal  death,  during  long  periods of  exposure  (48  h) ( Capela  et  al. 2006a). The  neurotoxicity of  MDMA  metabolites  was  partially  prevented  by  the antioxidant  NAC  and  potentiated  under  hyperthermic conditions.  In  subsequent  studies,  it  was  tested  the  neuro­ toxicity  of  GSH  and  NAC  conjugates  of  the  catechols N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA  (Capela  et  al. 2007b). GSH and  NAC  conjugates  of  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA induced a delayed concentration-dependent neur onal death, accompanied  by  activation  of  caspase  3,  which  occurred earlier  in  hyperthermic  conditions.  Furthermore,  thioether MDMA  metabolites  time-dependently  increased  the  pro­ duction  of  pro-oxidant  reactive  species,  concentrationdependently  depleted  intracellular  GSH,  and  increased protein-bound  quinones.  In  this  study,  NAC  prevented  the oxidative  stress  and  neuronal  death.  Thus,  it  was  clearly shown  that  MDMA  metabolites  are  more  toxic  than MDMA  and  that  the  conjugates  of  GSH  and  NAC  cate­ chols,  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA,  are  significantly  more neurotoxic  that  the  non-conjugates.  Importantly,  several studies  in  laboratory  animals  have  confirmed  the  neuro­ toxic  potential  of  MDMA  metabolites  (Escobedo  et  al. 2005; Jones  et  al. 2005; Miller  et  al. 1996). Later,  the presence  of  such  metabolites  was  unequivocally  demon­ strated  in  the  brain  of  animals  after  the  administration  of MDMA  (Jones  et  al. 2005). N-Me-a-MeDA  administrated i.p.  to  mice  provoked  long-term  DA  and  5-HT  depletion (Escobedo  et  al. 2005). Intracerebroventricular  (ICV) injections  of  5-(NAC)-a-MeDA  and  5-(GSH)-a-MeDA into rats pro duced neurobehavioral changes  similar to those seen  after  peripheral  administration  of  MDMA/MDA,  as well  as  acute  increases  in  brain  5-HT  and  DA  concentra­ tions  (Miller  et  al. 1996). Another  MDMA  metabolite, 5-(NAC)-N-Me-a-MeDA,  also  produced  acute  behavioral changes  in  rats  similar  to  those  seen  after  peripheral administration  of  MDMA,  and  importantly,  significantly decreased  striatal  and  cortical  concentrations  of  5-HT  and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic  acid  (5-HIAA)  in  a  dose-dependent manner (Jones 2005). From the above-mentioned  studies, it is  possible  to  conclude  that  MDMA  metabolism  leading  to

reactive  thioether  MDMA  metabolites  plays  an  essential role in the neurotoxic events mediated by MDMA.

Neurotoxicity of amphetamines in humans

Studies  in  humans  are  of  striking  importance  to  provide indication  of  doses  or  frequency  regimens  that  may  put amphetamines  users  at  risk  of  neurotoxicity.  Given  the limitations  of  extrapolating  the  results  obtained  in  animal 

studies  to  the  human  situation,  the  definitive  confirmation of  amphetamines  neurotoxic  actions  can  only  be  revealed by  human  studies.  Studies  on  the  long-term  effects  of amphetamines  on  monoaminergic  neurotransmission  in humans are rather based on indirect methods. These reports evaluate  the  levels  of  monoamines  or  their  metabolites  or use  neuroimaging  techniques  to  reveal  the  number  of transporter  binding  sites.  Also,  other  studies  in  humans  try to  correlate  deficits  in  memory  and  learning  with  the  extent of drug abuse.

It is  known that  the sustained  use of  AMPH can  promote psychosis  in  normal  subjects,  uniquely  resembling  the paranoid  form  of  schizophrenia,  as  a  possible  result  of neurotoxic  actions  of  the  drug  (Vollenweider  et  al. 1998). In  10  healthy  human  volunteers,  the  effects  of  high euphorigenic  doses  of  d-AMPH  (0.9-1.0  mg/kg  p.o.)  on regional  cerebral  glucose  metabolism  were  investigated using  PET  (Vollenweider  et  al. 1998). The  study  reported increases  in  cortical  and  subcortical  cerebral  metabolism after  d-AMPH  administration  in  humans,  demonstrating that  relatively  high  doses  (presumably  at  least  1  mg/kg) are  needed  to  increase  cerebral  glucose  metabolism 

(Vollenweider  et  al. 1998). Another  study  using  functional magnetic resonance imaging  was developed to  examine the effects  on  motor  and  verbal  skills,  memory,  and  spatial attention  task  in  18  healthy  volunteers  (Willson  et  al. 2004). Functional  measurements were  obtained at  baseline and  again  at  75  min  after  an  oral  dose  of  25  mg  d-AMPH, which  promoted  decreases  in  brain  activity  in  several regions  during  cognitive  tasks.  These  changes  may  possi­ bly  be  mediated  by  alterations  in  dopaminergic  activation caused by the drug (Willson et al. 2004).

Human  neuroimaging  findings  suggest  that  METH  is neurotoxic  and  may  lead  to  significant  alterations  in  brain 

structures,  accompanied  by  alterations  in  brain  metabolism and  microvasculature  (Schwartz  et  al. 2010; Thompson et  al. 2004b). One  study  published  in  1996  in  Nature Medicine  reported  reduced  levels  of  three  DA  nerve  ter­ minal  markers  (DA,  TH,  and  DAT)  in  post-mortem  stria­ tum  (nucleus  accumbens,  caudate,  putamen)  of  chronic METH  users  (Wilson  et  al. 1996). However,  the  authors 

suggested these depletions were not related to degeneration of  striatal  dopamine  nerve  terminals  (Wilson  et  al. 1996). Using  magnetic  resonance  imaging  and  new  computational

brain-mapping techniques,  a more recent  study showed that METH  users  had  7.8%  smaller  hippocampal  volumes  than control  subjects  and  significant  white  matter  hypertrophy. The  authors  also  report  that  METH  may  selectively  dam­ age  the  medial  temporal  lobe  and,  consistent  with  meta­ bolic  studies,  the  cingulate-limbic  cortex  (Thompson  et  al. 2004b). A more recent  study suggested that  the early use of METH  (in  subjects  who  initiated  use  before  the  age  of  21) was  associated  with  smaller  intracranial  volume  (Schwartz et  al. 2010). Also  using  neuroimaging  techniques,  a  very recent  study  showed  that  METH  users  had  enhanced  cor­ tical  grey  matter  volume  loss  with  age  in  the  frontal, occipital,  temporal,  and  the  insular  lobes,  compared  to controls,  independently  of  METH  usage  patterns  (Nakama et  al. 2011). Additionally,  METH  users  showed  smaller grey  matter  volumes  than  control  subjects  in  several  brain regions. The  authors concluded  that METH  users appear  to show  increased  cortical  grey  matter  loss  with  age,  which raises  the  possibility  of  accelerated  decline  in  mental function (Nakama et al. 2011). The  cerebral  spinal  fluid  (CSF)  of  recreational  MDMA users,  which  had  used  “ecstasy”  on  more  than  25  occa­ sions,  showed  significantly  lower  levels  of  5-HIAA  com­ pared  to  control  subjects  (McCann  et  al. 1994,  1999). Another  report  showed  that  MDMA  users  displayed  mul­ tiple  regions  of  grey  matter  reduction  in  the  neocortical, bilateral  cerebellum,  and  midline  brainstem  brain  regions, potentially  accounting  for  previously  reported  neuropsy­ chiatric  impairments  in  MDMA  users  (Cowan  et  al. 2003). Neuroimaging  techniques,  like  PET,  were  used  in  combi­ nation  with  a  5-HTT  ligand  in  human  “ecstasy”  users, showing  lower  density  of  brain  5-HTT  sites  (McCann  et  al. 1998,  2005,  2008). Other  authors  correlate  the  5-HTT reductions  with  the  memory  deficits  seen  in  humans  with  a history  of  recreational  MDMA  use  (McCann  et  al. 2008). A recent study prosp ectively assessed the  sustained effects of “ecstasy”  use  on  the  brain  in  novel  MDMA  users  using repeated  measurements  with  a  combination  of  different neuroimaging  parameters  of  neurotoxicity.  The  authors concluded  that  low  MDMA  dosages  can  produce  sustained effects  on  brain  microvasculature,  white  matter  maturation, and  possibly  axonal  damage  (de  Win  et  al. 2008). More recently,  5-HTT  binding  was  measured  in  50  control  sub­ jects  and  in  49  chronic  (mean  4  years  of  abuse)  MDMA users  (typically  one  to  two  tablets  bi-monthly)  abstinent from the drug (mean 45 days of abstinence) (Kish et al. 2010). The  authors  suggested  that  the  “typical”/low-dose (one  to  two  tablets/session)  chronic  MDMA  user  might display  a  highly  selective  mild  to  marked  loss  of  5-HTT  in cerebral cortex/hippocampus (Kish et al. 2010). One  must  bear  in  mind  that  most  studies  in  humans are  retrospective  and  conducted  with  polydrug  users, which  is  always  a  confounding  factor.  Also,  the  amount 

of  drug  used  by  each  user  differs  greatly,  and  the  par­ ticipants  in  these  studies  are  very  heterogenic.  Despite  all the  difficulties  regarding  studies  in  humans,  the  vast majority  of  reports  provide  data  to  support  the  idea  that amphetamines  can  promote  deleterious  effects  to  the human brain.

Unsolved issues regarding the neurotoxicity of amphetamines

Despite  the  huge  amount  of  research  on  the  neurotoxicity of  amphetamines,  much  is  still  to  be  clarified.  Indeed,  the neurotoxicity  found  in  studies  with  laboratory  animals cannot  be d irectly  extrapolated  to  the h uman situation.  The long-term  neurotoxic  effects,  reported  by  many,  are  rather regarded by some  authors as brain  adaptations and not  real neurotoxic  events.  Moreover,  the  neurotoxic  mechanisms of  amphetamines  are  still  a  matter  of  debate  (Capela  et  al. 2009).

Several questions remain to be answered:

•  Despite distal  axotomy of  monoaminergic neurons  seen 

in  many  studies,  which  was  not  proven  to  be  fully 

reversible,  are  monoamine  depletions  produced  by 

several  amphetamines  real  measures  of  neurotoxicity 

or transitory events?

•  How  can  pharmacokinetic  differences  among  species, 

and  especially  among  laboratory  animals  and  humans, 

explain  differences  in  terms  of  susceptibility  toward 

neurotoxicity?

•  Can  we  circumvent  the  problem  of  polydrug  abuse  to 

definitively  confirm  the  neurotoxic  events  of  amphet­

amines in human subjects?

•  What  are  the  actions  of  amphetamines  to  the  young 

brain as a result of  intake by children or adolescents and 

their consequences in brain aging?

•  What  therapeutic  strategies  can  be  implemented  to 

prevent  and  treat  the  neurotoxic  events  elicited  by 

amphetamines?

**Liver toxicity**

Hepatocellular  injury  caused  by  amphetamines  has  been known  since  the  beginning  of  its  therapeutic  use.  The  first publication  related  to  hepatotoxicity  in  laboratory  animals dates from 1939  (Ehrich et al. 1939). Harvey and coworkers in  1949  reported  a  fatal  case  of  centrilobular  necrosis  after ingestion of the  contents o f two  inhalers containing  250 mg of  AMPH  each  (Harvey  et  al. 1949). These  initial  reports were followed  by many  others that  became undisputed  evi­ dence of the existence of a cause-effect relationship between AMPH  abuse  and  hepatotoxicity,  both  in  experimental

animals  (Zalis  et  al. 1967) and  in  man  (Jones  et  al. 1994; Kalant and  Kalant 1975; Zalis and  Parmley 1963). Hepato­ cellular  damage  can  occur  with  both  acute  and  chronic AMPH abuse  (Henry et  al. 1992; Jones et  al. 1994; Khakoo et al. 1995).

Because  most  studies  on  the  liver  toxicity  of  the amphetamines  address  MDMA  hepatotoxicity,  this  drug will be especially envisaged in the following sections.

MDMA hepatotoxicity

The  widespread  use  of  MDMA  as  a  recreational  drug  has been  responsible  for  the  appearance  of  several  cases  of acute  liver  failure  in  young  people.  The  first  cases  of hepatotoxicity  associated  with  the  consumption  of  ecstasy were  described  in  1992  by  Henry  and  coworkers,  followed by  many  others  that  confirmed  this  association  (Andreu et al. 1998; Coore 1996; Dykhuizen et  al. 1995; Fidler et  al. 

1996; Jones  et  al. 1994). In  fact,  MDMA  was  reported  as the  second  most  common  cause  of  liver  injury  (after  eth­ anol)  in  young  people  admitted  to  an  intensive  care  unit  in 

Spain  (Andreu  et  al. 1998), with  clinical  features  ranging from  benign  forms,  indistinguishable  from  acute  viral hepatitis  (Dykhuizen  et  al. 1995; Ellis  et  al. 1996), to 

severe  forms,  such  as  liver  dysfunction  due  to  extensive and/or  focal  hepatic  necrosis  (Henry  et  al. 1992; Milroy et  al. 1996), or  even  fulminant  hepatic  failure  requiring urgent  liver  transplantation  (Brauer  et  al. 1997; Caballero et  al. 2002; Ellis  et  al. 1996; Garbino  et  al. 2001; Liechti et  al. 2005). In  fact,  after  exposure  to  MDMA,  the  liver  can 

show dramatic  changes. A  fairly constant  pattern consisting of alterations  in normal  hepatic architecture  due to  necrosis is usually  observed. Necrosis  can be  focal, especially  in the centrilobular  zone,  or  extensive  to  midzonal  regions  and  is usually  accompanied  by  an  acute  inflammatory  response 

surrounding  necrotic  hepatocytes.  Fatty changes  and sinu­

soidal dilatation  are also  occasionally observed.  Cholestatic hepatitis  was  reported  in  some  cases  (Andreu  et  al. 1998; Ellis  et  al. 1996; Hall  and  Henry 2006; Milroy  et  al. 1996). Khakoo  and  coworkers  reported  a  case  of  accelerated hepatic fibrosis following ecstasy abuse (Khakoo et al.

1995). In  some  patients  with  MDMA-related  acute  hepa­ titis,  the  portal  tracts  are  expanded  by  edema  and  inflam­ matory  infiltrates.  In  addition,  focal  hepatocellular  necrosis and  microvesicular  fatty  changes  were  observed  in  pre­

served hepatocytes at  periportal areas (Andreu  et al. 1998). The  hepatocellular  injuries  observed  in  MDMA-intoxicated patients  are  very  similar  to  those  observed  in  heatstroke 

(Wills  et  al. 1976) and  are  probably  related  with  the increase  in  body  temperature  induced  by  MDMA.  In  fact, 

several  subjects  who  developed  hepatic  damage  after  tak­ ing  ecstasy  were  hyperpyrexial  for  many  hours  (Ellis  et  al. 

1996; Henry  et  al. 1992). Therefore,  it  has  been 

Springer

hypothesized that  these hepatotoxic  effects may  be caused 

by  circulatory  collapse and  hypoxic d amage, most  probably 

combined  with  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation 

(DIC)  that  is  a  common  complication  of  heatstroke 

(Mustafa  et  al. 1985). On  the  other  hand,  in  some  cases 

where liver  damage appears  unrelated to  hyperpyrexia, it  is 

unclear  whether  the  damage  is  caused  by  an  idiosyncratic 

reaction  to  MDMA,  interindividual  variability,  and/or  a 

contaminant of the drug (Milroy et al. 1996).

Some  aspects  of  the  pathogenesis  of  liver  injury 

associated  with  amphetamines  remain  poorly  understood, 

such  as  the  variability  in  the  delay  between  the  drug 

consumption  and  the  onset  of  the  first  symptoms.  In  most 

reported  cases,  the  interval  was  of  a  few  days,  but  in 

others,  it  was  2  or  3  weeks  (Henry 1992). Moreover,  the 

severity  of  the  symptoms  and  the  hepatic  lesions  do  not 

seem  to  correlate  either  with  the  duration  of  use  or 

with  the  amount  of  drug  consumed  (Andreu  et  al. 1998; 

Dykhuizen  et  al. 1995; Garbino  et  al. 2001). In  some 

cases,  liver  damage  occurred  after  the  ingestion  of  one  or 

two  tablets,  while  in  others,  it  appeared  only  after  regular 

use  for  weeks  or  months.  As  worst  case  examples,  two 

cases of fulminant hepatitis (Coore 1996; Ellis et al.

1996)   and  two  cases  of  acute  hepatitis  (Dykhuizen  et  al. 

1995; Henry  et  al. 1992) have  been  reported  after  inges­

tion of a single tablet of ecstasy.

In  agreement  with  the  clinical  literature,  in  vivo  studies 

in  an  animal  model  revealed  multiple  foci  of  frank  liver 

cell  necrosis  and  areas  with  multiple  microvesicles  in  the 

cellular  cytoplasm  after  MDMA  administration  (Johnson 

et  al. 2002b). In  another  study  in  mice,  lysosomal  activa­

tion,  mitochondrial  swelling,  intracellular  edema,  and  some 

isolated  necrotic  cells  were  observed  in  liver  sections, 

causing  increased  levels  of  plasma  transaminases  (Pontes 

et  al. 2008a). In  rats,  apoptosis  was  seen  in  the  liver  72  h 

after  ecstasy  use  (Warren  et  al. 2006), corroborating  pre­

vious  in  vitro  findings  in  rat-isolated  hepatocytes  (Montiel-

Duarte  et  al. 2002) and  in  cultured  hepatic  stellate  cells 

(Montiel-Duarte  et  al. 2004). The  induction  of  apoptosis 

was  accompanied  by  a  reduction  in  the  antiapoptotic  pro­

tein  B c1-xl,  mitochondrial  release  of  cytochrome  c,  and 

caspase-3 activation. Moreover,  MDMA has  been shown  to 

induce  collagen  production  on  hepatic  stellate  cells  at  low 

concentrations  (Varela-Rey  et  al. 1999). In  another  in  vivo 

study  in  rats,  MDMA  treatment  caused  cell  necrosis  par­

ticularly  in  portal  areas  with  inflammatory  infiltrate  con­

sisting  in  lymphocytes  and  macrophages  denser  in  portal 

tracts,  especially  after  repeated  MDMA  administration 

(Beitia  et  al. 2000). This  hepatotoxicity  seems  to  be  asso­

ciated  with  an  increased  index  of  lipid  peroxidation  and 

decreased  GSH  levels  (Beitia  et  al. 2000; Carvalho  et  al. 

2002a; Johnson et  al. 2002b; Ninkovic et  al. 2004), and the 

susceptibility  to  these  effects  seems  to  be  increased  by

antioxidant  deficiency  (Johnson  et  al. 2002b), thus  sug­ gesting that MDMA can induce oxidative stress in the liver.

Mechanisms of amphetamines hepatotoxicity

The  mechanisms  involved  in  liver  damage  induced  by amphetamines  are  complex  and  still  not  completely understood.  A  variety  of  hypothesis  have  been  proposed including  the  increased  efflux  of  neurotransmitters,  the oxidation  of  biogenic  amines,  hyperthermia,  a  possible direct  effect  of  amphetamines  and/or  reactive  metabolites, the  phenomenon  of  mitochondrial  impairment,  and  apop­ tosis  [reviewed  in  (Carvalho  et  al. 2010)]. In  addition, genetic  polymorphism  of  metabolizing  enzymes  (particu­ larly  CYP2D6),  polydrug  abuse,  and  environmental  fea­ tures  accompanying  illicit  amphetamine  use  may  increase the risk for liver complications. Metabolism  seems  to  be  an  important  factor  in  the induction  of  hepatic  injury.  It  has  been  shown  that d-AMPH  is  activated  by  CYP2D  isoenzymes  into  a  reac­ tive  intermediate  (probably  an  epoxide),  which  reacts  with GSH  to  form  (glutathione-S-yl)-p-hydroxyamphetamine. Our  group  previously  described  that  d-AMPH  depletes GSH levels  in the  mouse liver  (Carvalho et  al. 1993) and in freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (Carvalho et al. 1996, 1997), which was  prevented by  pre-treatment with  the CYP inhibitor metyrapone (Carvalho et al. 1996). Similar  to  d-AMPH,  MDMA  is  metabolized  with formation  of  GSH  conjugates,  namely  2-(glutathione-S-yl)a-MeDA,  5-(glutathione-S-yl)-a-MeDA,  and  2,5-bis(glutathione-S-yl)-a-MeDA  (Carvalho  et  al. 2004a; Hiramatsu et  al. 1990; Miller  et  al. 1997). However,  the  mechanism  of formation  of  these  adducts  differs  from  the  one  proposed for  d-AMPH  because  it  involves  the  formation  of  a  cate­ chol,  which  after  oxidation  to  quinone  reacts  rapidly  with thiol  groups  (Fig. 5). The  potential  role  of  the  oxidative metabolites  in  MDMA-elicited  hepatotoxicity  was  studied for  the  first  time  by  our  group  using  freshly  isolated  rat hepatocyte  suspensions  as  in  vitro  model  (Carvalho  et  al. 2004a, b). In  these  studies,  the  effects  of  MDMA  and  its major  hepatic-derived  metabolites  MDA,  N-Me-a-MeDA, and  a-MeDA  on  cell  viability,  GSH  levels,  and  on  the activities  of  GR,  GPX,  and  GST  were  evaluated.  MDMA and  the  N-demethylated  metabolite  MDA  induced  a  timeand  concentration-dependent  GSH  depletion,  but  had  a negligible  effect  on  cell  viability,  or  on  the  antioxidant enzymes  activities.  GSH  depletion  following  MDMA exposure  has  been  reported  in  several  other  studies  con­ ducted  in  mice  (Carvalho  et  al. 2001) and  rat  (Beitia  et  al. 1999; Pontes  et  al. 2008b) hepatocytes.  Glutathione depletion  was  clearly  enhanced  upon  exposure  to  the demethylenated  metabolites  N-Me-a-MeDA  and  a-MeDA and accompanied by  a loss in  cell viability and  decreases in 

the  antioxidant  enzyme  activities.  GSH  plays  a  crucial  role in  the  processes  of  cellular  protection  against  electrophilic compounds,  ROS,  and  RNS  formed  within  the  cells 

(DeLeve and Kaplowitz 1991).

In  spite  of  the  different  mechanisms  involved,  it  seems that  depletion  of  hepatic  GSH  levels  may  be  an  initial  step for  the  hepatotoxic  action  reported  for  different  ampheta­ mines.  Disruption  in  thiol  redox  homeostasis  may  result  in loss of  protein function  and initiation  of a  cascade of  events leading  to  oxidative  damage.  In  accordance,  our  group 

showed that  ascorbic acid  or NAC  prevented cell  death and GSH  depletion  induced  by  N-Me-a-MeDA  in  rat  hepato­ cytes  (Carvalho  et  al. 2004b). Depletion  of  hepatic  GSH  in cells exposed  to amphetamines  did not  lead to  an alteration in  cell  viability  or  lipid  redox  status  (Carvalho  et  al. 1996, 2004a, b), but  disruption  of  liver  GSH  status  may  most likely  affect  susceptibility  to  amphetamines  when  cells  are exposed  to  other  toxic  insults  that  occur  simultaneously  in vivo as, for example, hyperthermia.

In  fact,  since  hyperthermia  and  metabolism  of  amphet­ amines  occur  in  vivo,  it  seems  reasonable  to  surmise  that these  situations  are  potentially  lethal  and  most  certainly contribute  to  the  hepatotoxicity  that  has  been  reported  in humans.  The  influence  of  hyperthermia  in  amphetamines hepatotoxicity  was  evaluated  by  our  group  in  freshly  iso­ lated  rat  (Carvalho  et  al. 1997) and  mouse  hepatocytes 

(Carvalho  et  al. 2001) and,  more  recently,  in  primary  cul­ tured  rat  hepatocytes  (Pontes  et  al. 2008b). In  all  cell models,  hyperthermic  conditions  potentiated  the  hepato­ toxic  effects  of  amphetamines  namely  those  related  to oxidative  stress:  depletion  of  GSH  levels,  lipid  peroxida­ tion, and loss of cell viability.

Recent studies have suggested that mitochondria may  be important  target  organelles  for  MDMA  hepatotoxicity 

(Burrows et al. 2000; Moon et al. 2008; Nakagawa et al. 2009). A  recent  study  conducted  by  Nakagawa  and coworkers  shows  that  the  exposure  of  isolated  hepatic mitochondria  to  MDMA  causes  mitochondrial  impairment and  induction  of  the  mitochondrial  permeability  transition 

(MPT)  accompanied  by  mitochondrial  depolarization  and depletion  of  ATP  through  uncoupling  of  oxidative  phos­ phorylation  (Nakagawa  et  al. 2009). It  was  previously 

shown  by  Beitia  and  coworkers  that  MDMA  induces  a concentration-  and  time-dependent  ATP  depletion  in  iso­ lated rat hepatocytes (Beitia et al. 1999).

Generation  of  ROS  may  play  a  role  in  mitochondrial dysfunction  (Brown  and  Yamamoto 2003). However,  it  is 

still  unknown  whether  the  generation  of  ROS  in  hepato­ cytes  incubated  with  MDMA  depends  on  either  disturbance of  the  mitochondrial  respiratory  chain  or  redox  cycles formed  between  o-quinones  and  their  semiquinones derived  from  MDMA  metabolism.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is plausible  that  MDMA  and/or  its  reactive  metabolites

(especially  the  quinone  metabolites)  may  inhibit  the mitochondrial  function  by  directly  interacting  with  mito­ chondrial  proteins,  as  recently  demonstrated  with  cyto­ chrome  c  (Fisher  et  al. 2007). In  addition,  MDMA metabolites  can  indirectly  cause  mitochondrial  dysfunction through  increased  oxidative/nitrosative  stress.  Moon  and coworkers  have  shown  that  MDMA  causes  oxidative inactivation  of  key  mitochondrial  enzymes,  which  most likely  leads  to  mitochondrial  dysfunction  and  subsequent liver  damage.  Among  these,  the  activities  of  mitochondrial 

3-ketoacyl-CoA  thiolases  (involved  in  ATP  production  via the  fat  degradation  pathway)  and  ATP  synthase  were  sig­ nificantly  inhibited  following  MDMA  exposure  (Moon et  al. 2008), suggesting  that  hepatocytes  may  not  properly carry  out  many  cellular  functions  and  eventually  undergo the necrotic cell death process.

The effects caused by  the consumption of ampheta mines can be conditioned by a plethora of factors that converge in a certain  individual  on  a  certain  moment.  In  addition  to  the 

specific  factors  raised  previously,  behavioral  and  environ­ mental  factors  accompanying  illicit  amphetamine  use  may increase  the  risk  for  liver  complications.  For  instance, MDMA has  become a  popular recreational  drug of  abuse at nightclubs and  rave or  techno parties,  where it  is combined with  intense  physical  activity  (“all-night  dancing”),  crow­ ded  conditions  (aggregation),  high  ambient  temperature, poor hydration,  loud noise,  and is  commonly taken  together with  other  stimulant  “club  drugs”  and/or  alcohol  (Parrott 2006; Von Huben et al. 2007; Walubo and Seger 1999). This combination is  probably the  main reason  why it  is generally 

seen  an  increase  in  toxicity  events  at  rave  parties  since  all these  factors  are  thought  to  induce  or  enhance  the  toxicity 

(particularly the hyperthermic response) of MDMA.

Finally,  one  should  keep  in  mind  that  amphetamine 

street drugs  such as  ecstasy are  manufactured in  clandes­ tine  laboratories  and  the  content  of  drug  tablets  is  often dependent  on  the  source  (EMCDDA 2007). Thus,  the possible  presence  of  potentially  hepatotoxic  contaminants in the individual batch of the drug can never be excluded.

**Cardiotoxicity of amphetamines**

The  cardiovascular  toxicity  of  amphetamines  results mostly  from  the  increased  release  of  catecholamines  and 5-HT  into  the  synaptic  cleft  and  the  blood  stream  (Milroy et  al. 1996). As  noted  above,  amphetamines  act  as  highly potent  releasers  of  monoamines  in  the  CNS.  Although  the cardiovascular  system  is  mainly  regulated  by  the  auto­ nomic  system,  the  CNS  pathways  can  easily  interfere  with cardiac  homeostasis  (Costa  et  al. 2011). Importantly,  the NA  pathways  of  the  brain  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  regu­ lation of cardiovascular functions (Costa et al. 2011).

In  addition,  recent  evidence  points  to  the  involvement  of 

secondary  mechanisms  in  the  development  of  amphet­

amine-induced  cardiotoxic  effects,  including  metabolic 

bioactivation  and  hyperthermia.  The  cardiovascular  effects 

reported  for  the  three  drugs  envisaged  by  this  review  are 

summarized below.

Amphetamine cardiotoxicity

Amphetamine  is  a  sympathomimetic  agent  that  stimulates 

catecholamine  release,  particularly  DA  and  NA,  from  the 

pre-synaptic  nerve  terminals.  The  plasma  membrane 

uptake  transporters  and  the  monoamine  secretory/synaptic 

vesicles  are  involved  in AMPH  actions (Sulzer  et al . 2005). 

Several  experiments  with  different  study  models  (e.g.,  in 

vivo,  using  electrochemical  detection  techniques;  using 

mutated  transporters;  using  reserpine  in  neuronal  cultures) 

are  all  consistent  with  the  ability  of  AMPH  to  act  on  both 

vesicular  and  plasma  membrane  transporters,  and  accord­

ingly,  to  affect  monoamine  pools  both  in  synaptic  vesicles 

and  within  the  cytosol  (Sulzer  et  al. 2005). AMPH  also 

inhibits  MAO  in  perfused  rat  heart  (Leitz  and  Stefano 

1971), although  the  catecholamine  levels  only  increase 

significantly  when  this  inhibition  is  combined  with  the 

inhibition  of  VMAT  (Costa  et  al. 2011). AMPH  was  rec­

ognized  as  a  VMAT2  inhibitor,  although  Brown  and 

coworkers suggested  that the  response to  amphetamines is 

indirect  and  that  the  apparent  inhibition  of  VMAT2  is  due 

to  D 2   autoreceptor  activation  following  DA  release  (Brown 

et  al. 2002). The  activation  of  the  D2  autoreceptors  led  to 

VMAT2  redistribution  to  endosomes  or  other  compart­

ments (Brown et al. 2002).

Peripherally,  AMPH-mediated  release  is  greater  for  NA 

than  DA  (Florin  et  al. 1994). In  addition,  d-AMPH  is  a 

potent  inhibitor o f N A  reuptake,  which  may b e t he b asis fo r 

its greater  potency over  the R-(—)  enantiomer (Sulzer  et al. 

2005). Reporting  to  the  interference  of  neurotransmitters  or 

hormones,  which  can  have  direct  or  indirect  actions  on 

cardiac  function,  AMPH  increased  extracellular  NA  in  the 

brain  of  male  Sprague-Dawley  rats  (Florin  et  al. 1994). 

Furthermore,  AMPH  increases  extracellular  NA  through 

reuptake  blockade,  which  predominates  at  lower  doses,  or 

through  the  release  of  NA,  which  becomes  more  prevalent 

at  higher  doses.  In  rat  brain  slices,  AMPH  was  shown  to 

raise  extracellular  DA  levels  by  inducing  stimulation­

independent  DA  efflux  via  reverse  transport  through  the 

DA  transporter  and  by  inhibiting  DA  re-uptake  (Florin 

et  al. 1994). In  contrast,  a  more  recent stu dy  indicated  that 

AMPH  decreases  stimulation-dependent  vesicular  DA 

release  (Schmitz  et  al. 2001). Furthermore,  AMPH  was 

shown  to  induce  an  increase  in  TH  activity  (Mandell  and 

Morgan 1970), which  further  increases  the  catecholamine 

availability,  and  thus,  the  stimulation  of  adrenoceptors  in

the  CNS.  This  adrenoceptors-stimulation  indirectly  triggers alterations in the cardiovascular function (Costa et al. 2011). On  the  other  hand,  the  direct  action  on  heart receptors  or  the  direct  action  of  the  molecules  on  the myocardial  tissue  can  cause  stress  cardiomyopathy,  myo­ cardial  infarction,  and  tachycardia,  among  other  cardio­ vascular disorders (Costa et al. 2011). Besides its  use as  a drug  of abuse,  AMPH is  also pres­ ently  used  as  a  therapeutic  agent  in  the  attention-deficit/ hyperactivity  disorder  and  in  clinical  trials  for  stroke (Winterstein  et  al. 2009). Cardiotoxicity  (manifested  as cardiomyopathy,  acute  myocardial  infarction/necrosis, heart  failure,  or  arrhythmia)  after  the  use  or  misuse  of AMPH  has  been  documented  in  both  situations  (Alsidawi et  al. 2011; Bashour 1994; Gandhi  et  al. 2005; Hung  et  al. 2003; Jacobs 2006; Marks 2008; Smith  et  al. 1976; Sprigg et al. 2007; Sylvester and Agarwala 2012; Waksman et al. 2001). Presently,  most  of  the  reports  dealing  with  severe cardiac  effects  related  to  AMPH  use  arise  from  its  thera­ peutic use. The clinical trials and human studies that used AMPH as a therapeutic  agent  demonstrated  several  cardiovascular effects.  To  assess  long-term  cardiovascular  effects  of  an extended  release  formulation  containing  mixed  amphet­ amine salts, a study was performed in 223 otherwise healthy adults  with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  com­ bined subtype. The patients were exposed up to 24 months to the  mixed  amphetamine  salts  extended  release  formulation (20-60  mg/day).  In  these  doses,  mean  changes  in  resting sitting  diastolic  blood  pressure  and  systolic  blood  pressure were  small  and  not  considered  clinically  significant  within the  group  analysis.  However,  seven  subjects  discontinued the  medication  due  to  cardiovascular  events,  namely hypertension  (n  =  5)  and  palpitation/tachycardia  (n  =  2) (Weisler et  al. 2005). A phase  II randomized  (1:1), double­ blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  was  conducted  in  post-ischemic  stroke  patients,  to  determine  the  effects  of  AMPH. Thirty-three  subjects  were  recruited,  aged  33-88  (mean  71) years, 52% men,  4-30 (median 15)  days post-stroke (Sprigg et al. 2007). Sixteen patients were randomized to placebo and seventeen  to  AMPH  treatment.  Subjects  received  d-AMPH (5  mg  initially,  followed  by  10  mg  for  10  subsequent administrations  with  3-  or  4-day  intervals)  or  placebo  in addition  to  inpatient  physiotherapy.  Peripheral  and  central systolic  blood  pressure  and  heart  rate  were  11.2  mm  Hg (P  =  0.03),  9.5  mm  Hg  (P  =  0.04),  and  7  beats  per  minute (P  =  0.02)  higher,  respectively,  with  AMPH,  compared with placebo (Sprigg et al. 2007). A  mixed  AMPH  salts  extended  release  formulation  with the  brand  name  “Adderall  XR”  commonly  prescribed  for children  and  adolescents  with  attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  has  resulted  in  several  reports  of  cardiac toxic  effects.  A  15-year-old  boy,  without  previous  known 

cardiac  abnormalities,  suffered  a  myocardial  infarction after  starting  Adderall  XR,  which  was  presumably  sec­ ondary to an acute vasospasm (Sylvester and Agarwala 2012). In  another  report,  a  patient  developed  cardiomyop­ athy  after  receiving  a  therapeutic  course  of  d-AMPH.  The cardiac  function  of  the  patient  deteriorated  to  the  point  of heart  failure,  which  required  heart  transplantation  (Marks 2008).

Takotsubo  cardiomyopathy,  also  known  as  stressinduced  cardiomyopathy,  is  a  severe  and  reversible  left ventricular  dysfunction  extending  beyond  the  territory  of  a 

single epicardial  coronary artery  in the  absence of  coronary artery  disease  or  pheochromocytoma.  Takotsubo  cardio­ myopathy  has  been  reported  after  AMPH  use.  A  19-yearold  girl  was  diagnosed  with  Takotsubo  cardiomyopathy after  ingesting  30  Adderall  tablets  (Alsidawi  et  al. 2011). Also, a  25-year-old woman  was presented  with shortness  of breath  to  the  emergency  room  of  a  hospital,  shortly  after inhalation  of  amphetamines.  Her  vitals  revealed  sinus tachycardia  of  140  beats  per  min  and  elevated  blood pressure  of  160/90  mmHg  with  plasma  troponin  levels  of 7  ng/mL  and  was  diagnosed  with  Takotsubo  cardiomyop­ athy  (Movahed  and  Mostafizi 2008). The  etiology  of  stress cardiomyopathy  is  still  a  matter  of  debate,  but  it  is  often 

suggested to be secondary to a  catecholamine surge (Costa et  al. 2011), thus  corroborating  AMPH  sympathomimetic effects.  In  fact,  AMPH-induced  tachycardia  and  hyperten­

sion  could  have  been  the  trigger  of  reverse  apical ballooning  in  these  two  reports.  In  conscious  coronary 

sinus-cannulated  dogs,  the  administration  of  d-AMPH 

[0.1  mg  x  kg-1  x  10  min  (i.v.)]  significantly  elevated mean  arterial  pressure  (+30%)  and  increased  coronary 

sinus and  peripheral venous  NA concentrations,  events that indicate  neurotransmitter  release  in  the  heart  upon  AMPH administration (Lynch et al. 2009).

There are  several papers  reporting AMPH  toxicity toward the cardiovascular  system in  a drug  abuse scenario.  AMPH causes  myocardial  infarction,  and  coronary  spasm,  among other  cardiovascular  effects  (Bashour 1994; Brennan  et  al. 2004; Hung  et  al. 2003; Waksman  et  al. 2001). Coronary artery rupture associated with A MPH intake caused massive infarction,  extremely  depressed  left  ventricular  perfor­ mance, and hemodynamic instability with acute severe pump failure  in  a  28-year-old  man,  who  required  heart  transplant 

(Zebis  et  al. 2007). After  repeated  administration  of d-AMPH,  in  a  context  of  drug  abuse,  a  45-year-old  woman developed congestive  heart failure  (Smith et  al. 1976). This woman  had  no  evidence  of  coronary  heart  disease,  valve disease, or other  demonstrable cause of  heart failure (Smith et al. 1976). Jacobs reported 6 cases  of young persons who died unexpectedly after the chronic abuse of amphetamines. Death causes were  not attributed to  a lethal intoxication,  but to  an  acute  myocardial  necrosis,  a  right  ventricle  rupture,  a

cardiomyopathy,  or  an  arrhythmia,  since  AMPH  consump­ tion was  ignored or  neglected upon  first medical  or forensic evaluation (Jacobs 2006).

Methamphetamine cardiotoxicity

Cardiovascular events are frequently invol ved in the medical complications  and  fatalities  associated  with  METH  abuse. Methamphetamine  elicits  rapid  tachycardia  in  humans 

(Perez-Reyes et al. 1991a). In 2005, Newton and  coworkers made  a  study  with  11  non-treatment-seeking  METHdependent  volunteers,  which  received  a  single  i.v.  30  mg METH dose.  Subjective and  cardiovascular responses  were assessed for 30 and 60 min and revealed a rapid increase in 

systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as an increase in heart  rate  that  persisted  for  several  hours  (Newton  et  al. 2005a). However, METH use has more drastic consequences than  these  transient  effects.  Cerebral  stroke,  hemorrhage, and  hypertension  are  among  the  vascular  complications associated  with  METH  abuse  (Barr  et  al. 2006; Kaye  et  al. 2007). Post-mortem  studies  show that  METH causes  myo­ cardial  infarction,  arrhythmias,  cardiomyopathy,  and  ven­ tricular  hypertrophy  (Bhave  and  Goldschlager 2011; Hong et  al. 1991; Ito  et  al. 2009; Jacobs 1989; Karch 2011; Yeo et al. 2007). In fact,  METH causes  cardiovascular problems in  young  individuals,  in  which  these  type  of  complications are  relatively  uncommon  (Bhave  and  Goldschlager 2011; Karch 2011; Yeo et al. 2007).

In  child-bearing  white  women  in  California,  the  con­

sumption  of  METH  was  estimated  to  be  higher  than  1% 

(Vega et  al. 1993) and was  responsible for  maternal deaths due  to  intracerebral  hemorrhage  and  cardiovascular  col­ lapse, among  other problems  (Catanzarite and  Stein 1995). Yeo  and  coworkers  observed  an  association  between METH  use  and  cardiomyopathy  in  patients  with  age  less than  45  years  (Yeo  et  al. 2007). In  their  patient  cohort, every  4  out  of  10  patients  with  cardiomyopathy  aged  lower than  45  years  had  a  history  of  METH  use.  Most  relevant, they  concluded  that  patients  with  METH-associated  car­ diomyopathy have a more severe disease compared to other non-ischemic  cardiomyopathies.  Patients  that  use  METH have  a  significantly  lower  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction compared  to  cardiomyopathy  patients  without  METH  use 

(Yeo  et  al. 2007). These  data  suggest  that  young  patients who  use  METH  are  not  only  at  a  higher  risk  of  developing cardiomyopathy  but  also  of  developing  a  more  severe f orm of  cardiomyopathy  (Ito  et  al. 2009; Yeo  et  al. 2007). Even 

so,  some  observations  suggest  that  myocardial  pathology may  be  reversible  with  early  cessation  of  METH  use 

(Jacobs 1989).

As  described  for  other  amphetamines,  METH  abuse  is also  often  characterized  by  a  repeated  pattern  of  frequent drug use  (binge) followed  by a  period of  abstinence. Varner 

<£) Springer

and  colleagues  made  a  “binge”  administration  of  METH  to 

conscious  rats  (Varner  et  al. 2002) to  mimic  the  binge 

METH  abuse  in  humans.  The  authors  used  radiotelemetry 

to record  the cardiovascular  responses elicited  during three 

successive  METH  binges  (3  mg/kg,  twice  a  day  for 

4  days).  Each  binge  was  followed  by  a  10-day  METH-free 

period.  The  heart  rate  responses  elicited  by  METH  were 

similar  within  and  among  the  three  binges  and  character­

ized  by  pressor  effects  with  biphasic  heart  rate  responses 

consisting  of  an  initial  bradycardia  followed  by  tachycardia 

(Varner  et  al. 2002). In  rats,  the  binge  administration  of 

METH sensitizes  them to  the pressor  effects of  the drug  as 

blood  pressure  increased  in  the  second  and  third  adminis­

tration  (Varner  et  al. 2002). This  result  clearly  demon­

strates  an  adaptation  of  the  sympathomimetic  system  after 

amphetamines repeated use.

Mechanistically,  METH  exerts  multiple  pharmacologi­

cal  effects  via  different  molecular  processes  as  referred  in 

the  previous  sections.  Methamphetamine  mainly  acts  on 

the  CNS  causing  non-exocytotic  release  of  monoamine 

neurotransmitters,  including  DA,  NA,  and  5-HT  (Sulzer 

et al. 2005). The increased levels of monoamines caused by 

METH  also  results  from  its  ability  to  interfere  with 

monoamine  reuptake  transporters,  decrease  the  activity  of 

VMAT  and  MAO,  and  increase  the  activity  and  expression 

of TH  (Brown et  al. 2002; Guilarte et  al. 2003; Mandell and 

Morgan 1970; Melega  et  al. 2008; Sandoval  et  al. 2003). 

As a result of these combined mechanisms, METH acts as a 

highly  potent  releaser  of  monoamines  in  the  CNS. 

Although  the  cardiovascular  system  is  mainly  regulated  by 

the  autonomic  system,  the  CNS  pathways  easily  interfere 

with  cardiac  homeostasis  (Costa  et  al. 2011). Importantly, 

the  CNS  pathways  of  NA  play  a  crucial  role  in  the  regu­

lation  of  cardiovascular  functions  (Costa  et  al. 2011), and 

as  METH  affects  these  pathways,  it  can  be  easily  under­

stood  how  METH  greatly  modifies  the  cardiovascular 

system through its action in the CNS.

Methamphetamine  has  been  proven  not  only  to  promote 

neurotransmitter release  in the  nervous system,  but system 

and  several  evidences  suggest  that  METH  exposure  leads 

to  high  catecholamines  levels  in  the  peripheral  organs. 

Methamphetamine stimulates  the release of  catecholamines 

and  5-HT  from  the  adrenal  medulla  and  sympathetic  nerve 

terminals  (Makisumi  et  al. 1998). These  events  cause 

activation  of  central  and  peripheral  a-  and  /1-adrenergic 

autonomic  receptors.  Methamphetamine  has  a  significantly 

greater  elimination  half-life  than  many  other  psychostim­

ulants  leading  to  effects  that  last  substantially  longer  in  all 

systems  (Fowler  et  al. 2007). Immediate  side  effects  in 

peripheral  organs,  which  result  partly  from  the  effects  of 

METH on  adrenaline and  NA release  by the  adrenal glands 

(Makisumi  et  al. 1998), may  lead  to  increased  blood 

pressure,  hyperthermia,  stroke,  and  cardiac  arrhythmia

(Barr  et  al. 2006; Kaye  et  al. 2007). Methamphetamine  is also  a  weak  inhibitor  of  MAO  (Suzuki  et  al. 1980) and decreases  the  activity  of  VMAT  (Brown  et  al. 2002). The combination  of  both  favors  catecholamine  accumulation (Costa  et  al. 2011). Autopsy  studies  of  METH  users  have shown  contraction b and  necrosis i n  the m yocardium, which is  also  normally  seen  after  catecholamine  toxicity  corrob­ orating  the  biogenic  amine  involvement  (Islam  et  al. 2009; Karch 2011). Catecholamines  excess  can  conceivably result  in  cardiomyopathy  through  recurrent  coronary vasospasm,  tachycardia,  hypertension, a ccelerated athero ­ sclerosis,  and/or  direct  myocardial  toxicity  (Costa  et  al. 2011). Importantly,  the  surge  of  catecholamines  in  the presence  of  MAO  inhibition  and/or  oxidative  stress  favors the  autoxidation  of  catecholamines,  which  potentiates  heart injury (Costa et al. 2007, 2011). Methamphetamine  cardiotoxicity  is  also  associated  with oxidative  damage.  A  recent  publication  showed  that  4 METH  administrations  (3  mg/kg,  i.v.  for  4  days,  separated by  a  10-day  drug-free  period)  in  rats  produced  eccentric left  ventricular  hypertrophy,  significantly  impaired  the systolic  function  (decreased  fractional  shortening,  ejection fraction,  and  adjusted  maximal  power),  and  produced  sig­ nificant  diastolic  dysfunction  (Lord  et  al. 2010). Dihydro­ ethidium  staining  showed  that  METH  significantly increased  (285%)  the  levels  of  ROS  in  the  left  ventricle. Treatment  with  the  SOD  mimetic,  tempol  (2.5  mM),  in  the drinking  water  prevented  METH-induced  left  ventricular dilation  and  systolic  dysfunction.  However,  tempol  did  not prevent  the  diastolic  dysfunction.  Also,  tempol  signifi­ cantly  reduced,  but  did  not  eliminate,  dihydroethidium staining  in  the  left  ventricle,  thus  showing  that  oxidative stress  plays  a  significant  role  in  mediating  METH  cardio­ toxicity  (Lord  et  al. 2010). Methamphetamine-induced oxidative damage  might be  also related  to the  high levels  of catecholamines  induced  by  the  interaction  of  METH  with neurotransmitter  transporters.  Another  important  factor  that may  contribute  to  oxidative  stress  is  inflammation  (Islam et  al. 2009). The  hearts  from  rats  treated  with  a  METH binge  administration  regimen  showed  focal  inflammatory infiltrates  with  abundant  monocytes  and  occasional  necro­ tic  foci  (Varner  et  al. 2002). The  self-perpetuating  cycle  of inflammation,  oxidative  stress,  and  mitochondrial  dys­ function  initiated  by  catecholamine  release  may  extend well  beyond  the  acute  pharmacodynamic  (PD)  effects  of METH  and  could  represent  an  underlying  and  potentially progressive  degenerative  process.  In  particular,  the  mito­ chondrial  dysfunction,  the  oxidative  and  nitrosative  stress (evaluated  by  tyrosine  nitration)  (Lord  et  al. 2010), and inflammation  (Islam  et  al. 2009; Varner e t a l. 2002) caused by  the  METH-induced  catecholamine  surge  is  crucial  to impair  heart  function,  which  is  particularly  redox  sensitive (Costa  et  al. 2011). It  is  well  known  that  the  phagocytic 

response  can  exacerbate  the  catecholamine-induced  oxi­ dative  stress  and  leads  to  catecholamine  auto-oxidation 

(Costa  et  al. 2011), which,  on  the  other  hand,  causes alterations  in  cardiac  proteins  and  energetic  metabolism 

(Costa et al. 2007, 2009).

Both  enantiomers  (11C  S-(+)-  and  R-(—)-METH) 

showed  rapid  and  high  uptake  in  the  heart,  as  shown  by comparative  PET  studies  in  non-human  primates,  which may a ccount  for some  of the  cardiac toxic  effects o f METH 

(Fowler et  al. 2007). Fowler and  coworkers did  not observe any  significant  differences  in  the  distributions  of  METH enantiomers  in  the  heart.  S-(+)-Methamphetamine  pre­

sented  a  high  initial  distribution  to  the  heart  (0.059%/cm3 at  0.21  min  after  injection)  and  a  short  residence  time  in the  heart  (a  half-time  of  approximately  0.5  min  from  peak) in baboons  (Fowler et  al. 2007). In the  heart of humans,  the cardiac  uptake  of  METH  occurred  fast,  within  55-60  s, while  the  clearance  (half-peak  clearance)  was  intermediate 

(16  min)  (Volkow  et  al. 2010). The  heart  has  lower  total METH  uptake  than  other  organs  (2.6%  of  an  i.v.  injected dose  one  min  after  administration),  and  its  maintenance  in heart was very short-lasting in humans (Volkow et al. 2010). This was unexpected since cardiovascular events are among the  most frequent  medical complications  reported in METH  abusers  (Kaye  et  al. 2007). Nonetheless,  the  good temporal  correspondence  between  METH  fast  accumula­ tion  in  heart  (peaks  at  60  s)  and  the  fast  increase  in  blood pressure  induced  by  this  drug  (peaks  at  60  s  after  i.v. administration)  (Newton  et  al. 2005a) suggests  that  METH may  also  directly  affect  cardiac  tissue,  as  demonstrated  by 

studies  in cultured  adult rat ventricular  myocytes  (He 1995; Maeno  et  al. 2000a,  b). In  primary  cultures  of  adult  rat myocytes  established  under  serum-free  conditions  and incubated  24  h  with  METH  (0.01  and  1  mM),  cellular granulation  and  swelling,  myocyte  hypercontraction,  bro­ ken  cellular  membrane,  and  cellular  destruction  were observed  under  the  light  microscope.  Under  the  same conditions  of  incubation,  electron  microscopy  revealed 

swelling  and  irregular  mitochondria  with  disrupted cristaes,  clump  of  sarcomeres  with  nearly  complete  loss  of organized  contractile  elements,  injury  of  intracellular membrane  system,  and  dissolution of  myofibrils  (He 1995). In  isolated  adult  rat  ventricular  cardiomyocytes  incubated with  METH  (0.05,  0.1,  and  0.5  mM)  for  7  days,  myocyte 

size  varied  and  microtubular  actin  structures  showed  signs of  injury  (Maeno  et  al. 2000b). In  another  study,  the incubation  with  METH  (0.05  and  0.1  mM)  for  7  days  after a  6-day  period  of  normal  culture  led  to  a  larger  cross­

surface  area  of  isolated  adult  rat  ventricular  cardiomyo­ cytes  with  more  abundant  actin  bundles,  clearly  showing 

signs  of  cellular  hypertrophy  development  caused  directly by  METH  (Maeno  et  al. 2000a). Also,  the  effects  of  METH on  ionic  currents  were  investigated  in  isolated  rat

ventricular  myocytes  using  the  whole-cell  patch  clamp technique.  Methamphetamine  had  inhibitory  effects  on transient  outward  potassium  current,  inward  rectifying potassium current,  and L-type  calcium currents  in ventricu­ lar  myocytes  (Liang  et  al. 2010). In  cultured  neonatal  rat cardiomyocytes,  incubation  with  0.5  mM  METH  changed beating  rate  and  altered  calcium  oscillation  pattern  via  the L-type  calcium  channels,  in  a  manner  independent  of  any neurotransmitter  (Sugimoto  et  al. 2009). These  alterations may  account  for  some  of  the  possible  electrophysiological mechanisms of cardiac damage caused by METH. There  is  sufficient  clinical  and  experimental  evidence  to suggest  that  METH  can  have  adverse  and  potentially  fatal effects on  the cardiovascular  system. The  existing literature suggests  that:  (1)  METH  users  are  at  elevated  risk  of  car­ diac  pathology;  (2)  risk  is  not  likely  to  be  limited  to  METH acute use, because the chronic METH use is also associated with  cardiomyopathy  (Hong  et  al. 1991; Ito  et  al. 2009; Yeo  et  al. 2007); (3)  the  risk  of  cardiac  pathology  is  higher among  chronic  METH  users;  (4)  pre-existing  cardiac pathology, due  to METH  use or  other factors,  increases the risk  of  an  acute  cardiac  event;  and  (5)  METH  use  is  likely to  exacerbate  the  risk  of  cardiac  pathology  from  other causes  and  may  therefore  lead  to  premature  mortality (Kaye et al. 2007). The  cellular,  animal,  and  human  autopsy  studies,  indi­ vidual  case  reports,  and  case  series  suggest  that  METH exposure  is  potentially  associated  with  structural  and  func­ tional  changes  of  myocytes,  as  well  as  clinical  manifesta­ tions of  cardiomyopathy  and congestive  heart failure,  which are  dependent on  METH ef fects towards  the ca techolaminergic system and also on METH direct cardiotoxicity.

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine cardiotoxicity

MDMA was  thought to  be safe  by recreational  users and  by psychotherapists  who  supported  its  use.  MDMA  was used  therapeutically  as  it  was  believed  to  increase  patient self-esteem  and  facilitate  therapeutic  communication.  The oral  administration  of  MDMA  (doses  ranging  between 75-175  mg)  produced  acute  sympathomimetic  effects,  such as  increased  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure  and  transient anxiety (Greer and  Strassman 1985; Grinspoon and Bakalar 1986; Lester et al. 2000; Mas et al. 1999). It  was  perhaps  the  article  by  Dowling  and  coworkers that  started  to  question  MDMA  safety  by  reporting  five deaths  associated  with  the  use  of  MDMA  and  MDEA (Dowling  et  al. 1987). It  was  concluded  that  MDMA  or MDEA  may  have  contributed  to  death  of  three  patients  by the  induction  of  arrhythmias  in  individuals  with  underlying natural  disease,  thus  highlighting  the  severity  of  their effects  in  the  heart  (Dowling  et  al. 1987). In  fact,  MDMA-

<£) Springer

related  fatal  complications  have  been  often  secondary  to cardiac  abnormalities,  massive  neurological  disturbances, and  multiple  organ  failure  (Connolly  and  O’Callaghan 

1999; Hall  and  Henry 2006; Henry 1992; Liechti  et  al. 2005; McCann et al. 1996). Hue and colleagues described 2 lethal  cases  associated  with  MDMA  use.  One  whole  tablet of ecstasy in one case and a half tablet of ecstasy  in another case led to  a lethal  outcome. Severe myocardial  contraction band necrosis was observed in these 2 cases as revealed by the  histopathology  examination.  Focal  interstitial  infiltra­ tion  of  lymphocytes  and  monocytes  around  myocardial lesions in  the first  case was  also found. T he results  suggest that  contraction  band  necrosis  can  be  induced  by  ecstasy and can  be potentially  lethal (Hua  et al. 2009). Other post­ mortem  studies  confirmed  these  effects.  In  fact,  a  39-yearold  woman  collapsed  after  oral  intake  of  MDMA.  After ingestion  of  the  drug,  she  felt  persistent  discomfort  in  her anterior chest area and lost consciousness for a few minutes on the  following morning.  She was  transported to  a hospital and died 7 days  after collapse. A serum  sample obtained on admission  revealed  a  MDMA  concentration  of  1.2  mg/L, but  no  evidence  of  any  other  drug  including  AMPH, METH,  or  other  ring-substituted  amphetamines,  thus excluding  the  presence  of  other  potentially  cardiotoxic amphetamines (Sano  et al. 2009). Microscopic examination at  autopsy  revealed  striking  changes  in  the  heart,  pre­ dominantly  in  the  right  ventricle,  including  small  foci  of myocyte  necrosis  with  a  surrounding  macrophage  inflam­ matory  response,  foci  of  fibrosis,  and  calcification  accom­ panied by  myocyte necrosis  (Sano et  al. 2009). These data in  humans  were  confirmed  in  animal  models.  In  rats, MDMA  is  well  known  to  produce  a  range  of  effects  on  the cardiovascular  function,  either  after  single  or  binge administration,  at  doses  ranging  from  10  to  30  mg/Kg. MDMA  promotes  an  enhancement  of  cutaneous  vasocon­

striction  both  in  rats  and  rabbits  (Blessing  and  Seaman 2003; Blessing  et  al. 2003; Fitzgerald  and  Reid 1994; Ootsuka et  al. 2004). In male  albino rats  administrated with 20  mg/kg  i.p.  MDMA,  myocardial  contraction  band necrosis  was  observed  after  6  h.  After  16  h,  monocytes around  the  necrotic  myocardial  cells  were  observed,  and within  24  h,  this  infiltrate  became  more  widespread wi th  an early  removal  of  the  necrotic  material.  Calcium  deposits were  observed  within  ventricular  cardiomyocytes  with intact nuclei and sarcomeres.

Single  administration  of  MDMA  can  significantly  pro­ duce  oxidative  stress,  which  may  result  in  lipid  peroxida­ tion  and  disruption  of  calcium h omeostasis (Cerretani  et al. 2008). The  depression  in  calcium  regulatory  mechanisms by  ROS  ultimately  results  in  intracellular  calcium  over­ load,  contraction  band  necrosis,  and  cell  death.  Also,  the calcium involvement can favor arrhythmias.

In  Sprague-Dawley  rats,  radiotelemetry  was  used  to characterize  the  cardiovascular  responses  elicited  during three  MDMA  binges  (9  mg/kg,  i.v.,  for  4  days),  each  binge separated by a 10-day MDMA-free period (Badon et al. 2002). The heart rate  and mean arterial  pressure responses elicited  by  9  mg/kg  doses  of  MDMA  were  consistent within and  between the  three binges  (Badon et  al. 2002). In the  first  binge,  the  9  mg/kg  doses  of  MDMA  increased mean a rterial  pressure  and  produced  a  biphasic  (decrease/ increase)  heart  rate  response.  After  repeated  dosing,  the pattern  of  mean  arterial  pressure  and  heart  rate  responses elicited  by  MDMA  changed  from  that  typically  elicited  by a  sympathomimetic  stimulant  to  one  resembling  vasovagal reflex  activation  (Badon  et  al. 2002). Over  the  course  of several  MDMA  binges,  there  is  an  increased  potential  for MDMA  to  generate  cardiac  arrhythmias.  In  fact,  in  this study,  MDMA  produced  cardiac  arrhythmias  in  some  rats. Finally,  the  binge  administration  of  MDMA  produced myocarditis.  The  hearts  of  MDMA-treated  rats  contained foci  of  inflammatory  infiltrates  (lymphocytes  and  macro­ phages),  some  of  which  contained  necrotic  cells  and/or disrupted  cytoarchitecture.  The  inflammatory  infiltrate  was predominantly  lymphocytic  with  low  content  of  mono­ cytes.  The  degree  of  cardiac  toxicity  observed  was  pro­ portional to  the number  of doses  administered (Badon  et al. 2002). These  results  indicate  that  binge  administration  of MDMA  can  significantly  alter  cardiovascular  and  cardio­ vascular  reflex  function  and  produce  cardiac  toxicity.  This study corroborates the  association between myocarditis  and MDMA  abuse  observed  in  post-mortem  studies  conducted in MDMA users (Hua et al. 2009; Milroy et al. 1996). It  was  shown  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats  that  the  effects  of MDMA  (9.19  mg/kg,  i.p.)  on  the  heart  rate  were  dependent on  the  environmental  temperature  at  which  animals  were kept during the drug administration. Rats kept  at an elevated ambient  temperature  (30  ±  1°C)  showed  higher  heart  rate than  animals  exposed  at  room  temperature  (21.5  ±  1.5°C) (Jaehne  et  al. 2008). Furthermore,  MDMA  can  produce  a dose-dependent  increase  in  mean  arterial  pressure  and  a range of other effects on  the rat cardiovascular function, due to  its  cardiac  stimulant  effects,  resulting  in  tachycardia  and arrhythmia  (Badon  et  al. 2002; Gordon  et  al. 1991; O’Cain et  al. 2000). Importantly,  in  rats,  MDMA and  MDA, its  main metabolite, produce a prolonged increase in both systolic and diastolic pressures, wi th MDA causing  the most marked  rise (Bexis and Docherty 2006). In humans, the cardiovascular effects were evaluated in a double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  in  eight  healthy  adults who  self-reported  MDMA  use.  At  a  dose  of  1.5  mg/kg MDMA,  increased  mean  heart  rate  (by  28  beats/min),  sys­ tolic blood pressure (by  25 mm Hg), diastolic b lood pressure (by  7  mm  Hg),  and  cardiac  output  (by  2  L/min)  were observed.  The  effects  of  MDMA  were  similar  to  those  of 

dobutamine at 20 and 40 mg/kg per minute (Lester et al. 2000) . However,  in  this  study, M DMA showed  no measur ­ able  inotropic  effects.  In  the  absence  of  inotropy  positive response,  incremental  increases  in  afterload  produce  pro­ portional increases in  force or tension  per unit of  cross-sec­ tional area of the ventricular  wall. This  increase in tension  is known  as  wall  stress  and  is  directly  related  to  myocardial oxygen  demand.  The  dose-related  increase  in  myocardial oxygen demand without an increase in  contractility may lead to  higher  risk  for  cardiovascular  complications  in  MDMA users  (Lester  et  al. 2000). A  randomized,  double-blind, crossover,  placebo-controlled  trial  was  conducted  in  nine healthy male subjects (Farre et al. 2004). MDMA at a dose of 

100 mg and the placebo were administered in two successive doses separated  by an interval of 24  h. The second  admin­ istration  of  MDMA  slightly  increased  heart  rate  in  compar­ ison  with  the  first  administration,  but  the  result  was  only 

significant  40  min  after  administration.  Diagnostic  criteria of isolated  systolic hypertension  (>140 mmHg)  were met  by 

six  subjects  following  the  first  dose  of  MDMA  and  eight 

subjects  following  the  second.  Hypertensive  episodes 

showed a  mean duration  of 1  h following  the first  dose and 

1.4  h  following  the  second  dose.  On  the  other  hand,  two 

subjects  met  diagnostic  criteria  of  sinus  tachycardia  (>100 beats/min),  both  following  the  second  dose  of  MDMA. Tachycardia lasted between 15 and 30 min (Farre et al. 2004). This work  clearly demonstrates  the hyperreactivity  of the noradrenergic system in  the cardiovascular system upon MDMA binge use.

MDMA, like  other amphetamines,  increases the  endoge­ nous  and  stimulated  release  of  peripheral  monoamines. MDMA  causes  the  efflux  of  5-HT  and  NA  and  to  a  lesser extent of DA  by an exchange  diffusion process involving  the respective transmitter transport carriers (Capela et al. 2009). As  stated,  the  acute  administration  of  MDMA  increases arterial pressure and heart rate in humans (Lester et al. 2000; Mas  et  al. 1999). In  rats,  the  pressor  responses  elicited by  MDMA  involve  the  activation  of  a-adrenergic  and 

serotonergic 5-HT2-type receptors (McDaid and Docherty 2001) .

MDMA  has  sympathomimetic  actions  in  peripheral organs as  demonstrated in  vitro (Fitzgerald  and Reid 1994) and in vivo (McDaid and Docherty 2001; O’Cain et al. 2000). Plasma  concentrations  of  5-HIAA,  5-HT,  NA,  adrenaline, and DA  were determined  in 159  ecstasy users  and controls 

(Stuerenburg et  al. 2002). “Ecstasy” users  showed elevated 

sympathetic  activity  at  rest,  reflected  in  increased  NA, adrenaline,  and  DA  levels  (Stuerenburg  et  al. 2002). Most 

surprising,  in  the  drug-free  interval,  MDMA  users  showed elevated  peripheral  noradrenergic,  dopaminergic,  and adrenergic  activities.  These  data  could  argue  for  a  norad­ renergic  hyperreactivity  in  the  drug-free  interval  in  ecstasy users  resulting  from  previous  “ecstasy”  consumption

(Stuerenburg  et  al. 2002). The  catecholamine  increase caused by  MDMA consumption  leads to  sustained stimula­ tion  of  adrenoceptors,  which  likely  causes  toxic  effects, namely  increased  blood  pressure,  tachycardia,  chest  pain, myocardial ischemia, and cardiac arrhythmia (Costa et al. 2011). In fact, ad renergic stimulation is  likely responsible for the  formation  of  intracellular  ROS  within  the  first  minutes. However, the  cells have  feedback mechanisms  that change the  adrenoceptors  responsiveness.  It  is  feasible  that  the oxidative  stress  induced  by  catecholamines  hours  after  the initial  exposure  is,  at  least  in  part,  due  to  the  oxidation  of those molecules (Costa et al. 2011). In vivo studies show that MDMA  administration  leads  to  oxidative  stress.  After administration  of  20  mg/kg  i.p.  of  MDMA  to  male  albino rats,  the  activity  of  antioxidant  enzymes  in  the  heart  was significantly  reduced  for  GPX  (by  24%)  and  SOD  (by  50%) 3  h  after  and  GR  (by  19%)  6  h  after  treatment  (Cerretani et  al. 2008). The  ascorbic  acid  levels  decreased  (by  37%) after  3  h  and  (by  30%)  after  6  h,  while  malondialdehyde level  increased ( by 119%)  after 3  h. GSH  levels decreased after  3  h  (by  31.3%)  and  6  h  (by  37.9%)  after  MDMA treatment (Cerretani et al. 2008). In animal  models, repeated  administration of  MDMA has resulted  in  myocarditis,  contraction  band  necrosis,  and fibrosis, most  likely as  a result  of the  noradrenergic proper­ ties of the drug (Badon et al. 2002; Cerretani et al. 2008; Sano et  al. 2009). Recently,  a  new  perspective  upon  MDMAinduced cardioto xicity advocates  that it  could be  caused (at least  in  part)  by  the  metabolites  of  MDMA.  Carvalho  and coworkers demonstrated  that incubation  of isolated  adult rat cardiomyocytes  with  metabolites  of  MDMA,  N-Me-aMeDA,  and  a-MeDA  resulted  in  loss  of  normal  cell  mor­ phology,  which  was  preceded  by  loss  of  GSH,  a  sustained increase of intracellular calcium levels, ATP  depletion, and a decrease  in  antioxidant  enzyme  activities  (Carvalho  et  al. 2004c). Also,  in  adult  rat  left  ventricular  myocytes  treated with  MDMA,  the  production  of  ROS  was  not  different  from control,  while  all  three  metabolites  of  MDMA  (a-MeDA, N-Me-a-MeDA,  and  2,5-bis(glutathione-S-yl)-a-MeDA) exhibited  time-  and  concentration-dependent  increases  in ROS that were prevented by the antioxidant NAC (Shenouda et al. 2009). Furthermore, the m etabolites of MDMA,  but not MDMA  alone,  significantly  decreased  contractility  and impaired  relaxation  in  myocytes  stimulated  at  1  Hz,  being these effects also prevented by NAC (Shenouda et al. 2009). These  in  vitro  studies  suggest  that  MDMA-induced  oxida­ tive stress in  the left ventricle  can be due,  at least in  part, to the  metabolism  of  MDMA  to  redox-active  metabolites. Thus,  MDMA-induced  oxidative  stress  plays  an  important role in  its cardiotoxic  actions, being  feasible that  the redox­ active  metabolites  of  MDMA  play  an  especially  important part  in  MDMA-induced  cardiac  toxicity  (Shenouda  et  al. 2010).

Springer

In  summary,  amphetamines  are  without  doubt  cardio­ toxicants,  as  reported  by  several  cellular  and  animal  stud­ ies, but  especially b y human  studies and  case reports.  The most  obvious  mechanism  to  their  cardiac  toxicity  is  their ability  to  activate  the  catecholaminergic  system  in  the  CNS and  in  the  peripheral  organs.  This  catecholaminergic  acti­ vation can cause direct  lesion on the heart or heart  coronary 

system.  In  fact,  several  studies  proved  that  also  the  direct action of  amphetamines and/or  their metabolites  can trigger cardiotoxicity  and  that  this  direct  cardiotoxic  potential cannot be neglected in future studies.

**Rhabdomyolysis and Kidney toxicity**

Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis  associated  with  the  use  of  AMPH  and  its methylenedioxy  derivatives  such  as  MDMA  is  commonly observed  in  young  people  after  strenuous  and  exhausting muscle  exercise  in  hot  environments  with  virtually  no ventilation  (characteristic  of  rave  parties)  (Greene  et  al. 2003; Halachanova et  al. 2001; Henry 1992; Ishigami et  al. 2003; Murthy  et  al. 1997; Richards  et  al. 1999; Screaton et  al. 1992; Williams  and  Unwin 1997). Individuals  with rhabdomyolysis  typically  have  violent  muscle  pain,  muscle weakness, and brown-colored urine.

Rhabdomyolysis  is  characterized  by  skeletal  muscle injury  with  release  of  myoglobin  and  other  intracellular proteins  and  electrolytes  into  the  circulation  (Bagley  et  al. 2007). There are  numerous factors  that can  cause rhabdo­ myolysis.  In  the  case  of  MDMA,  and  amphetamines  in general,  rhabdomyolysis  seems  to  be  caused  by  vigorous muscular  exercise,  hyperthermia,  cellular  hypermetabo­ lism,  reduced  muscle  perfusion,  coagulopathy,  and  sys­ temic  hypotension  (Kendrick  et  al. 1977; Terada  et  al. 

1988). Histopathological  analysis  of  muscle  specimens from  ecstasy  consumers  obtained  in  vivo  or  post-mortem revealed  edema  with  inflammatory  infiltrates,  fibers  in  a hypercontracted  state,  and  architectural  disarray  (Behan et  al. 2000; Fineschi  et  al. 1999). Rhabdomyolysis  often involves  the  myocardium  (Screaton  et  al. 1992). More recently,  Duarte  et  al. (2005) showed  enlargement  of  the interstitial space  and presence  of leukocyte  infiltrates in  the soleus  muscle  of  mice  administered  with  MDMA  and 

submitted to exercise for 24 h (Duarte et al. 2005).

Breakdown  of  muscle  cells  results  in  the  leakage  of myoglobin,  potassium,  phosphorus,  creatine,  muscle enzymes,  such  as  creatine  kinase  (CK)  and  alanine  trans­ aminase  (ALT),  and  ADP  (Bagley  et  al. 2007; Cunningham 

1997; Williams  and  Unwin 1997). The  release  of  K+  in heart  muscle  can  lead  to  arrhythmias  (Dhalla  et  al. 2001), and the release of CK, creatine, and probably ADP can

**Fig. 6** Schematic representation of the proposed mechanisms involved in rhabdomyolysis and kidney toxicity induced by amphetaminic compounds

cause  platelet  aggregation  (Kendrick  et  al. 1977). Also,  the release  of  antidiuretic  hormone  (ADH  or  vasopressin)  and catecholamines  induced  by  MDMA  may  originate  platelet aggregation  (Filep  and  Rosenkranz 1987). In  addition,  the increased  release  of  plasminogen  activator  from  muscle and  hyperthermia  may  cause  excessive  fibrinolysis 

(Chadwick  et  al. 1991; Terada  et  al. 1988). All  these  fac­ tors  ultimately  induce  a  state  of  DIC,  which  contributes  to nephrotoxicity  (Fig. 6). Kidney  damage  may  appear  fol­ lowing  microvascular  obstruction  as  a  result  of  fibrinplatelet  complexes  formed  inside  the  walls  of  blood vessels.  In  addition,  myoglobin,  which  is  filtered  by  the glomerulus,  when  in  excess  can  lead  to  tubular  obstruction and  degeneration.  Recent  studies  suggest  that  myoglobin can also  cause renal  damage via  oxidative stress  (Holt and Moore 2001; Ishigami et al. 2003).

Amphetamines nephrotoxicity

The  first  case  of  acute  renal  failure  associated  with AMPH  ingestion  was  reported  in  1970  by  Ginsberg  and coworkers  (Ginsberg  et  al. 1970). Kendrick  et  al. (1977) later  described  five  intravenous  consumers  of  METH  who developed  DIC,  rhabdomyolysis  with  myoglobinuria,  and renal  failure.  Several  cases  of  kidney  damage  secondary to  the  consumption  of  ecstasy  were  described  thereafter, including  acute  or  chronic  renal  failure  (Bingham  et  al. 

1998; Cunningham 1997; Fahal  et  al. 1992; Henry  et  al. 

1992; Walubo  and  Seger 1999; Woodrow  et  al. 1995), necrotizing  renal  vasculopathy  (Bingham  et  al. 1998), and acute transient proximal tubular injury (Kwon et al.

2003). Histopathological  analysis  performed  in  kidney 

biopsies  from  patients  intoxicated  with  amphetamines 

(Bingham  et  al. 1998; Foley  et  al. 1984; Woodrow  et  al. 

1995) and  in  fatal  cases  (Ago  et  al. 2006; Chadwick 

et  al. 1991; Dar  and  McBrien 1996; Fineschi  et  al. 

1999; Fineschi  and  Masti 1996; Ishigami  et  al. 2003) 

showed  extensive  tubular  degeneration  and  necrosis, 

interstitial  edema  and  hemorrhage,  small  vessel  occlu­

sion,  infiltration  of  leukocytes  in  the  renal  medulla,  and 

the  presence  of  tubular  casts  showing  anti-myoglobin 

immunostaining.

Mechanisms of amphetamines nephrotoxicity

Although  there  is  undeniable  evidence  of  the  nephrotoxic 

effects  of  amphetamines,  the  mechanism  responsible 

remains  to  be  clarified.  However,  DIC  and  rhabdomyolysis 

are  frequent  clinical  complications  in  amphetamines  con­

sumers, which can cause obstruction of the micro vasculature 

and tubular degeneration  as a result of  deposition of platelet 

aggregates  or  myoglobin,  respectively  (Cunningham 1997; 

Fahal et al. 1992; Fineschi and Masti 1996). This process can 

lead to sudden renal ischemia and eventually to acute tubular 

necrosis.

In  addition,  amphetamines  have  vasoconstrictive  prop­

erties  that  predispose  the  renal  medulla  to  ischemia  and 

hypoxia.  Finally,  a  possible  direct  toxic  effect  of  the  drug 

and/or  its  metabolites  in the  kidney was  proposed by  Foley 

and  coworkers  (1984)  after  observing  a  clinical  case  of 

acute interstitial  nephritis in  the absence  of muscle  damage 

and hyperpyrexia (Foley et al. 1984).

Hyperthermia

An  overwhelming  similarity  observed  in  most  cases  of amphetamine-induced  renal  failure  is  the  onset  of  hyper­ thermia. It  has been  shown that  heat injury  from any  source can  cause  rhabdomyolysis,  coagulopathy,  and  multiple organ  failure  (Dar  and  McBrien 1996). Therefore,  it  would seem reasonable to postulate  that the hyperthermia induced by  amphetamines  is  responsible  for  the  ensuing  renal damage  especially  when  one  observes  the  striking  resem­ blance  in  the  etiology  of  these  cases  to  that  of  heatstroke (Chao  et  al. 1981; Lumlertgul  et  al. 1992). Importantly,  as previously  mentioned,  most  cases  involve  young  people who,  after  taking  the  drug,  danced  for  hours  in  hot  envi­ ronments. Thus,  the intense  and exhausting  muscular effort required  in  this  type  of  parties  associated  with  the  high temperatures  reached  in  the  body  are  predisposing  factors to the development of muscle and kidney damage.

Thioether toxicity

To  our  knowledge,  neither  AMPH  nor  METH  have  been proven  to  be  directly  nephrotoxic.  Regarding  MDMA,  our group  previously  showed  that  neither  MDMA  nor  MDA  are directly  toxic  to  either  primary  cultured  rat  or  human proximal  tubular  epithelial  cells  (Carvalho  et  al. 2002b). In contrast,  a-MeDA  and  the  corresponding  monoconjugate and  biconjugate  with  GSH  showed  to  be  potent  nephrotoxicants,  thus  indicating  that  metabolism  is  a  prerequisite for  the  renal  toxicity  of  MDMA.  In  addition,  we  showed  the ability  of  acivicin,  an  inhibitor  of  -/-glutamyl  transpeptidase (y-GT),  and  bestatin,  an  inhibitor  of  aminopeptidase  M, to  potentiate  the  nephrotoxicity  of  5-(glutathione-S-yl)a-MeDA.  These  findings  suggest  that  degradation  of  this conjugate  by  y-GT  and  aminopeptidase  M  constitutes  a detoxication  mechanism.  To  explain  this  effect,  it  was hypothesized  that  y-GT-mediated  hydrolysis  of  5-(glutathione-S-yl)-a-MeDA  and  subsequent  aminopeptidase M-mediated  glycine  cleavage  may  lead  to  oxidative  cycli­ zation  of  the  cysteine  conjugate.  In  this  reaction,  the  cys­ teinyl  amino  group  condenses  with  the  quinone  carbonyl  to give  a  benzothiazolyl-like  compound.  Since  this  reaction eliminates  the  reactive  quinone  function  from  the m olecule, it  effectively  prevents  redox  cycling  of  the  thioether.  The intramolecular  cyclization  reaction  can  therefore  be  con­ sidered  an  intramolecular  detoxication  reaction.  In  addition, quinone  thioethers  are  known  to  inhibit  a  variety  of enzymes  that  utilize  GSH  as  either  a  substrate  or  a  co­ substrate,  including  y-GT  (Monks  and  Lau 1998). Such  an effect  of  the  a-MeDA-GSH  conjugate  on  y-GT  at  PTC membranes  may  subsequently  also  increase  extracellular concentrations  of  nephrotoxic  metabolites  of  MDMA.  Since these  conjugates  retain  the  ability  to  redox  cycle,  with  the 

<£) Springer

concomitant  generation  of  ROS,  it  is  possible  that  they induce  lipid  peroxidation  of  cell  membranes.  In  addition, GSH-linked  o-quinones  interact  with  thiol  groups  of extracellular  functional  proteins,  which  play  a  critical  role in  cell  function.  Thus,  it  seems  that  toxicity  induced  by thioether  metabolites  of  MDMA  at  the  apical  membrane  of renal  proximal  tubular  cells  is  the  result  of  extracellular events, presumably redox cycling.

In  summary,  it  appears  that  conditions  of  enhanced oxidative  stress  in  kidneys,  in  addition  to  hyperthermia, contribute  to  mechanisms  of  amphetamines-mediated nephrotoxicity.  The  risk  of  impaired  renal  performance increases  if  the  developing  hyperthermia  is  further  aggra­ vated  by  predisposing  conditions  such  as  high  ambient temperatures,  crowding,  loud  noise,  alcohol/multi-drug use,  inefficient  fluid  replacement,  and  elevated  activity levels. However,  one should  always keep  in mind  that other factors  such  as  genetic  susceptibility  and  impurities  in  the 

street drugs may play a role in the observed toxicity.

**Pharmacogenetics**

The influence of genetic polymorphism on the metabolism and toxicity of amphetamines

Individual  susceptibility  to  the  adverse  effects  of  any xenobiotic  can  be  determined  by  the  combination  of  (1) 

stable  heritable  traits  occurring  in  the  human  genome,  (2) non-genetic  variables,  and  (3)  gene-environment  interac­ tions.  Therefore,  genetic  variation  in  genes  coding  the proteins  involved  in  the  drug  kinetics  and/or  dynamics  can be  determinant  for  toxicity.  Mutations  in  the  genetic  code may  be  responsible  for  differences  in  the  subjective  effects of  drugs  of  abuse  making  them  either  more  rewarding  or aversive  depending  on  the  genotype  (Haile  et  al. 2009). 

Some  of  these  genetic  polymorphisms  affecting  proteins that  potentially  contribute  for  amphetamines  toxicity  are discussed below.

Genetic polymorphism of metabolic enzymes

Several  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of  ampheta­ mines  are  functionally  polymorphic,  and  their  altered expression  may  therefore  influence  the  pharmacokinetics of these drugs and in consequence their toxicity.

### CYP2D6

CYP2D6  is  the  major  enzyme  involved  in  the  oxidative metabolism  of  MDMA  that  in  turn  produces  metabolites  of recognized  toxicity.  Therefore,  it  was  hypothesized  that individuals  carrying  deficient  alleles  for  the  enzyme  might

be  at  a  higher  risk  for  the  occurrence  of  acute  toxic  effects 

(including  hyperthermia  and  cardiovascular  effects) resulting  from  a  direct  action  of  the  drug  (Greene  et  al. 2003; Segura  et  al. 2005). On  the  other  hand,  individuals carrying  multiple  copies  of  the  CYP2D6  gene  could  be predisposed  toward  neurotoxicity  due  to  the  expected increased  production  of  potentially  neurotoxic  metabolites 

(Segura et al. 2005).

The  variation  in  MDMA  metabolism  and  the  consequent formation of the reactive catechol metabolites due to C YP2D6 deficiency  were  already  evaluated  in  vitro  (Ramamoorthy et al. 2002; Tucker et al. 1994) and in vivo  in humans (de  la Torre et al. 2005). One of these studies evaluated the metab­ olism of the drug in microsomes expressing the allele variants CYP2D6*2,  *10  and  *17  (Ramamoorthy  et  al. 2002). The CYP2D6*2  variant  is  associated  with  the  intermediate metabolizer phenotype in Caucasians (Raimundo et al. 2000). The  allele  CYP2D6*10,  highly  prevalent  in  oriental  popula­ tions,  originates  a  deficiency  in  the  tertiary  and  quaternary 

structure  of  the  protein  strongly  impairing  the  expression  of the functional enzyme (Johansson et al. 1994). The carriers of allele  CYP2D6*17,  highly  prevalent  in  African  populations, also  exhibit  diminished  metabolic  capacity  (Masimirembwa et al. 1996). The microsomal preparations expressing variant CYP2D6*10  presented  the  lowest  metabolic  capacity  for MDMA,  followed  by  CYP2D6*2  and  CYP2D6*17  (Rama­ moorthy et al. 2002). The same authors had previously con­ ducted a  study comparing  the catalytic  activity of  the variant enzyme  CYP2D6*10  with  wild-type  CYP2D6*1  in  MDMA demethylenation  and  found  that  this  metabolic  reaction occurred to a much lesser extent with CYP2D6* 10 than with CYP2D6*1  (Ramamoorthy  et  al. 2001). In  this  study,  the authors  also  showed  that  both  variants  were  inhibited by MDMA  and that  the Ki was  significantly higher f or variant CYP2D6*10 probably due to the lower affinity  of the mutated enzyme toward MDMA (Ramamoorthy et al. 2001).

An  in  vitro  study  attempting  to  elucidate  the  influence  of polymorphic  expression  of  CYP2D6  on  MDMA  cytotox­ icity  used  genetically  modified  V79  cells  expressing  the human  wild-type  CYP2D6*1,  the  low-activity  alleles CYP2D6*2,  *9,  *10,  and  *17,  and  human  CYP3A4 

(Carmo  et  al. 2006). The  results  showed  that  the  cytotoxic effects  of  MDMA  were  clearly  increased  in  cells  express­ ing  CYP2D6*1  compared  with  the  control  cells  devoid  of CYP-dependent  enzymatic  activity.  Toxicity  in  V79 CYP2D6*1  cells  was  also  higher  than  in  V79  cell  lines expressing  the  low-activity  alleles  CYP2D6*2,  *9,  *10,  or 

*17,  whereas  the  CYP3A4  isoenzyme  did  not  change MDMA  toxicity.  The  formation  of  the  N-Me-a-MeDA oxidative  metabolite  was  greatly  enhanced  in  the  V79  cell line  transfected  with  wild-type  CYP2D6*1  compared  to  all other  cell  lines.  The  increase  in  the  cytotoxic  effects  of MDMA  observed  in  this  cell  line  was  therefore  suspected 

to  be  a  consequence  of  the  increased  production  of  this 

reactive  metabolite.  The  results  confirmed  this  hypothesis 

as  the  metabolite  proved  to  be  more  than  100-fold  more 

toxic  than  the  parent  compound  under  the  same  experi­

mental  conditions  (Carmo  et  al. 2006). In  view  of  these 

data,  it  was  speculated  that  CYP2D6  ultra-rapid  metabo-

lizers  might  be  predisposed  for  MDMA  intoxications  due 

to  the  potential  increase  in  toxic  metabolite  production 

(Carmo  et  al. 2006). In  contrast,  the  susceptibility  to  the 

toxic  effects  of  the  drug  that  positively  correlate  with 

plasma  concentrations  would  be  expected  to  be  lower  in 

these individuals.

This  study  model  was  further  used  to  elucidate  the 

influence  of  polymorphic  CYP2D6  expression  on  the 

cytotoxicity  of  another  amphetamine  derivative,  4-meth-

ylthioamphetamine  (4-MTA,  also  known  as  the  street  drug 

flatliners)  (Carmo  et  al. 2007). As  with  MDMA,  the 

expression  of  wild-type  CYP2D6*1  clearly  enhanced  the 

susceptibility  to  the  cytotoxic  effects  of  4-MTA  compared 

with  the p arental  cells d evoid o f C YP-dependent  enzymatic 

activity  and  the  V79  cell  lines  expressing  the  low-activity 

alleles (Carmo et al. 2007).

The  changes  in  MDMA  pharmacokinetics  associated 

with  CYP2D6  deficiency  were  evaluated  in  vivo  during 

a  clinical  study  conducted  with  10  healthy  volunteers 

administrated  with  MDMA  under  controlled  experimental 

settings  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2005). One  of  these  individuals 

was  homozygous  for  allele  CYP2D6*4,  which  is  associated 

with  diminished  enzyme  activity,  and  3  were  heterozygous 

for  alleles  CYP2D6*l/4.  The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 

MDMA  and  metabolites  varied  significantly  according  to 

the  different  CYP2D6  genotypes  (Table 4) (de  la  Torre 

et  al. 2005). It  was  observed  that  MDMA  plasma  concen­

trations  were  significantly  higher  in  the  individual  with  the 

poor  metabolizer  genotype,  while  the  metabolite  produc­

tion  was  significantly  lower.  Also,  for  the  extensive 

metabolizers,  the  time  for  maximal  plasma  concentration 

of  the  N-Me-a-MeDA  metabolite  was  shorter,  indicating 

that  first-pass  metabolism  was  likely  impaired  in  the  poor 

metabolizer.  Heterozygous  CYP2D6*l/*4  subjects  pre­

sented  intermediate  pharmacokinetic  parameters  with  sta­

tistically  significant  differences  toward  the  extensive 

metabolizers and the poor metabolizer (de la Torre et al.

2005). Another interesting  observation in  this study  was the 

higher  increase  in  body  temperature  and  the  absence  of 

MDMA-induced  prolactin  release  in  the  poor  metabolizer 

relative  to  the  other  9  individuals.  The  authors  suggested 

that  these  effects  could  be  related  with  the  phenotype, 

anticipating  a  higher  risk  for  hyperthermia  for  the  poor 

metabolizers  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2005). The  observed 

pharmacokinetic  differences  could  only  be  noted  during  the 

first  24  h  after  the  first  MDMA  administration.  After  the 

second  dose,  and  most  likely  as  a  result  of  CYP2D6

inhibition,  differences  among  phenotypes  were  abolished (de la Torre et al. 2005). In  another  study  with  the  MDMA  analogue  MDEA,  a lower  production  of  the  corresponding  catechol  metabolite after  demethylenation  of  the  drug  was  observed  in  an individual  homozygous  for  allele  CYP2D6*4  (Kreth  et  al. 2000). These  data  showing  the  influence  of  the  different CYP2D6  genotypes  on  MDMA  pharmacokinetics  promp­ ted  the  studies  for  the  evaluation  of  the  potential  associa­ tion  between  poor  metabolizer  phenotype  and  the occurrence of acute intoxication in recreational users. The  genotyping  of  3  patients  presenting  severe  MDMAinduced  hepatotoxicity  revealed  that  all  were  extensive metabolizers  (Schwab  et  al. 1999). Similarly,  two  other studies  in  which  individuals  intoxicated  with  MDMA  were genotyped  also  showed  that  the  oxidative  metabolism reduction  was  not  associated  with  increased  susceptibility to  intoxication  (Gilhooly  and  Daly 2002; O’Donohoe  et  al. 1998). Taken  together,  these  data  corroborate  the  specu­ lation  that  phenotypes  associated  with  higher  metabolic capacity  may  predispose  toward  toxicity  rather  than  be protective. A  recent  study  investigated  the  association  of  CYP2D6, COMT,  and  SERT  genotypes  with  changes  in  cortisol plasma  concentration  following  MDMA  consumption  in  48 subjects at a  recreational setting (Wol ff et al. 2011). Plasma cortisol  concentrations  increased  after  MDMA  ingestion, and  an  association  between  CYP2D6  genotype  and increase in cortisol levels was reported (Wolff et al. 2011).

Catechol-o-methyltransferase

In  Caucasians,  the  frequencies  for  the  phenotypes  with distinct  degrees  of  COMT  enzymatic  activity  are  25%  for the  high-activity  phenotype,  50%  for  the  intermediate­ activity  phenotype,  and  25%  for  the  reduced-activity  phe­ notype (Weinshilboum  et al. 1999). These phenotypes  have been  attributed  to  a  single-nucleotide  polymorphism  that changes  amino  acid  valine  with  methionine  at  position  108 in  soluble  COMT  and  position  158  in  membrane-bound COMT  (Lachman  et  al. 1996; Lotta  et  al. 1995; Lundstrom et al. 1995). The  study  of  the  influence  of  the  vall58met  polymor­ phism  on  AMPH  effects  showed  that  individuals  carrying the met/met genotype  (homozygous for  the mutation)  seem to  be  at  an  increased  risk  for  AMPH-induced  adverse reactions  (Mattay  et  al. 2003). Another  study  conducted with  METH-dependent  users  found  an  association  between this polymorphism and METH dependence (Li et al. 2004). In  the  study  conducted  by  Wolff  and  collaborators  that evaluated  the  association  of  CYP2D6,  COMT,  and  SERT genotypes  with  changes  in  plasma  cortisol  concentration 

<£) Springer

following  MDMA  consumption,  a  positive  association between  the  low-activity  COMT  genotype  (met/met)  and MDMA-induced  change  in  cortisol  levels  was  found 

(Wolff et al. 2011).

Genetic polymorphism of pharmacological and toxicological drug targets

Proteins  involved  in  the  biological  and  toxicological actions  of  amphetamines  can  also  be  functionally  poly­ morphic  and,  as  such,  associated  with  the  marked  interin­ dividual  variability  in  susceptibility  toward  the  adverse effects elicited by these drugs of abuse.

These  proteins  include  receptors,  transporters,  ion channels,  lipoproteins,  clotting  factors,  proteins  involved  in cell  cycle  control,  in  immune  function,  and  in  cellular development (Meisel et al. 2003).

Dopamine receptor

The  polymorphism  of  D2  dopamine  receptor  was  associ­ ated  with  increased  vulnerability  to  psychostimulant  abuse 

(Persico et al. 1996).

In  a  study  attempting  to  associate  the  polymorphism  of D4  dopamine  receptors  with  METH  abuse,  an  association between  a  haplotype  in  the  promoter  region  of  the  gene coding  for  this  receptor  and  a  risk  for  METH  dependence was  found  (Li  et  al. 2004). Another  interesting  result  from this  study  that  simultaneously  analyzed  the  vall58met COMT  polymorphism  was  the  finding  of  a  significant interaction  between  this  polymorphism  and  the  polymor­ phism of  D4 dopamine  receptors, thus  indicating a  possible additive  effect  of  both  polymorphisms  in  risk  for  depen­ dence  of  this  drug  of  abuse  (Li  et  al. 2004). Conflicting results were  more recently  reported in  a study  performed in patients  with  METH  dependence  and/or  psychosis  in  a Japanese  population  (Ujike  et  al. 2009). In  this  later  study, no  significant  association  between  polymorphism  of  DA receptors  D2,  D3,  or  D4  with  METH  dependence  was observed.  However,  the  data  suggested  that  genetic  vari­ ants  of  DA  receptor  D2,  but  not  D3  or  D4,  increased individual  risk  for  the  rapid  onset,  prolonged  duration,  and 

spontaneous  relapse  of  METH-induced  psychosis  (Ujike et al. 2009).

Serotonin transporter

The  serotonin  transporter  is  one  of  the  initial  targets  of  the amphetamines  toxicological  response.  In  humans,  tran­

scriptional  activity  of  SERT  gene  (SLC6A4)  is  modulated by  a  polymorphic  repetitive  element  (5HTT  gene-linked polymorphic  region,  5HTTLPR)  located  upstream  of  the transcription  start  site.  Other  sites  for  genetic  variability

have  been  described,  but  this  polymorphism  seems  to  be the  most  important  for  SERT  variability  (Lesch  and Gutknecht 2005). The  majority  of  alleles  are  composed  of either  14-  or  16-repeat  units  (short  and  long  allele, respectively),  while  alleles  with  15-,  18-  to  20-,  or 22-repeat  copies,  and  variants  with  single-base  insertions/ deletions  or  substitutions  within  individual  repeats  are  rare. Allele  and  genotype  distributions  may  vary  considerably among differe nt populations.  The studies  that characterized the  influence  of  this  polymorphism  on  the  5-HT  uptake revealed  that  homozygous  expression  of  the  short  allele  is associated  with  a  reduction  in  SERT  expression  and  con­ sequently  with  a  lower  5-HT  uptake  ability  (Lesch  and Gutknecht 2005). A  study  that  evaluated  the  effects  of  the  polymorphic expression  of  this  transporter  on  the  vulnerability  toward the  negative  effects  of  MDMA  on  cognition  associated with  serotonergic  function  impairment  indicated  a  likely association  between  this  genetic  variation  and  cognitive deficits induced by MDMA consumption (Roiser et al. 2006). A  similar  study  conducted  by  the  same  research group  had  previously  demonstrated  that  MDMA  abusers homozygous  for  the  SERT-mutated  allele  showed  altera­ tions  in  emotional  processing  in  neuropsychological  tests (Roiser  et  al. 2005). In  contrast,  individuals  homozygous for  this  allele  that  did  not  consume  MDMA  did  not  show this  disturbance.  Based  upon  this  data,  the  authors  con­ sidered  that  there  is  a  higher  risk  for  the  development  of emotional  dysfunctions  in  MDMA  abusers  who  are  carriers of  the  mutated  allele,  since  these  are  more  susceptible  to the  MDMA  adverse  effects  on  the  serotonergic  system (Roiser et al. 2005). SERT genotype also seemed to influence the response to amphetamines effects as evaluated by a series of behavioral tests  after  controlled  d-AMPH  administration  (Lott  et  al. 2006). A  recent  study  provided  evidence  for  the  possible association between  the SERT  polymorphic expression  and a  greater  risk  for  earlier  onset  METH  use  among  METHdependent Caucasian men (Johnson et al. 2010). A possible role  for  this  polymorphism  on  METH-induced  psychosis was  also  suggested  in  a  study  conducted  with  Japanese METH  abusers  (Ezaki  et  al. 2008). However,  a  previous study with  a population  of Chinese  METH abusers  failed to find such an association (Chen et al. 2007).

Other targets of amphetamines toxicological actions

The  oxidative  stress  induced  by  METH  in  the  brain  has been  implicated  in  its  neurotoxic  effects.  The  influence  of the  polymorphism  of  glutathione  S-transferase  Ml (GSTM1)  on  METH  abuse  was  investigated  since  this enzyme  is  crucial  for  the  detoxification  of  ROS.  A  possible 

association  between  GSTM1  polymorphism  and  increased vulnerability  to  METH-induced  psychosis  was  revealed  in a Japanese population (Hashimoto et al. 2005).

The  dopamine  transporter  (DAT)  is  also  an  important 

site  for  amphetamines  action.  A  study  on  the  effect  of DAT1  polymorphism  (coded  by  the  SLC6A3  gene) revealed  that  the  different  genotypes  were  associated  with different  susceptibility  to  the  subjective  effects  of  d-AMPH administrated  under  the  controlled  experimental  settings  of a  clinical  study.  This  study  showed  that  there  is  a  possible influence  of  genetic  variability  of  this  transporter  in  sus­ ceptibility  toward  the  psychostimulant  effects  and  conse­ quently  on  the  risk  for  dependence  of  these  type  of  drugs 

(Lott  et  al. 2005). A  more  recent  study  also  evidenced increased  sensitivity  to  the  subjective  effects  of  d-AMPH in  individuals  carrying  the  mutated  genotype  (Hamidovic et al. 2010). These genotypes were also  associated with the risk  for  psychosis  development  in  a  population  of  METH abusers (Ujike et al. 2003).

The  polymorphic  expression  of  other  proteins  influenc­ ing response  and/or dependence  for amphetamines  include the  brain-derived  neurotrophic  factor  (Flanagin  et  al. 2006; 

Sim  et  al. 2010), the  opioid  polypeptide  prodynorphin 

(Nomura  et  al. 2006), the  adenosine  A2A  receptor  that modulates  the  effects  of  dopaminergic  receptors  (Hohoff et  al. 2005; Kobayashi  et  al. 2010), the  GABA(A)  receptor y2  subunit  (Nishiyama  et  al. 2005), the  norepinephrine transporter  (Dlugos  et  al. 2009), and  the  /i-opioid  receptor 

(Ide et al. 2006).

**Factors affecting the stimulant/toxic effects** **of amphetamines**

The  type  and/or  severity  of  stimulant/toxic  effects  medi­ ated  by  amphetamines  are  extremely  unpredictable  since they  are  determined  by  the  conjunction  of  several  factors including  the  dose  and  route  of  administration,  the  envi­ ronmental  conditions  where  amphetamines  are  consumed, the  genetic,  physiologic,  and  pathophysiologic  character­ istics  of  the  consumer,  and  the  co-exposure  to  other  sub­

stances that can interact with these drugs. These factors can cause  changes  in  the  formation  of  active  and/or  toxic metabolites  and,  potentially,  cause  serious  and  even  fatal intoxications.

Dose

The  dose  of  amphetamines  consumed  will  determine  not only  their  addictive  potential  (Ellinwood  and  Kilbey 1980) but  also  the  intensity  and  the  persistence  of  their  bio­ logic  and  toxic  effects,  mainly  due  to  the  metabolic

auto-inhibition  induced  by  these  molecules  (Kraemer  and Maurer 2002). As  with  every  illicit  drug,  both  the  dose  and the  purity  of  the  amphetamines  pills  change  substantially. This  fact  was  observed  in  several  studies  concerning  the analysis  of  the  composition  of  ecstasy  pills  that  showed variable doses  of MDMA,  but also  other inert  substances or psychoactive  drugs  (Baggott  et  al. 2000; EACD  Expert Advisory  Committee  on  Drugs 2004; Schifano  et  al. 1998; 

Spruit 2001; Tanner-Smith 2006) that  can  cause  unex­ pected  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  and/or  pharmacodynamic 

(PD)  interactions  with  unpredictable  pathophysiological outcomes.  In  addition,  tolerance  is  developed  rapidly  in amphetamines  abuse  (Leith  and  Barrett 1981). Therefore, periods  of  extended  use  require  increasing  amounts  of  the drug  in  order  to  achieve  the  same  effect,  which  may potentiate the development of adverse effects.

Route of administration

There is  some epidemiologic  evidence reporting  a relation­

ship  between  the  route  of  administration  and  the  adverse effects of amphetamines (dependence symptoms, treatment­

seeking,  adverse  psychological  symptoms,  and  violence), independently of other  risk factors, such as  dosage and fre­ quency of  use. A  higher prevalence  of psychological  symp­ toms, such  as depression,  anxiety, paranoia,  hallucinations, and violence, was already related to the use of amphetamines by injection (Hall and Hando 1994).

Intravenous  injection  is  the  fastest  route  of  drug administration,  causing  blood  concentrations  to  rise  the most  quickly,  followed  by  smoking,  suppository  (anal  or vaginal  insertion),  insufflation  (snorting),  and  ingestion 

(swallowing).  Ingestion  does  not  produce  a  rush  which  is most  pronounced  with  the  i.v.  administration.  On  the  other hand,  intranasal  administration  of  amphetamines  results  in a  more  rapid  onset  compared  to  oral  dosing,  which  could be  associated  with  the  popularity  of  intranasal  stimulant use and an enhanced potential for abuse (Lile et al. 2011).

Environmental conditions

The  health-threatening  risk  associated  with  the  consump­ tion  of  psychoactive  substances  is  also  related  to  the environmental  conditions  surrounding  the  consumer  (Bellis et  al. 2002). In  fact,  the  toxicity  of  amphetamines  was 

shown  to  be  potentiated  under  conditions  of  high  envi­ ronmental  temperature  (Miller  and  O’Callaghan 2003; Peterson  and  Hardinge 1967), repetitive  high-volume  noise 

(Gesi  et  al. 2002,  2004), stressful  environments  (Johnson et  al. 2004), overcrowded  places  (aggregation  effect) 

(Davis  et  al. 1974; Meyer  et  al. 2002b), intense  physical activity  (Parrott 2004,  2006), and  inappropriately  adjusted fluid intake (Cole and Sumnall 2003; Dafters 1995).

Springer

The  environmental  temperature  can  affect  both  the 

thermogenic  effects  of  these  compounds  (Miller  and 

O’Callaghan 2003; Peterson  and  Hardinge 1967), as  well 

as  their  toxicokinetic  profile  by  affecting  their  distribution 

volume  (Banks  et  al. 2007) and  their  addictive  potential 

(Banks et al. 2008).

Noise  can  increase  the  neurotoxicity  of  these  com­

pounds  by  increasing  damage  to  dopaminergic  terminals 

(Gesi et al. 2004) and can increase the  risk of sudden death 

following  rhabdomyolysis  in  the  myocardium  (Gesi  et  al. 

2002).

Both  stressful  and  overcrowded  environments  increase 

the acute  effects of  amphetamines as well  as their addictive 

potential (Johnson et al. 2004; Meyer et al. 2002b).

Intense  physical  activity  increases  the  toxicity  of 

amphetamines  (Parrott 2004) probably  due  to  an  increase 

in  heat  production,  which  contributes  to  the  hyperthermic 

response.

Fluid  intake  can  influence  the  toxicity  of  these  com­

pounds. While  the absence  of water  consumption increases 

significantly  the  hyperthermic  response  (Dafters 1995), 

the  exaggerated  consumption  of  water  can  contribute  to 

hyponatremia  and  consequent  cerebral  edema  (Cole  and 

Sumnall 2003).

Characteristics of the consumer

There are  several consumer-inherent  factors that  can affect 

the risk  associated with the  consumption of  amphetamines, 

since  these  factors  determine  his/her  metabolic  capacity, 

his/her  susceptibility  to  develop  acute  effects,  and al so can 

influence  the  acquired  consumption  patterns.  The  main 

characteristics  of  the  consumer  which  may  influence  the 

effects  caused  by  amphetamines  are  as  follows:  age,  eth­

nicity,  gender,  interindividual  pharmacogenetic  variations, 

sexual  orientation,  and  physiologic  and  physiopathologic 

states.

Age

The  consumption  of  amphetamines  is  mainly  associated 

with  younger  age  groups  (United  Nations  Office  on  Drugs 

and Crime 2011). It is  important to  note that  age can  affect 

the  expression  of  enzymes  involved  in  the  metabolism  of 

these  substances  (Parkinson  et  al. 2004; Sotaniemi  et  al. 

1997). Due  to  a  higher  metabolic  rate  of  the  enzymes 

involved  in  the  metabolism  of  amphetamines  (Parkinson 

et al. 2004), adolescents seem to have reduced sensitivity to 

the  psychotropic  effects  of  drugs  like  cocaine,  ketamine, 

and  MDMA,  which  can  lead  to  a  higher  consumption  per 

episode  when  compared  with  older  individuals  (Wiley  et  al. 

2008). However,  the  latter,  due  to  tolerance  phenomena, 

are usually  exposed to  higher drug  amounts per  episode as

well  as  more  amounts  of  other  drugs  to  modulate  the obtained  effects  (Scholey  et  al. 2004), therefore  increasing the risk of interactions.

Ethnicity

Besides  the  influence  of  age,  the  consumption  patterns  of amphetamines  are  also  influenced  by  ethnicity  (Ompad et  al. 2005). Genetic  variation,  as  previously  described, dietary,  and  lifestyle  factors  vary  among  different  ethnic groups  and  may  significantly  modify  the  toxicological response to amphetamines.

Gender

Regarding  the  gender,  women  are  more  susceptible  than men  to  the  psychoactive  effects  and  neurotoxicity  of MDMA  (Liechti  et  al. 2001;  Parkinson  et  al. 2004), prob­ ably  due  to  a  lower  metabolic  capacity.  However,  men seem to be more prone to  the hyperthermic effect and to the general  toxicity  of  amphetamines  (Miller  and  O’Callaghan 2003; Wyeth  et  al. 2009) probably  due  to  their  higher metabolic  rate  and  consumption  patterns  (EMCDDA European  Monitoring  Centre  for  Drugs  and  Drug  Addiction 2010), leading to higher formation of toxic metabolites.

Sexual orientation

The  sexual  orientation  may  affect  the  amount  consumed and  the  frequency  of  consumption  (Degenhardt 2005), conditioning  the  final  outcome  after  consumption  of amphetamines.  In  fact,  lesbian/bisexual  women  usually consume  larger  amounts  of  drugs,  namely  MDMA, cocaine,  METH,  and  LSD  (Parsons  et  al. 2006), than  het­ erosexual  women.  However,  the  frequency  of  consumption seems  the  same  in  both  groups  (Degenhardt 2005). With respect  to  men,  the  frequency  of  consumption  of  ecstasy has  been  shown  to  be  higher  in  homosexual/bisexual  than in heterosexual.

Physiologic and physiopathologic states

Besides  the  modulation  of  amphetamines  response  by  the innate  characteristics  of  the  consumer,  the  acute  and  toxic effects caused  by amphetamines  can also  be influenced  by physiologic  and  physiopathologic  states  that  can  change the  PK  and  PD  of  these  drugs.  We  should  highlight  the influence of: •  Pregnancy—The  use  of  psychoactive  drugs  by  pregnant women  has  the  potential  to  affect  fetal  development (McElhattan  et  al. 1999; Salisbury  et  al. 2009) and  to increase the risk of hypertension-related complications.

Additionally,  the  mother  can  experience  an  increase  in amphetamines  neurotoxicity,  due  to  the  increase  in CYP450  metabolism  (Wadelius  et  al. 1997) and decrease  in  plasma  protein  binding  (Notarianni 1990) that occurs during this period. •  Hypo/hyperthyroidism—Thyroid  hormones  (which  are increased  after  amphetamines  consumption  (Mills  et  al. 2004)) are  thermomodulators,  and  hyperthyroidism increases  the  hyperthermic  effects  of  MDMA,  while hypothyroidism does the reverse (Sprague et al. 2007). •  Kidney  and  liver  failure—These  pathologies  imply  a reduction  in  renal,  hepatic,  and  intestinal  clearance, modification  of  the  distribution  volume  of  the  com­ pounds, decrease in plasma protein binding, and decrease in  tissue  binding,  altering  the  systemic  bioavailability and increasing  the risk  for adverse  reactions (Dreisbach and Lertora 2003; Kahraman et al. 2006), mainly of drugs with high first-passage metabolism. •  Inflammatory  and  infectious  diseases—It  is  well  estab­ lished  that  inflammatory  processes  (Renton 2001) affect  the  metabolism,  distribution,  and  elimination  of certain  drugs  (Renton 2004). These  effects  result  from the  down-regulation  of  CYP450  and  drug  transporter proteins  during  the  generation  of  host  defense  mech­ anisms.  In  clinical  medicine,  there  are  numerous examples  indicating  that  a  decrease  in  the  capacity  to handle drugs occurs during infections and disease states that  involve  an  inflammatory  component  and  that  this decrease  leads  to  the  subsequent  development  of  drug toxicity (Morgan 1997; Renton 2005). •  Cardiorespiratory  disease—Amphetamines  consumers who  suffer  from  cardiorespiratory  diseases  will  be  less tolerant  to  amphetamines  toxicity.  In  fact,  fatal  out­ comes  after  amphetamines  consumption  seem  to  be more  common  in  individuals  with  underlying  cardiac disease (Chadwick et al. 1991; Dowling et al. 1987). •  Diabetes  mellitus  as  well  as  obesity  can  alter  the expression  of  metabolizing  enzymes  due  to  hormonal changes  (e.g.,  insulin,  glucagon,  growth  hormone,  etc.) 

(Corcoran  and  Wong 1987; Kim  and  Novak 2007). The metabolic alterations can affect both the acute effects and the toxic  profile of  the amphetamines  and can  be further aggravated by the increase in oxidative stress phenomena that usually occur during these pathological states. •  Increase  in  corticosterone  levels—The  increase  in corticosterone  levels  induced  by  amphetamines  con­

sumption  (Nash  et  al. 1988), prolonged  stress  (Vallee et  al. 1996), or  chronic  exposure  to  supraphysiological levels  of  corticosterone  seems  to  increase  the  neuro­ toxicity  of  amphetamines,  probably  due  to  an  increase in  the  vulnerability  of  the  striatum,  but  not  the hippocampus  to  S-(+)-MDMA  neurotoxicity  (Johnson et al. 2002a).

Co-exposure with other substances

Poly-consumption  patterns  can  increase  the  health  risks  of amphetamines  due  to  the  unpredictable  chemical  and  idi­ osyncratic  reactions  that  can  result  from  the  mixture  of xenobiotics  in  the  body,  potentially  leading  to  PK  and/or PD interactions. Since, in humans,  amphetamines are mainly  metabolized by  the  enzymatic  complex  CYP450,  their  effects  can  be influenced  by  PK/PD  interactions  with  other  compounds (pharmaceuticals, drugs  of abuse,  nutrients, etc.)  that share or affect the same metabolic pathway (Oesterheld et al. 2004). For  example,  CYP2D6  inhibitors  including  the  pro­ tease  inhibitor  ritonavir,  some  selective  serotonin  re-uptake inhibitors,  quinidine,  imipramine,  and  thioridazine,  may prolong  amphetamine  toxicity  by  reducing  hepatic  metabo­ lism  (de  la  Torre  et  al. 2004b). This  postulate  may  also  be applied  to  the  potentiation,  by  amphetamines,  of  the  dele­ terious  effects  mediated  by  drugs  with  narrow  therapeutic windows  that  are  CYP450  substrates  (e.g.,  some  trycyclic antidepressants,  antiarrythmic,  /(-blockers,  antipsychotics, tramadol), since  the metabolic  auto-inhibition caused  by the amphetamines  can  disproportionally  increase  the  levels  of the co-administered drug, leading to intoxication. Being  sympathomimetic,  pro-serotonergic,  and  prodopaminergic  drugs,  amphetamines  can  potentially  estab­ lish  PD/toxicodynamic  interactions  with  compounds  that share  the  same  mechanism  of  action  or  an  antagonistic one  (Oesterheld  et  al. 2004). In  fact,  the  effects  of  the amphetamines  might  be  potentiated  by  cocaine,  anticho­ linergics,  tricyclic  antidepressants,  theophylline,  selective serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRi),  monoamine  oxidase inhibitors  (MAOi),  caffeine,  salicylates,  and  LSD  (Greene et al. 2008). Some compounds can combine the two above-mentioned characteristics  and  simultaneously  be  pro-serotonergic/adrenergic/-dopaminergic,  and  CYP450  inhibitors,  poten­ tially  causing  unpredictable  PK  and  PD  interactions  with amphetamines  (Oesterheld  et  al. 2004). For  example, fluoxetine,  paroxetine,  and  cocaine  are  both  selective inhibitors  of  5-HT  reuptake  and  potent  CYP450  2D6 inhibitors,  increasing  both  the  concentration  of  MDMA  (PK interaction)  and  the  serotonergic  activity  (PD  interaction) (Ramamoorthy et al. 2002). The co-exposure to amphetamines  and other compounds may  be  related  not  only  with  the  common  poly-consumption  of  other  licit  and  illicit  substances  along  with amphetamines,  but  also  with  the  exposure  to  psychoactive substances  inadvertently  ingested  as  contaminants  of amphetamine  pills  (Baggott  et  al. 2000) as  wells  as  with the  consumption  of  pharmaceuticals  (as  part  of  medical treatments  or  to  intentionally  modulate  the  effects  of amphetamines).

Pills contaminants

Club  drug  pills  are  very  heterogeneous  and  variable  in terms  of  their  ingredients  (Cole  and S umnall 2003). In  fact, they can contain  only inert substances  (sodium bicarbonate, talc,  sugars),  different  percentages  of  amphetamines,  a totally  different  drug  than  the  one  that  the  consumer 

intends  to  buy,  or  the  desired  drugs  might  be  mixed  with 

other  contaminants  (Giroud  et  al. 1997). For  example, METH  is  often  mixed  or  “cut”  with  other  substances, 

including  caffeine  or  talc,  to  add  bulk,  improving  profit 

margin (Greene et al. 2008). Due to these contaminants, the toxic  effects  of  the  amphetamines  may  only  be  part  of  the potentially  lethal  effects  that  may  arise  from  the  con­

sumption  of  these  pills.  Some  of  the  contaminants  may  be 

safe,  but  others  might  cause  devastating,  acute,  or  long­ term  effects.  Other  problem  with  the  decrease  in  the  purity 

of  amphetamines  pills  is  that  while  the  amphetamines 

content decreases, the user  tends to increase the  number of pills  consumed  to  obtain  the  desired  effects  (Schifano 

2004), which  increases  the  risk  of  toxic  effects  caused  by the  contaminants  in t he p ills, o r  of  an o verdose  if a  sample 

with higher purity is taken in sequence.

Among  the  contaminants  in  amphetamines  pills,  we may  expect  to  find:  by-products  of  chemical  synthesis, 

amphetamines  mixtures,  ketamine,  ephedrine  and 

derivatives,  caffeine,  LSD,  dextromethorphan,  and  inert 

excipients.  Although  we  may  think  that  the  inert 

excipients  present  in  amphetamines  pills  cannot  affect their  effects,  the  fact  is  that  the  inclusion  of  sodium bicarbonate  in  these  pills  is  made  with  the  intention  of prolonging  their  effects  through  the  alkalinization  of  the 

excretion  fluids,  which  will  delay  the  elimination  of  the 

amphetamines.

By-products of chemical synthesis

Although  there  is  no  analytical  evidence  showing  the presence  of  by-products  of  chemical  synthesis  in  all  the batches of  amphetamines pills,  their eventual  presence is  of high  concern,  since  some  of  these  compounds,  namely MDA,  saphrol  and  analogues,  tetrahydrofuran,  methanol, 

and  N-methylformamide,  among  others  (Shulgin 1986), may  interact  with  MDMA  effects,  and,  more  importantly, they  may  also  have  intrinsic  serious  toxic  profiles  that  can 

increase  the  risk  of  a  health-threatening  outcome  after 

amphetamines pills consumption.

Amphetamines mixtures

Amphetamines  pills  rarely  contain  only  one  type  of  these 

stimulants and  are most  often constituted  by amphetamines mixtures.  In  fact,  it  is  usual  to  find  MDMA  in  association

with  MDA,  MDEA,  METH,  or  others.  Because  they  share metabolic  pathways  and  mechanisms  of  action,  the  inter­ action  potential  is  very  high,  and  they  can  cause  additive reactions, increasing the  deleterious effects exerted  by each individual  compound.  For  example,  the  co-consumption  of MDA,  AMPH,  MDMA,  and  PMA  was  already  associated with  lethal  intoxications  (Dams  et  al. 2003), and  the  same was  also  observed  with  simultaneous  exposure  to  MDEA and  MDMA  (Fineschi  and  Masti 1996). It  was  also  dem­ onstrated  that  the  combination  of  MDMA  with  METH causes synergistic euphoric and  pro-social effects (Clemens et  al. 2007) and  stronger  toxic  reactions  than  each  one  of the  drugs,  separately  (Clemens  et  al. 2004). In  addition,  all the  phenylisopropylaminic  amphetamines  are  CYP  inhibi­ tors,  which  will  increase  the  plasma  levels  of  ampheta­ mines, and  therefore increase  the risk  of acute  toxicity. It  is also  important  to  stress  that  if  the  relative  proportion  of pro-dopaminergic  amphetamines  in  the  pills  is  higher,  the addictive  potential  of  these  pills  will  be  increased  (GarciaRates et al. 2007).

Caffeine

Exposure  to  caffeine  occurs  not  only  with  the  contami­ nation  of  pills  but  also  with  the  consumption  of  coffee, cola  sodas,  or  energetic  drinks  that  are  often  consumed to  decrease  tiredness  and  sleepiness.  This  xanthine,  when co-consumed  with  MDMA,  increases  the  MDMAinduced  DA  release  (Vanattou-Saifoudine  et  al. 2011), potentiates  its  serotonergic  neurotoxicity,  increases the  intensity  and  duration  of  the  MDMA-related  hyper­ thermic  response  (Vanattou-Saifoudine  et  al. 2010a; Vanattou-Saifoudine  et  al. 2010b), induces  a  persistent profound  tachycardia,  not  seen  when  both  compounds  are consumed  separately,  and  increases  the  weight  loss caused  by  neurotoxic  doses  of  MDMA,  probably  due  to 

synergistic  anorectic  effects  (Camarasa  et  al. 2006; McNamara  et  al. 2006). It  was  also  already  shown  that caffeine  induces  convulsive  states  when  administered with  MDA  and  also  increases  the  intensity  and  duration of  the  MDA-related  hyperthermic  response  and  decreases the  brain  levels  of  5-HT  and  its  metabolites  (McNamara et  al. 2006). Caffeine  seems  also  to  affect  the  PK  of  the amphetamines  by  increasing  their  intestinal  absorption 

(Kuwayama  et  al. 2007). Probably  due  to  a  confluence  of the  above-mentioned  phenomena,  caffeine  was  already proved  to  increase  mortality  after  acute  co-administration of  AMPH,  MDMA,  and  MDA  (Derlet  et  al. 1992). Therefore,  while  caffeine  is  considered  safe  and  freely accessible  in  drinks  like  tea,  coffee,  and  non-alcoholic beverages,  its  ingestion  with  amphetamines  can  exacer­ bate  their  toxicity,  increasing  the  health  risk  associated with the consumption of these drugs.

Dextromethorphan

The  presence  of  the  antitussive  dextromethorphan  is  very 

common  in  stimulant  pills,  and,  due  to  its  mechanism  of 

action, dextromethorphan can potentiate the pro-serotonergic 

effects of the amphetamines (Kamei et al. 1992). In addition, 

since both compounds are metabolized through the CYP450 

system,  they  may  compete  for  the  metabolic  pathways, 

increasing the incidence and severity of the adverse effects of 

both substances. However, until now, there was no report on 

intoxications of this nature (de la Torre et al. 2004a).

Intentional poly-consumption of recreational drugs

Intentional  poly-consumption  of  recreational  drugs  is  the 

most  frequent  behavior  pattern  of  amphetamines  consum­

ers,  with  high  prevalence  of  co-consumption  of  other 

psychoactive  substances  especially  tobacco,  cannabis,  and 

alcohol,  and  also  other  amphetamines,  cocaine,  LSD,  ket­

amine,  GHB,  psilocybin/psilocin,  and  heroin.  It  was 

already described that  the intensity and  the pattern of  use of 

amphetamines  will  alter  the  propensity  of  the  individuals 

for  drug  poly-consumption  (Scholey  et  al. 2004). These 

other substances  might be  consumed before, d uring, or in  a 

short  period  after  exposure  to  amphetamines  (EACD 

Expert  Advisory  Committee  on  Drugs 2004). The  need  of 

drug  poly-consumption  may  arise  as  a  consequence  of  PD 

tolerance  appearing  after  regular  consumption  of  amphet­

amines,  in  an  attempt  to  obtaining  pleasant  experiences 

(Parrott 2001), but  also  of  decreasing  the  withdrawal 

symptoms.  In  fact,  ethanol,  benzodiazepines  (Copeland 

et  al. 2006), cannabis  (Sala  and  Braida 2005), sildenafil 

(Breslau 2002), anti-histaminics  (Winstock  et  al. 2001), 

and  5-hydroxitryptophane  (Copeland  et  al. 2006) are  usu­

ally  taken  to  decrease  the  undesired  effects  of  ampheta­

mines.  Therefore,  this  poly-consumption  hampers  the 

assessment  of  the  long-term  effects  of  amphetamines  by 

masking  them  with  the  effects  of  the  co-consumed  psy­

choactive drugs (Cole and Sumnall 2003).

In  addition,  the  simultaneous  use  of  multiple  psycho­

stimulant  drugs  increases  not  only  the  risk  of  problems 

related  with  sympathomimetic  over-stimulation  [e.g., 

dehydration,  hyperthermia  (Williams  et  al. 1998), and 

cardiovascular  problems  (Milroy  et  al. 1996)] but  also  the 

chances  to  develop  neurotoxicity  (Winstock  et  al. 2001). 

For  example,  the  poly-consumption  patterns  that  include 

MDMA  were  already  associated  with  impairments  in  set 

shifting  and  memory  updating  and  also  in  social  and 

emotional  judgement  processes  (Reay  et  al. 2006). Also  a 

case of amnesic syndrome and severe ataxia was described 

following  the  co-consumption  of  MDMA,  together  with 

amyl  nitrate,  lysergic  acid  (LSD),  cannabis,  and  ethanol 

(Kopelman et al. 2001).

Cannabis

The  majority  of  the  amphetamines  consumers  also  con­

sume  cannabis  (Parrott  et  al. 2007). The  consumers  of amphetamines  use  the  relaxing  properties  of  cannabis  and its derivatives  to reduce  the typical  symptoms of  anhedonia and  depression  that  appear  in  the  days  subsequent  to amphetamines  consumption  (Parrott  and  Lasky 1998). However,  cannabis  contributes  to  psychological  problems, cognitive  deficiencies,  and  other  neurobiological  problems 

(sleep  disorders,  sexual  dysfunction,  reduced  immuno­ competence,  endocrine  disorders,  and  oxidative  stress) 

(Parrott 2006) in  MDMA  users,  which  can  be  cumulative  at the  long  term,  especially  impulsivity,  anxiety,  obsessivecompulsive  patterns,  psychotic  behaviors,  as  well  as  neurocognitive  deficits  (memory,  learning,  word  fluency,  and 

speed of  processing) (Dafters  et al. 2004). In fact, wh en the main  active  metabolite  of  cannabis,  A9-tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  is  administered  simultaneously  with  MDMA, there  is  a  synergistic  disruption  of  memory  in  rats  (Young et  al. 2005), and  a  low  dose  of  THC  can  modulate  the 

sensitivity  of  animals  to  the  behavioral  effects  of  MDMA 

(Robledo  et  al. 2007). This  interaction  can  be  due,  at  least in  part,  to  the  fact  that  THC  and  MDMA  converge  at  a common  mechanism  modulating  dopamine  outflow  in  the nucleus  accumbens  of  mice  (Robledo  et  al. 2007). Fur­ thermore,  the  co-exposure  to  amphetamines  and  cannabis, especially  at  the  long  term,  cause  changes  in  the  immu­ nological  homeostasis,  with  a  decrease  in  the  total  number of  lymphocytes,  that  may  result  in  the  increased  suscepti­ bility  to  infections  and  in  immunological  diseases  (Pacifici et  al. 2007). The  combined  intake  of  MDMA  and  THC  also affects  ongoing  electroencephalogram  oscillations  differ­ ently  than  the  sum  of  either  one  drug  alone.  Concretely, combined  intake  of  MDMA  and  THC  affects  theta  and lower-1  alpha  power  less  than  the  sum  of  the  single-drug effects,  but  exacerbates  the  reductions  in  lower-2  alpha power,  which  may  be  related  to  the  impaired  task  perfor­ mance  that  has  often  been  reported  after  drug  intake 

(Lansbergen  et  al. 2011). On  the  other h and,  cannabinoids can prevent  the acute  hyperthermia and  decrease the  5-HT depleting  effects  of  MDMA,  and,  therefore,  partially  pro­ tect  against  MDMA  neurotoxicity  in  rats  (Morley  et  al. 2004). We  can  also  expect  to  have  some  PK  interaction between  amphetamines  and  cannabis  since  THC  and  its derivatives  are  metabolized  through  the  CYP450  complex 

(Matsunaga et al. 2000).

Cocaine

Cocaine is often used to potentiate the psychostimulant effects of  amphetamines  by  increasing  the  synaptic  levels  of  DA, 5-HT, and NA,  although it also  increases their dopaminergic 

Springer

neurotoxicity (Daza-Losada et al. 2008). Cocaine effects may 

be  also  modulated  by  amphetamines.  The  repeated  pre­

exposure  of  rats  to  MDMA  increased  the  locomotor  activity 

and the  addictive effects  induced by  cocaine (Fletcher  et al. 

2001). Another PD interaction of cocaine and amphetamines 

may arise from the fact that both drugs induce hyperthermia in 

an  extent  dependent  on  the  environmental  temperature 

(Gonzalez 1993). In  addition,  cocaine  is  also  a  CYP2D6 

inhibitor,  reducing  the  metabolism  of  amphetamines  and 

increasing their blood levels (Shen et al. 2007).

Ketamine and ephedrine

Ketamine  and  ephedrine,  like  amphetamines,  also  have 

thermogenic,  sympathomimetic,  and  pro-dopaminergic 

effects  that  may  cause  PD  interactions  with  amphetamines 

and  increase  their  addictive  potential  (Soni  et  al. 2004; 

Wolff  and  Winstock 2006). Besides  the  possible  PD 

interactions,  ketamine  and  ephedrine  may  also  affect  the 

PK  of  amphetamines  by  competing  for  the  same  metabolic 

pathways  (Hijazi  and  Boulieu 2002; Soni  et  al. 2004), but 

also  by  decreasing  the  intestinal  absorption  of  ampheta­

mines (Kuwayama et al. 2007).

Furthermore,  ketamine  can  affect  the  toxicity  of 

amphetamines  by  causing  amnesia  that  may  increase  the 

number  of  pills  consumed  per  episode,  increasing  the 

probability  for  overdose  and  intoxication.  The  risk  of  car­

diac  over-stimulation  is  one  of  the  potentially  lethal  con­

sequences  of  combining  ketamine  with  amphetamines  (Gill 

and Stajic 2000).

### LSD

The  co-consumption  of  LSD  (a  strong  hallucinogenic)  and 

amphetamines  (known  as  candyflipping  or  XL)  is 

increasing,  and  it  results  in  a  synergistic  pro-serotonergic 

interaction  that  may  also  increase  their  toxic  response 

(Schechter 1998). Although  PK  interactions  with  amphet­

amines  were  not  yet  reported,  an  important  role  for 

CYP450  2D6  (CYP2D6)  in  the  metabolism  of  LSD  has 

been  revealed  by  some  studies  (Yu 2008), suggesting  that 

the  co-consumption  of  amphetamines  and  LSD  could  act 

additively  at  the  kinetic  and  dynamic  levels,  leading  to 

severe or even fatal serotonin toxicity.

### GHB

The  co-consumption  of  amphetamines  and  y-hydroxybu-

tyric  acid  (GHB,  liquid  ecstasy)  can  result  in  different 

kinds  of  PD  interactions.  This  co-consumption  attenuates 

the dysforic un pleasant effects  of amphetamines (due  to the 

GHB  effects  at  the  central  dopaminergic  system)  (Uys  and 

Niesink 2005) and  causes  long-lasting  neuroadaptations  in

brain  oxytocin  system  that  may  be  related  to  the  long-term social  interaction  deficiencies  caused  by  both  drugs  (van Nieuwenhuijzen  et  al. 2010). On  the  other  hand,  GHB reduced  the  hyperthermia  and  hyperactivity  produced  by co-administered  doses  of  MDMA  or  METH  at  28°C  (van Nieuwenhuijzen and McGregor 2009). The  establishment  of  PK  interactions  between  GHB  and amphetamines  seems  improbable since  these drugs  do not share metabolic pathways.

Psilocybin/psilocin

The  consumption  of  “Magic”  mushrooms  containing  psi­ locybin/psilocin  along  with  amphetamines  has  a  great potential  for  the  establishment  of  PD  interactions,  since psilocybin/psilocin  have  sympathomimetic  pro-serotoner­ gic and pro-dopaminergic effects (Passie et al. 2002).

Tobacco

Tobacco  is  extensively  consumed  among  amphetamines users,  and  it  has  a  strong  potential  to  establish  PK  inter­ actions  with  these  drugs,  since  some  of  its  constituents (nicotine,  polycyclic  aromatic  hydrocarbons,  and  other combustion  products)  are  potent  CYP450  and  UGT inducers  (Benowitz 2008). Furthermore,  the  activation  of nicotinic  receptors  by  tobacco  nicotine  will  release  DA, NA,  acetylcholine,  5-HT,  GABA,  glutamate,  and  endor­ phins  (Benowitz 2008), which  may  cause  PD  interactions with amphetamines.

Ethanol

Ethanol is one  of the substances  more frequently consumed with  amphetamines.  Combined  use  of  MDMA  and  alcohol causes  dissociation  between  subjective  and  objective sedation, which makes  subjects feel euphoric,  less sedated, and  having  the  feeling  of  doing  better,  but  actual  perfor­ mance  ability  continues  to  be  impaired  by  the  effect  of alcohol  (Hernandez-Lopez  et  al. 2002). MDMA  moderated the  impairing  effects  of  a  low  dose  of  alcohol  on  road­ tracking  performance,  but  it  could  not  overcome  alcoholinduced  impairment  on  other  aspects  of  driving  behavior  or driving-related  performance  (Kuypers  et  al. 2006). Ethanol seems  also  to  increase  the  risk  of  appearance  of  psychopathological  disorders  associated  to  MDMA  consumption, since  those  who  consumed  alcohol  together  with  MDMA had  a  risk  2.5  times  higher,  with  respect  to  alcohol abstainers,  of  eventual  development  of  psychopathological disturbances  (Schifano  et  al. 1998). A  collateral  risk associated  with  the  co-consumption  of  amphetamines  and ethanol is the spread of sexually transmitted diseases due to an increase of sexual risk behaviors (Breen et al. 2006).

When co-consumed  with amphetamines,  ethanol can  cause important  PD  interactions  and  slight  PK  interactions  (de  la Torre  et  al. 2004a). Ethanol  can  establish  PD  interactions with  amphetamines  that  may  be  antagonistic  (due  to  its pro-GABAergic  activity)  as  well  as  additive  or  synergistic effects  (pro-serotonergic  and  pro-dopaminergic  stimula­ tions;  muscle  damage  and  neuroendocrine,  cardiovascular, hepatotoxic,  nephrotoxic,  and  teratogenic  effects).  The most  relevant  PD  interactions  between  ethanol  and amphetamines  are  the  thermoregulatory  changes  and  the psychomotor  and  immunological  effects.  In  fact,  ethanol co-administered  with  MDMA  at  normal  ambient  tempera­ ture  increases  dramatically  the  MDMA-induced  hyperlocomotion  and  decreases  the  MDMA-induced  hyperthermic response  (Hamida  et  al. 2008). The  extent  of  this  effect  is increased  with  subsequent  administrations  of  ethanol  and depends  on  MDMA  dose  (Hamida  et  al. 2008) and  on ambient  temperature  (Cassel  et  al. 2007), since  prevention of  MDMA-induced  hyperthermia  by  ethanol  was  not observed  when b oth compounds  were administered at  high environment  temperature  (32°C).  These  psychomotor  and thermoregulatory  effects  are  thought  to  be  caused  by  the potentiation  caused  by  ethanol  on  the  MDMA-induced 5-HT  and  DA  release  at  the  striatum  (Riegert  et  al. 2008). Furthermore,  as  it  was  already  described  for  cannabis,  the combination  of  MDMA  and  ethanol  causes  a  transient defect  in  immunological  homeostasis  characterized  by  a higher  suppressive  effect  on  CD4  T  cells  and  increasing effect  in  NK  cells  than  any  of  the  drugs  alone  and  a deregulation  in  the  production  of  pro-  and  anti-inflamma­ tory  cytokines  with  an  unbalance  toward  anti-inflammatory response  that  might  alter  the  immune  response  with  a  risk for  the  general  health  status  (Pacifici  et  al. 2001). In addition,  the  co-exposure  to  ethanol  and  MDMA  enhanced MDMA-mediated  long-term  neurotoxicity  in  rats  (Izco et  al. 2007) as  well  as  its  hepatotoxicity  in vivo  and  in vitro on  primary  cultured  rat  hepatocytes  (Pontes  et  al. 2008a). The  PK  interactions  may  arise  from  the  different  dose­ dependent  effects  of  ethanol  on  several  CYP450  isoen­ zymes  (Busby  et  al. 1999). In  fact,  ethanol  increases MDMA  levels  in  the  striatum  and  prevents  the  MDMAinduced  DA  depletion  and  inhibition  of  tyrosine  hydroxy­ lase  in  mice  (Johnson  et  al. 2004). The  increase  in  MDMA levels  in  the  presence  of  ethanol  was  also  observed  in humans  (Hernandez-Lopez  et  al. 2002; Ramaekers  and Kuypers 2006), which  indicates  the  possibility  of  a  PK interaction between  these substances.  However, the  effects of  ethanol  on  MDMA  metabolism  are  controversial, because in some studies, ethanol decreased the metabolism of  MDMA  to  MDA  (Ben  Hamida  et  al. 2007), in  others, ethanol  exposure  increased  the  metabolism  of  MDMA  to HMA  and  MDA  in  a  temperature-dependent  fashion,  in  a pathway mediated, at least partially, by CYP3A and

CYP2E1  (Pontes  et  al. 2010). Probably  due  to  the  meta­ bolic  interaction  between  these  two  compounds,  some amphetamines  users  refer  that  ethanol  blocks  or  counter­ acts  the  pleasant  effects  of  MDMA  and  increases  its  col­ lateral effects and vomiting (Solowij et al. 1992).

Heroin

Other drugs  such as  heroin seem  also to  increase the  tox­ icity  of  amphetamines,  although  the  underlying  mechanism is not elucidated yet (Gerevich 2005).

Amphetamines mixtures

Finally,  synergic  toxic  effects  may  appear,  and  the  longlasting  deleterious  effects  may  be  prolonged  when co-consuming  different  amphetamines  that  will  increase neurotoxicity,  probably  by  an  increase  in  oxidative aggression  (Gouzoulis-Mayfrank  and  Daumann 2006). The simultaneous  consumption  of  MDMA  and  METH  seems  to be  particularly  dangerous  (Clemens  et  al. 2007). However, MDMA  seems  to  reduce  the  positive  reinforcement  effects of  METH  (Clemens  et  al. 2006). Fatal  intoxications  asso­ ciated  with  simultaneous  consumption  of  MDMA,  AMPH, MDA,  and  PMA  were  already  described,  being  character­ ized  by  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  induced  by hyperthermia  (Dams  et  al. 2003). And,  obviously,  PK interactions  are  also  expected  due  to  the  common  meta­ bolic  pathways  of  these  compounds.  In  fact,  pre-exposure to  MDA  inhibits  MDMA  metabolism,  increasing  the  brain levels of the latter (Hashimoto et al. 1993).

Intentional poly-consumption of medications

Some  medications  and  food  supplements  are  intentionally used  after  amphetamines  consumption  to  modulate  their unpleasant  effects  (Copeland  et  al. 2006). The  most  com­ mon  medications  intentionally  consumed  with  ampheta­ mines  are  benzodiazepines  and  sildenafil,  followed  by antidepressants.  The  nutritional  supplement  most  com­ monly  consumed  is  5-hydroxytryptophane  (Copeland  et  al. 2006).

Antidepressants

Antidepressants,  like  amphetamines,  increase  the  amount of neurotransmitters  in the  synaptic cleft,  and they  are used by  ecstasy  consumers  to  prevent  eventual  neurotoxic effects,  to  avoid  the  negative  effects  associated  with  the abstinence  of  this  drug,  to  increase  the  intensity  of  its effects,  to  prolong  the  duration  of  the  effects,  or  to  facili­ tate  sleep  (Copeland  et  al. 2006). Some  amphetamines, such  as  PMA,  do  not  require  an  antidepressant  for  these 

Springer

purposes because they are themselves MAOi (Freezer et al. 2005) . The  most  commonly  used  antidepressants  are  the 

SSRi  (e.g.,  citalopram,  fluoxetine,  paroxetine,  sertraline), the  MAOi  (e.g.,  phenelzine,  moclobemide),  and  the  nor­ adrenaline reuptake inhibitors (e.g., desipramine).

Although  some  antidepressant  medications  may  block the  subjective  and  some  cardiovascular  effects  of  amphet­ amines,  they  do  not  prevent  the  hyperthermic  response 

(Liechti  et  al. 2000a; Stanley  et  al. 2007; Tancer  and Johanson 2007) and can  increase the  risk of  the onset  of a 

serotonergic  syndrome.  In  fact,  SSRi  decrease  MDMAinduced  5-HT  release,  attenuate  its  behavioral  effects  in animals  (Meehan  et  al. 2002), and  reduce  the  subjective and  cardiovascular  response  in  humans  (Liechti  et  al. 2000a; Tancer  and  Johanson 2007). However,  the  blood pressure  response  to  MDMA  is  only  partly  attenuated  by blockade  of  5-HT  release  with  citalopram  (Liechti  and Vollenweider 2000). The  NAT  inhibitor  desipramine  and the  SERT  inhibitor  citalopram,  but  not  the  DAT/NAT inhibitor  methylphenidate,  reverse  the  acute  cognitive effects  of  MDMA  in  rhesus  monkeys  (Verrico  et  al. 2008). However,  the  DAT/NAT  inhibitor  bupropion  was  shown  to attenuate subjective responses to METH (Newton et al. 2006)  . Overall,  the  NAT  inhibitors  (e.g.,  nisoxetine,  atomoxetine,  reboxetine)  cause  a  pronounced  decrease  in  the cardiovascular  stimulant  effects  of  amphetamines  (Hysek et  al. 2011; Quinn  et  al. 2006; Sofuoglu  et  al. 2009) and  a moderate  attenuation  of  their  psychostimulant  properties 

(Hysek  et  al. 2011; Sofuoglu  et  al. 2009), despite inhibiting their metabolism (Hysek et al. 2011).

Despite  some  MAOi  being  used  by  amphetamines  con­

sumers to  “increase the  peak”, frequent  fatal outcomes  due to  the  potentiation  of  the  pro-serotonergic  effects  of  this association  have  been  reported  (Pilgrim  et  al. 2010,  2011, 2012; Vuori  et  al. 2003), mainly r elated to  the co nsumption of  amphetamines  along  with  MAO-A  inhibitors  (e.g.,  moc­ lobemide,  clorgyline).  Contrary  to  what  is  observed  with MAO-A  inhibitors,  the  selective  MAO-B  inhibitors  (e.g., 

selegiline,  L-deprenyl)  seem  to  confer  some  protection against  MDMA  neurotoxicity  by  decreasing  the  depletion  of 5-HT in the  brain, the formation  of reactive species  resulting from  MAO-B  action  on  the  released  catecholamines,  and therefore the  lipid peroxidation  and the  oxidative damage  to the  mitochondria  (Alves  et  al. 2007,  2009; Sprague  and Nichols 1995).

Furthermore,  some  antidepressants  (e.g.,  fluoxetine, paroxetine)  can  inhibit  CYP450  causing  simultaneously  PD 

(through  their  pro-serotonergic  action)  and  PK  (through  the increase  of  MDMA  plasma  levels  due  to  the  inhibition  of its  metabolism)  interactions  (Ramamoorthy  et  al. 2002). Therefore,  these  compounds  may  decrease  the  neurotox­ icity  of  MDMA  metabolites  (Sanchez  et  al. 2001), but  they cannot  prevent  the  acute  effects  of  the  amphetamines

because  their  levels  will  be  higher  for  longer  periods (Upreti and Eddington 2008).

Benzodiazepines

Benzodiazepines,  by  facilitating  GABA  receptor-mediated CNS  inhibition,  are  indirect  antagonists  of  amphetamines sympathomimetic  effects  (Derlet  et  al. 1990; Nisijima  et  al. 2003), and  therefore  are  the  first-line  agents  to  control these  symptoms  of  amphetamines  intoxications  at  emer­ gency  departments.  However,  it  should  be  highlighted  that the  AMPH-induced  hyperactivity  is  potentiated  by  the benzodiazepine  chlordiazepoxide,  resulting  in  heightened levels  of  hyperactivity  relative  to  levels  triggered  by  either compound  alone.  This  interaction  effects  of  the  AMPHchlordiazepoxide  combination  are  not  explained  by  a  PK interaction  as  both  drugs  have  similar  brain  and  plasma exposures, either  administered alone  or in  combination, but combining  chlordiazepoxide  with  AMPH  results  in  an inverted-U dose-response (Kelly et al. 2009).

Anabolizant androgenic steroids

Also  the  pre-exposure  to  anabolizant  androgenic  steroids (e.g.,  nandrolone)  can  modulate  the  behavioral  and  com­ pensatory  effects  of  amphetamines  in  a  dose-dependent manner,  decreasing  amphetamines  effects  at  low  doses (Kurling et al. 2008).

Possible interactions with therapeutic drugs regimens

The  most  prevalent  interactions  of  amphetamines  with medications  appear  in  cases  of  association  of  ampheta­ mines  with  antidepressants  and  anti-retro  virals.  However, several  medications  can  inhibit  the  isoenzymes  involved  in amphetamines  metabolism  (Parkinson  et  al. 2004) or interact  with  the  same  receptors,  transporters,  or  neuro­ transmitters.  Some  examples  are  haloperidol  (Liechti  et  al. 2000a), clozapine,  olanzapine  (Blessing  et  al. 2003), bar­ biturates  (Davidson  et  al. 2001), and  acetylsalicylic  acid (Davidson et al. 2001). Some  antipsychotics,  including  droperidol,  haloperidol, olanzapine,  and  pimozide  (DA  D2  receptors  antagonists), can  also  reduce  amphetamines-induced  euphoria  (Brauer and  De  Wit 1997; Liechti  et  al. 2000a) and  lower  seizure threshold,  induce  hypotension  and  dysrhythmias,  but  will impair  heat  dissipation  (Whelan  et  al. 2004), which  in  turn increases  amphetamines  toxicity.  On  the  other  hand, chlorpromazine  (a  typical  antipsychotic)  and  the  5-HT2a antagonist  cyproheptadine  appear  efficacious  in  treating 5-HT toxicity (Nisijima et al. 2001). The  sympathomimetic  medications  prescribed  to  treat some  pathologies  (e.g.,  fluoxetine,  St.  John’s  worth, 

tramadol,  venlafaxine,  lithium,  clomipramine,  MAOi 

(Smilkstein  et  al. 1987), tricyclic  antidepressants,  etc.)  can increase  the  risk  and  the  severity  of  the  pro-serotonergic/adrenergic/-dopaminergic  effects  caused  by  amphetamines consumption.  However,  the  long-term  exposure  to  the antidepressant  fluoxetine  seems  to  have  beneficial  effects regarding  the  long-term  unpleasant  effects  posterior  to amphetamines  consumption  (Thompson  et  al. 2004a). In addition,  MAOi  (Smilkstein  et  al. 1987) and  tricyclic antidepressants  also  increase  amphetamines  effects  by 

slowing down CYP450 metabolism.

Some  myorelaxants  (e.g.,  succinylcholine)  and  some anesthetics  (e.g.,  halothane)  can  cause  malignant  hyper­ thermia in predisposed individuals (Klein and Kramer 2004).

The  exposure  to  the  anti-hypertensive  drug  ketanserine reduces the perceptive effects of amphetamines (Liechti et al. 2000b), although other antihypertensives such as /(-blockers can  cause  serious  interactions  with  amphetamines,  since blockade of /l2-receptors (mediating skel etal muscle vasodi­ latation) can  produce unopposed  a-receptor stimulation  and uncontrolled hypertension (Hall and Henry 2006).

Adrenergic  /^-receptor  (e.g.,  carvedilol)  and  ai-receptor antagonists  can  reduce  MDMA-induced  hyperthermia  in rats  (Sprague  et  al. 2005). The  a,-receptor  antagonist prazozin  was  also  able  to  reverse  MDMA-associated locomotor  stimulation  (Selken  and  Nichols 2007) and vascular effects (McDaid and Docherty 2001) in rats.

The  anti-retrovirals  such  as  ritonavir  have  been  com­ monly  involved  in  potentially  lethal  interactions  with amphetamines  (Antoniou  and  Tseng 2002). These  drugs can  strongly  interact  with  a  large  number  of  compounds because  most  of  them  are  substrates  and  potent  inhibitors of  the  CYP450  system  (Antoniou  and  Tseng 2002) and were  already  associated  with  some  severe  or  even  fatal interactions  with  amphetamines  (Harrington  et  al. 1999; Henry and Hill 1998).

The  opiate  antagonist,  naltrexone,  currently  used  as  a pharmacotherapy  for  alcohol  dependence,  attenuates  the 

subjective  effects  induced  by  AMPH  in  humans  (JayaramLindstrom  et  al. 2008; Jayaram-Lindstrom  et  al. 2004) and reduces craving and the  propensity to relapse to  drug use in AMPH-dependent  patients.  In  addition,  several  experi­ mental  studies  show  that  both  naltrexone  and  the  opiate receptor  antagonist  naloxone  reduce  amphetamine-induced locomotor  activity  in  several  species  and  attenuate  the threshold  currents  for  self-stimulation  by  AMPH  in  rats  and attenuate  locomotor  behavior  in  amphetamine-conditioned animals (Haggkvist et al. 2011).

and  PK  interactions.  For  example, Ephedra  supplements, used  for  weight  loss,  cause  sympathomimetic  effects  that may  potentiate  the  acute  effects  of  amphetamines  and cause  potentially  lethal  complications  (Chen  et  al. 2004). Some  other  compounds  can  PD  interact  with  ampheta­ mines  because  they  are  MAOi  (e.g.,  coumarin,  flavones, xantones,  etc.)  (Thull  and  Testa 1994). Also  the  polycyclic aromatic  hydrocarbons  (PAHs)  present  in  charcoal-grilled food  are  known  to  induce  the  CYP450  system  (Felton  and Malfatti 2006), which  may  increase  the  toxicity  of  the amphetamines t hat are  bioactivated  by this  pathway. Some flavonoids  (quercetin,  luteoline,  apigenine,  baicalein,  crisine,  flavones)  can  induce  simultaneously  phase  I (CYP450)  and  phase  II  (UGTs)  enzymes.  Other  naturally occurring  compounds  that  can  also  induce  the  UGTs  are cumarine,  elagic  acid,  and  ferulic  acid  (Felton  and  Malfatti 2006). Finally,  there  are  several  nutritional  factors  that  can affect  the  expression  of  CYP  and  therefore  the  ampheta­ mines  toxicity  such  as:  changes  in  the  consumption  of macronutrients  (e.g.,  proteins,  carbohydrates,  lipids), changes  in  the  levels  of  micronutrients  (e.g.,  vitamins, metallic  ions),  fasting  and  reduction  of  the  caloric  intake, and  the  “non-nutrients”  present  in  the  diet  (e.g.,  dioxins, antibiotics,  growth-promoting  hormones,  environmental pollutants,  pesticides,  mycotoxins,  products  delivered  from the  packaging  material,  products  generated  during  food processing, food additives, etc.) (Ioannides 1999). From all the information compiled in this section, it is clear that the effects caused by the ingestion of an amphetamines pill can be affected by many different factors, which hampers the attribution of the observed effects only to the amphetamines. Particularly  worrying  are  the  interactions  that  may  arise between amphetamines and other drugs co-consumed inten­ tionally or inadvertently and that can be fatal. Therefore,  it  is  crucial  to  understand  the  influence  of  all these  factors  on  amphetamines  toxicity  to  establish  risk prevention measures  and develop  novel and  more effective preventive  strategies  to  decrease  risks  of  amphetamines consumers.
