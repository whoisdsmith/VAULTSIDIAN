# **Kristina Secnik, Ph.D.** **Thomas Spencer, M.D.** **T. Bedirhan Ustun, M.D.** **Ellen E. Walters, M.S.** **Alan M. Zaslavsky, Ph.D.** **Objective:** Despite  growing  interest  in adult  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disor­ der  (ADHD),  little  is  known  about  its  prev­ alence or correlates. **Method:** A  screen  for  adult  ADHD  was  in­ cluded  in  a  probability  subsample  (N  = 3,199)  of  18-44-year-old  respondents  in the  National  Comorbidity  Survey  Replica­ tion,  a  nationally  representative  house­ hold  survey  that  used  a  lay-administered diagnostic  interview  to  assess  a  wide range  of  DSM-IV  disorders.  Blinded  clini­ cal  follow-up  interviews  of  adult  ADHD 

# J. Although it  has  long  been  known  that  attention  deficit hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  often  persists  into  adult­ hood (1,  2), adult  ADHD has  only recently  become the  fo­ cus  of  widespread  clinical  attention  (3-5).  As  an  indication of this  neglect, adult  ADHD was  not included  in either  ma­ jor  U.S.  psychiatric  epidemiological  survey  of  the  past  two decades,  the  Epidemiologic  Catchment  Area  Study  (6)  or the  National  Comorbidity  Survey  (7).  Attempts  to  estimate the prevalence  of adult  ADHD by  extrapolating from  child­ hood  prevalence  estimates  linked  with  estimates  of  adult­ hood  persistence  (8-11)  and  direct  estimation  in  small subject groups  (12,13) have  yielded estimates  in the range of  l%-6%.  In  order  to  obtain  more  accurate  estimates  of prevalence and  correlates, an  adult ADHD  screen was  in­ cluded  in  the  National  Comorbidity  Survey  Replication (14),  and  clinical  reappraisal  interviews  were  carried  out with people  who had  positive results  on the  screen. These data are  used here  to estimate  the prevalence,  comorbid­ ity, and impairment of adult ADHD in the United States.

## were  carried  out  with  154  respondents, oversampling  those  with  positive  screen results.  Multiple  imputation  was  used  to estimate  prevalence  and  correlates  of  cli­ nician-assessed adult ADHD. **Results:** The  estimated  prevalence  of  cur­ rent  adult  ADHD  was  4.4%.  Significant  cor­ relates  included  being  male,  previously married,  unemployed,  and  non-Hispanic white.  Adult  ADHD  was  highly  comorbid with  many  other  DSM-IV  disorders  as­ sessed  in  the  survey  and  was  associated with  substantial  role  impairment.  The  ma­ jority  of  cases  were  untreated,  although many  individuals  had  obtained  treatment for  other  comorbid  mental  and  sub­ stance-related disorders. **Conclusions:** Efforts  are  needed  to  in­ crease  the  detection  and  treatment  of adult  ADHD.  Research  is  needed  to  deter­ mine  whether  effective  treatment  would reduce  the  onset,  persistence,  and  severity of disorders that co-occur with adult ADHD.

### **Method** **Sample** As  detailed  elsewhere  (15),  the  National  Comorbidity  Survey 

# Replication  is  a  nationally  representative  survey  of  9,282  Englishspeaking  household  residents  age  18  or  older  that  was  carried  out by  the  professional  survey  staff  of  the  Institute  for  Social  Research at  the  University  of  Michigan.  The  response  rate  was  70.9%.  Re­ cruitment  featured  an  advance  letter  and  study  fact  brochure  fol­ lowed  by  a  visit  from  an  in-person  interviewer  to  answer  ques­ tions  before  obtaining  verbal  informed  consent.  Consent  was verbal  rather  than  written  to  parallel  the  procedures  of  the  base­ line  National  Comorbidity  Survey  (7)  for  trend  comparison.  The human  subjects  committees  of  Harvard  Medical  School  and  the University of Michigan both approved these procedures. The  interview  was  in  two  parts.  Part  1  included  a  diagnostic  as­ sessment  administered  to  all  9,282  respondents.  Part  2  included additional  questions  administered  to  5,692  respondents  in  part  1 who  either  met  the  criteria  for  at  least  one  part  1  disorder  or  were part  of  a  probability  subsample  of  others.  Because  of  concern about  recall  failure  among  older  adults,  ADHD  was  assessed  in part  2  only  among  the  3,199  respondents  ages  18-44.  This  sample was  weighted  to  be  nationally  representative.  More  details  about weighting are reported elsewhere (15).

The  respondents  were  divided  into  four  strata  to  select  the  ones who  would  receive  clinical  reappraisal  interviews  to  determine 

adult  ADHD:  respondents  who  denied  ever  having  symptoms  of 

childhood  ADHD,  those  who  reported  symptoms  but  did  not meet  the  full  criteria  for  childhood  ADHD,  those  with  childhood 

cases  who  denied  adult  symptoms,  and  those  with  childhood 

cases  who  reported  adult  symptoms.  An  attempt  was  made  to 

contact  by  telephone  30  respondents  in  each  of  the  first  three 

strata  and  60  in  the  fourth  and  to  administer  a  semistructured 

clinical  interview  for  adult  ADHD  to  them.  The  final  quota  sample included  154  respondents  (slightly  more  than  the  target  because more  predesignated  respondents  kept  their  appointments  to  be interviewed  than  expected).  The  sample  was  weighted  to  be  rep­ resentative  of  the  U.S.  population  in  the  age  range  of  the  sample. Details  on  the  design  of  the  ADHD  clinical  reappraisal  are  re­ ported elsewhere (16).

**Adult ADHD**

### The  retrospective  assessment  of  childhood  ADHD  in  the  Na­ tional  Comorbidity  Survey  Replication  was  based  on  the  Diagnos­ tic  Interview  Schedule  for  DSM-IV  (17).  Respondents  classified retrospectively  as  having  had  ADHD  symptoms  in  childhood were  then  asked  a  single  question  about  whether  they  continued to  have  any  current  problems  with  attention  or  hyperactivity/impulsivity.  The  clinical  reappraisal  interview  used  the  Adult  ADHD 

Clinical  Diagnostic  Scale  version  1.2  (18,19),  a  semistructured  in­ terview  that  includes  the  ADHD  Rating  Scale  (20)  for  childhood ADHD  and  an  adaptation  of  the  ADHD  Rating  Scale  to  assess  cur­ rent  adult  ADHD.  The  Adult  ADHD  Clinical  Diagnostic  Scale  has been used in clinical trials with adult ADHD patients (21, 22).

Four  experienced  clinical  interviewers  (all  doctoral-level  clini­

cal  psychologists)  carried  out  the  clinical  reappraisal  interviews. Each  interviewer  received  40  hours  of  training  from  two  board-

certified  psychiatrist  specialists  in  adult  ADHD  (L.A.,  T.S.)  and 

successfully  completed  five  practice  interviews.  All  clinical  inter­ views  were  tape  recorded  and  reviewed  by  a  supervisor  (M.J.H.). Weekly  calibration  meetings  were  used  to  prevent  drift.  A  clinical 

diagnosis  of  adult  ADHD  required  six  symptoms  of  either  inatten­ tion  or  hyperactivity-impulsivity  during  the  6  months  before  the interview  (DSM-IV  criterion  A),  at  least  two  criterion  A  symptoms before  age  7  (criterion  B),  some  impairment  in  at  least  two  areas 

of  living  during  the  past  6  months  (criterion  C),  and  clinically  sig­ nificant  impairment  in  at  least  one  of  these  areas  (criterion  D).  No 

attempt  was  made  to  operationalize  the  DSM-IV  diagnostic  hier­

archy rules (criterion E).

**Comorbid DSM-IV Disorders**

### Other  DSM-IV  disorders  were  assessed  in  the  survey  by  using the  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  Composite  International Diagnostic  Interview  (CIDI)  version  3.0  (23),  a  fully  structured  lay-

administered  diagnostic  interview.  The  disorders  include  anxiety 

disorders,  mood  disorders,  substance  use  disorders,  and  inter­ mittent  explosive  disorder.  Rules  involving  exclusion  of  patients with  organic  causes  and  diagnostic  hierarchy  rules  were  used  in making  diagnoses.  As  detailed  elsewhere  (15),  blinded  clinical  re­

appraisal  interviews  using  the  Structured  Clinical  Interview  for DSM-IV  (SCID)  (24)  with  a  probability  subsample  of  survey  re­

spondents  showed  generally  good  concordance  of  DSM-IV  diag­ noses  based  on  the  CIDI  and  SCID,  with  an  area  under  the  re­

ceiver  operator  characteristic  curve  of  0.65-0.81  for  anxiety 

disorders,  0.75  for  major  depression,  and  0.62-0.88  for  substance use  disorders.  The  diagnosis  of  intermittent  explosive  disorder was  not  validated,  as  there  is  no  gold  standard  clinical  assessment for this disorder.

**Other Correlates of Adult ADHD**

### We  examined  associations  of  adult  ADHD  with  sociodemo-

graphic  characteristics  and  functional  disability  as  assessed  with 

the  WHO  Disability  Assessment  Schedule  (25).  This  measure  as­

sesses  the  frequency  and  intensity  of  difficulties  experienced  over 

the  past  30  days  in  each  of  three  areas  of  basic  functioning—mo­

bility  (e.g.,  walking  a  mile),  self-care  (e.g.,  getting  dressed),  and 

cognition  (e.g.,  remembering  to  do  important  things)—and  three 

areas  of  instrumental  functioning—time  out  of  role  (i.e.,  number 

of  days  totally  unable  to  carry  out  normal  daily  activities  and 

number  of  days  of  cutting  back  on  amount  done  or  time  spent  on 

daily  activities),  productive  role  performance  (e.g.,  cutting  back 

on  quality  ofwork),  and  social  role  performance  (e.g.,  controlling 

emotions  when  around  other  people).  Dichotomous  measures  of 

disability  were  defined  for  each  domain  by  giving  equal  weights  to 

frequency  and  intensity  of  impairments  and  classifying  people 

with  composite  scores  in  the  90th  percentile  as  being  disabled. 

Treatment  was  assessed  in  each  diagnostic  section  and  in  a  sepa­

rate  treatment  section  where  we  asked  about  treatment  for  any 

emotional  or  substance  use  problem.  Comparison  of  responses 

to  the  more  and  less  inclusive  questions  pinpointed  people  in 

treatment  for  comorbid  mental  or  substance-related  problems 

### Multiple  imputation  (26)  was  used  to  assign  predicted  diag­

noses  of  clinician-assessed  adult  ADHD  to  respondents  who  did 

not  participate  in  the  reappraisal  interviews.  As  will  be  detailed,  a 

strong  monotonic  relationship  was  found  between  sampling 

strata  and  blinded  clinical  diagnoses  of  adult  ADHD,  justifying 

this  use  of  multiple  imputation.  We  began  by  selecting  10  pseu-

dosamples  of  size  154  with  replacement  from  the  154  respon­

dents  in  the  clinical  calibration  sample,  estimating  predicted 

probabilities  of  adult  ADHD  in  each  sampling  stratum  of  each 

pseudosample  and  transforming  probabilities  to  case  classifica­

tions  separately  for  each  case  by  random  selection  from  the  bino­

mial  distribution  for  the  predicted  probability.  These  imputations 

were  then  used  to  create  10  separate  “data  sets”  in  which  substan­

tive  analyses  were  replicated.  The  parameter  estimates  in  these 

replications  were  averaged  to  obtain  multiple-imputation  param­

eter  estimates,  while  parameter  variance  was  estimated  by  com­

bining  the  mean  within-replication  variance  with  the  variance  of 

the  parameter  estimates  across  the  replications  by  means  of  stan­

dard  multiple-imputation  averaging  (26).  The  increase  in  vari­

ance  due  to  between-replication  variance  adjusted  for  the  vari­

ance  introduced  by  using  imputation  rather  than  direct  clinical 

Sociodemographic  correlates  were  estimated  by  using  logistic 

regression  analysis,  again  separately  in  the  10  multiple-imputa­

tion  replications.  Comorbidity  was  assessed  by  obtaining  multi­

ple-imputation  estimates  of  odds  ratios  for  the  relationship  of 

adult  ADHD  to  other  DSM-IV  disorders  in  logistic  regression 

equations  that  controlled  for  age  in  5-year  age  groups.  Functional 

disabilities  were  also  estimated  by  using  multiple-imputation  lo­

gistic  regression.  Twelve-month  treatment  was  estimated  by  us­

ing  multiple-imputation  cross-tabulations.  Because  the  sample 

design  used  weighting  and  clustering,  all  parameters  were  esti­

mated  by  using  the  Taylor  series  linearization  method  (27),  a  de­

sign-based  method  implemented  in  the  SUDAAN  software  sys­

tem  (28).  Significance  tests  of  sets  of  coefficients  used  Wald  chi-

square  tests  based  on  design-corrected  multiple-imputation  co­

efficient  variance-covariance  matrices.  Statistical  significance 

was  evaluated  by  using  two-sided  design-based  tests  with  an  al­

during  the  past  6  months  (criterion  C),  and  clinically  significant  impairment  in  at  least  one  of  these  areas  (criterion  D).  No  attempt  was  made 

### **Comorbidity With Other DSM-IV Disorders**

## Adult  ADHD  was  significantly  comorbid  with  a  wide 

### range  of  other  12-month  DSM-IV  disorders  (Table  3).  The 

### strength of  comorbidity did  not vary  greatly across  the dis­

### order  classes,  with  odds  ratios  of 2.7-7.5  for  mood  disor­

### ders,  1.5-5.5  for  anxiety  disorders,  1.5-7.9  for  substance 

### use disorders, and 3.7 for intermittent explosive disorder.

### **Basic and Instrumental Functioning**

## Adult  ADHD  was  associated  with  significantly  elevated 

### odds of  disability in  all three  dimensions of  basic function­

### ing  assessed  by  the  WHO  Disability  Assessment  Sched­

### ule—self-care  (2.2),  mobility  (3.9),  and  cognition  (2.6)—as 

### well  as  all  three  dimensions  of  instrumental  functioning— 

### days  out  of  role  (2.7),  productive  role  functioning  (2.1), 

## A  significantly  higher  proportion  of  women  than  men 

### with  adult  ADHD  had  received  treatment  for  mental  or 

### substance-related  problems  in  the  12  months  before  the 

### interview  (53.1%  versus  36.5%,  z=2.6,  p=0.02).  However, 

### only 25.2%  of the  treated respondents  had received  treat­

### ment  for  ADHD  (22.8%  of  women  and  27.7%  of  men,  z= 

### 0.5, p=0.60).  Because of  this low  proportion, only  10.9% of 

### the  respondents  with  adult  ADHD  had  received  treatment 

### for  ADHD  in  the  12  months  before  interview  (12.1%  of 

### women and 10.1% of men, z=0.4, p=0.66).

# An  important  limitation  is  that  the  DSM-IV  criteria  for 

### ADHD  were  developed  with  children  in  mind  and  offer 

### only  minimal  guidance  regarding  diagnosis  among  adults. 

### Clinical  studies  make  it  clear  that  symptoms  of  ADHD  are 

### more  heterogeneous  and  subtle  in  adults  than  children 

### (32, 33),  leading some  clinical researchers  to suggest  that

### Three  additional  limitations  are  also  noteworthy.  First, adult  ADHD  was  assessed  comprehensively  only  in  the clinical  reappraisal  subsample.  Although  the  imputation equation  was  strong,  the  need  to  impute  entire  diagnoses made  it  impossible  to  carry  out  symptom-level  investiga­ tions  of  possibilities  such  as  greater  prominence  of  inat­ tentive  symptoms,  relative  to  hyperactive/impulsive

conservative,  although  the  only  study  we  know  of  that compared  self  and  informant  assessments  of  adult  ADHD in  nonclinical  subjects  showed  fairly  strong  associations between the two reports (41). Third,  even  though  the  semistructured  interview  used in  the  clinical  reappraisal  interviews,  the  Adult  ADHD Clinical Diagnostic  Scale, had  been used  in clinical  studies of  adult  ADHD,  there  is  no  standard  method  for  clinical validation  of  adult  ADHD  with  the  same  level  of  accep­ tance as the SCID  has for anxiety, mood,  or substance use disorders, limiting the interpretability of results. Within  the  context  of  these  limitations,  the  results  re­ ported  document  that  adult  ADHD  is  common  and  often produces  serious  impairment.  The  4.4%  estimated  preva­ lence is  in the  middle of  previous estimates.  This estimate is likely to be conservative for the reasons we have just de­ scribed.  The  findings  that  adult  ADHD  is  associated  with unemployment  and  with  being  previously  married  are broadly consistent  with results  from studies  that have  doc­ umented adverse effects of adult ADHD (8, 42). The analy­ ses of responses to the WHO Disability Assessment Sched­ ule  are  also  consistent  with  this  broad  pattern.  However, the  disability  results  might  underrepresent  ADHD  impair­ ments because  some dimensions  of the  scale tap  areas in which  ADHD  does  not  produce  great  impairment  (e.g.,

### and because the scale does not assess many dimensions in which people  with ADHD  are thought  to function  least ad­

### equately  (e.g.,  poor  sleep  and  nutrition,  accidents,  and 

### smoking are  common). In  addition, as  already noted,  peo­ ple  with  ADHD  might  have  poor  insight  into  their  impair­ ments,  leading  to  underestimation  of  scores  on  the  WHO Disability Assessment Schedule.

### The  finding  of  low  prevalences  among  Hispanics  and non-Hispanic  blacks  was  unexpected.  As  the  DSM-IV ADHD  field  trials  indicated  no  effects  of  race/ethnicity 

### (43),  these  findings  in  the  National  Comorbidity  Survey Replication  could  reflect  a  race/ethnic  difference  in  adult persistence,  in  accuracy  of  adult  self-report,  in  cultural perceptions  of  the  acceptability  of  ADHD  symptoms,  or

This  indirectly  suggests  that  the  high  proportion  of women in  adult ADHD  patient groups  is due  to help  seek­ ing  or  recognition  bias  (46).  The  finding  that  adult  ADHD

is  highly  comorbid  is  consistent  with  clinical  evidence 

### (42).  Methodological  analysis  has  shown  that  these  co­ morbidities  are  not  due  to  overlap  of  symptoms,  impreci­

### sion  of  diagnostic  criteria,  or  other  methodological  con­ founds (47).

### The  average  magnitude  of  the  odds  ratios  reflecting  the relationship  between  adult  ADHD  and  other  comorbid 

### disorders  is  comparable  to  those  for  most  of  the  DSM-IV 

### anxiety  and  mood  disorders  assessed  in  the  survey  (48). The  absence  of  strong  variation in  comorbidity  odds ratios was  surprising,  as  family  studies  would  lead  us  to  predict high  comorbidities  with  major  depression  (49),  bipolar 

### disorder (50,  51), and  conduct disorder  (52, 53)  and lower 

### comorbidity  with  anxiety  disorders  (54).  One  striking  im­ plication  of  the  high  overall  comorbidity  is  that m any p eo­ ple  with  adult  ADHD  are  in  treatment  for  other  mental  or 

### substance use disorders but not  for ADHD. The 10% of re ­

### spondents  diagnosed  with ADH D  who  had received  treat­ ment for adult  ADHD is much  lower than the  rates for anx­==== iety,  mood,  or  substance  use  disorders  (55).  Direct-to-

### consumer  outreach  and  physician  education  are  needed to address this problem.

### The  comorbidity  findings  raise  the  question  of  whether 

### early  successful  treatment  of  childhood  ADHD  would  in­ fluence secondary  adult disorders.  The fact  that a  diagno­

### sis of adult  ADHD requires at  least some symptoms  to be­ gin before  age 7  means that  the vast  majority of  comorbid 

### conditions  are  temporally  secondary  to  adult  ADHD.  We know  from  the  Multimodal  Treatment  Study  of  ADHD  that 

### successful  treatment  of  childhood  ADHD  also  reduces 

### childhood  symptoms  of  comorbid  disorders  (56).  Indirect 

### evidence  suggests  that  stimulant  treatment  of  childhood ADHD might reduce  subsequent risk of  substance use dis­

### orders (57),  although this  is not  definitive because  of pos­

### sible  sample  selection  bias.  Long-term  prospective  re­

### search  using  quasi-experimental  methods  is  needed  to resolve this uncertainty.

### A  related  question  is  whether  adult  treatment  of  ADHD would have any effects on the severity or persistence of co­ morbid  disorders.  A  question  could  also  be  raised  as  to whether  ADHD  explains  part  of  the  adverse  effects  found in  studies  of  comorbid  DSM  disorders.  A  number  of  stud­ ies,  for  example,  have  documented  high  societal  costs  of 

### anxiety  disorders  (58,  59),  mood  disorders  (60,  61),  and 

### substance use  disorders (62,  63), but  these all  ignored the role of  comorbid ADHD  Reanalysis might  find that  comor­ bid  ADHD  accounts  for p art,  possibly a substa ntial part,  of the effects previously attributed to these other disorders. **Acknowledgments**
