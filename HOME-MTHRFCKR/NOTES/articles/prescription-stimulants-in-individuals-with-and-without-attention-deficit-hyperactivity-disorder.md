**Abstract**

#### Prescription  stimulants  are  often  used  to  treat  attention  deficit  hyperactivity 

disorder  (ADHD).  Drugs  like  methylphenidate  (Ritalin,  Concerta),  dextro­

amphetamine  (Dexedrine),  and  dextroamphetamine-amphetamine  (Adderall) 

help  people  with  ADHD  feel  more  focused.  However,  misuse  of  stimulants  by 

ADHD  and  nonaffected  individuals  has  dramatically  increased  over  recent  years 

based  on  students’  misconceptions  or  simple  lack  of  knowledge  of  associated 

risks.  In  this  review,  we  discuss  recent  advances  in  the  use  and  increasing  mis­

use  of  prescription  stimulants  among  high  school  and  college  students  and  ath­

letes.  Given  the  widespread  belief  that  stimulants  enhance  performance,  there 

are  in  fact  only  a  few  studies  reporting  the  cognitive  enhancing  effects  of  stimu­

lants  in  ADHD  and  nonaffected  individuals.  Student  athletes  should  be  apprised 

of  the  very  serious  consequences  that  can  emerge  when  stimulants  are  used  to 

improve  sports  performance.  Moreover,  misuse  of  stimulants  is  associated  with 

dangers  including  psychosis,  myocardial  infarction,  cardiomyopathy,  and  even 

sudden  death.  As  ADHD  medications  are  prescribed  for  long-term  treatment, 

there  is  a  need  for  long-term  safety  studies  and  education  on  the  health  risks 

associated with misuse is imperative.

**Introduction** Attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  a 

# treatable  neurobehavioral  disorder  that  is  defined  by  per­ sistent  and  maladaptive  symptoms  of  hyperactivity/impulsivity  and  inattention  (American  Psychiatric  Association 2000).  ADHD  is  one  of  the  most  common  psychiatric conditions  of  childhood  (Wilens  et  al.  2002).  Based  on the  Heath  Resources  and  Services  Administration’s National  Survey  of  Children’s  Health,  the  percentage  of children  aged  4—17  years  diagnosed  with  ADHD  increased from  7.8%  in  2003  to  9.5%  in  2007,  representing  a  21.8% increase  in  just  4  years  (Centers  for  Disease  Control  and Prevention  2010).  ADHD  is  diagnosed  in  boys  at  a  rate  of two  to  four  times  that  of  girls,  although  this  observation may  be  the  result  of  referral  patterns  from  teachers 

(Sciutto  et  al.  2004;  Kutcher  2011).  Although  ADHD  was once  regarded  as  a  disorder  of  childhood  and  adolescence, an  estimated  50%  of  patients  diagnosed  with  ADHD under  the  age  of  18  years  continue  to  have  symptoms  as 

an  adult  (Wilens  et  al.  2004).  Overall,  the  prevalence  of 

ADHD in adults ranges from 3.5% to 4.5% (Kessler et al.

2006)  .  Differences  across  ethnic  groups  within  the  United 

States  are  sometimes  found,  but  seem  to  be  more  of  the 

function of social class than ethnicity (Bloom and Cohen

2007)  .  ADHD  is  found  in  all  countries  surveyed  with 

rates  similar  to,  if  not  higher  than,  those  found  in  North 

America  (Faraone  et  al.  2007;  Polanczyk  et  al.  2007). 

Thus,  adult  ADHD  is  one  of  the  most  common  adult 

psychiatric disorders.

Individuals  with  ADHD  often  have  substantial  func­

tional  impairment  in  academic,  family,  and  social  settings. 

Youth  with  ADHD  are  at  an  increased  risk  for  academic 

failure  because  of  learning  or  language  problems.  Other 

consequences  associated  with  ADHD  include  dangerous 

driving,  impaired  peer  relationships,  delinquent  behavior, 

and  impulsive  sexuality  (Putukian  et  al.  2011;  Visser  et  al. 

2012).  Moreover,  when  ADHD  is  untreated,  there  is 

increased  prevalence  of  certain  psychological  disorders 

(e.g.,  major  depression,  bipolar  disorder,  conduct

disorder,  oppositional-defiant  disorder,  antisocial  person­ ality,  substance  use,  and  anxiety)  (Faraone  et  al.  1997; Rasmussen  and  Gillberg  2000;  Kollins  et  al.  2005;  Biederman  et  al.  2006).  However,  early  treatment  may  decrease negative  outcomes  of  ADHD  including  the  rate  of  con­ duct  disorder  and  adult  antisocial  personality  disorder (Dopheide and Pliszka 2009). There  are  both  pharmacological  and  nonpharmacological  (e.g.,  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  [CBT])  treatments of  ADHD.  Stimulants,  such  as  methylphenidate  (MPH; Ritalin  and  Concerta)  and  dextroamphetamine-AMP (d-AMP;  Adderall)  are  the  most  common  pharmacologic treatments  (The  MTA  Cooperative  Group  1999)  and abundant  data  support  the  potentially  positive  effects  of prescription  stimulants  for  the  majority  of  children,  ado­ lescents,  and  adults  with  ADHD.  Experts  estimate  that approximately  60%  of  children  with  ADHD  are  treated with  prescription  stimulants  (Center  for  Disease  Control and  Prevention  2005a);  therefore,  approximately  three million  children  in  this  country  take  stimulants  for  prob­ lems  with  focusing.  At  the  same  time,  many  studies  have revealed  the  numerous  adverse  effects  associated  with  pre­ scription stimulants when they are used inappropriately. Stimulants  are  classified  as  Schedule  II  drugs  (i.e.,  pro­ viding  positive  medicinal  effects  but  also  considerable abuse  potential).  The  nonmedical  use  of  prescription stimulants  represents  the  second  common  most  form  of illicit  drug  use  in  college,  second  only  to  marijuana  use (Johnston  et  al.  2004).  Indeed,  many  consider  stimulants —  whether  obtained  by  prescription  or  illicitly  —  a  conve­ nient  option  to  improve  performance  or  to  induce euphoria  (get  “high”).  Major  daily  newspapers  such  as The  New  York  Times  have  reported  a  trend  toward  grow­ ing  use  of  prescription  stimulants,  commonly  called “smart  pills,”  by  high  school  and  college  students  for enhancing  school  or  work  performance  (Jacobs  2005). Unfortunately,  media  reports  appear  to  condone  this behavior  as  95%  of  articles  mentioned  at  least  one  possi­ ble  benefit  of  using  a  prescription  stimulant  for  neuroen­ hancement,  but  only  58%  mentioned  any  risks/side  effects (Partridge  et  al.  2011).  Stimulant  misuse  is  often  pre­ dicted  on  individuals’  misconceptions  or  simple  lack  of knowledge of associated risks. This  review  discusses  recent  studies  regarding  the  use and  misuse  of  stimulants  among  high  school  and  college students,  including  athletes,  with  and  without  ADHD. Given  the  widespread  belief  that  prescription  stimulants are  “smart  pills,”  we  address  if  these  drugs  actually enhance  cognition  in  a  healthy  individual.  Athletes  may see  stimulants  as  a  way  to  help  maintain  physical  fitness for  their  competitive  sport  or  to  improve  their  concentra­ tion.  Finally,  we  elaborate  on  the  long-term  effects  of chronic  stimulant  use.  Addiction  and  tolerance  are  major

concerns,  as  are  psychosis  and  cardiovascular  effects.  Sur­ prisingly,  these  associated  risks  of  stimulant  misuse  are not  frequently  addressed  in  the  media  and  literature. Clearly,  the  widespread  misuse  of  prescription  stimulants represents  an  important  public  health  issue  faced  by  stu­ dents, school officials, health centers, and parents.

**Methods** This  review  was  initiated  with  a  PubMed  search  of  the 

# US  National  Library  of  Medicine  with  combinations  of the  following  key  words:  “Adderall,”  “amphetamine,” 

“methylphenidate,”  “dexamphetamine,”  “ADHD,”  “mis­ use,”  “illicit  use,”  “non-prescription  use,”  “non-medical use,”  “diversion,”  “students,”  and  “athletes.”  A  review  of all  titles  was  conducted  to  include  only  pertinent  publica­ tions.  A  hand  search  of  psychiatry  journals  was  performed and reference lists from relevant studies were searched.

**Prescription stimulant use in ADHD** It  is  estimated  that  about  two-thirds  of  the  children  diag­

# nosed  with  ADHD  receive  pharmacological  treatment 

(Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  2010)  and the  majority  of  medications  used  are  stimulants  (Center for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  2005b).  The  pre­ scribed  use  of  stimulant  medications  to  treat  ADHD  in children  age  18  and  younger  rose  steadily  from  1996  to 2008,  from  an  estimated  2.4%  in  1996  to  an  estimated 

3.5%  of  US  children  in  2008  (Zuvekas  and  Vitiello  2011). Overall,  prescription  stimulant  use  among  6-  to  12-yearolds  is  highest,  going  from  4.2%  in  1996  to  5.1%  in  2008; however,  the  fastest  growth  rate  occurred  among 

13-18  year  olds,  going  from  2.3%  in  1996  to  4%  in  2008. Prescription  stimulant  use  remained  consistently  low  in the  West  than  in  other  US  regions  and  in  lower  racial/ ethnic minorities.

MPH  and  d-AMP  are  the  most  widely  used  prescrip­ tion  stimulants  approved  by  the  US  Food  and  Drug Administration  (FDA)  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD.  MPH is  a  short-acting  stimulant  drug.  Generic  MPH  is  available in  many  forms,  and  several  versions  of  the  long-acting MPH  have  been  introduced,  with  Concerta  getting  the largest  share  of  the  market.  According  to  the  U.S.  Drug Enforcement  Administration  (DEA),  MPH  has  been  the fourth  most  prescribed  controlled  substance  in  the  United States  since  2003,  with  over  58,000  Americans  purchasing MPH  in  2006  (Department  of  Justice:  Drug  Enforcement Administration  2008).  Both  the  production  and  prescrip­ tion  of  MPH  has  risen  as  the  diagnosis  of  ADHD  has concurrently  increased.  In  addition,  with  the  realization that  ADHD  is  a  lifelong  disorder,  MPH  has  become  more commonly  prescribed  for  adolescents  and  adults,  and

treatment  duration  has  increased  (Horrigan  2001).  Both MPH  and  d-AMP  are  efficacious  and  well-tolerated  medi­ cations  and  remain  the  first  choice  for  short  duration management  in  adolescent  and  adult  ADHD  (Faraone and  Glatt  2010).  Although  the  precise  mechanisms  under­ lying  the  action  of  these  medications  are  not  completely understood,  they  appear  to  increase  the  availability  of dopamine,  which  could  account  for  their  therapeutic effects.

Although  ADHD  is  a  multifactorial  disorder,  disrupted dopamine  (DA)  neurotransmission  plays  an  important role  in  its  pathophysiology.  In  addition,  polymorphisms in  the  dopamine  DI  receptor  (DRD1)  are  associated  with the  disorder  (Misener  et  al.  2004).  MPH  and  d-AMP  both enhance  DA  signaling  in  the  brain.  MPH  increases  DA  by blocking  dopamine  transporters  (DATs)  and  AMP  by releasing  DA  from  the  nerve  terminal  using  the  DAT  as carrier  (Kuczenski  and  Segal  1997).  In  healthy  controls and  in  adolescents  and  adults  with  ADHD  (Rosa-Neto et  al.  2005;  Volkow  et  al.  2007),  MPH  significantly increased  DA  in  the  ventral  striatum  (VS)  (Volkow  et  al. 2012),  a  crucial  brain  region  involved  with  motivation and  reward  (Wise  2002).  Moreover,  intravenous  MPHinduced  increases  in  DA  in  the  VS  were  correlated  with improvement  in  symptoms  of  inattention  after  long-term oral  MPH  treatment.  Historically,  the  core  feature  of ADHD  has  been  characterized  as  one  of  attention  deficit, but  increasing  evidence  suggests  that  a  reward  and  moti­ vation  deficit  may  be  of  equal  importance.  It  has  been proposed  that  increasing  DA  in  the  VS  would  enhance the  saliency  of  the  task,  thus  improving  attention  in ADHD  (Volkow  et  al.  2012).  Intravenous  MPH  also  sig­ nificantly  increased  DA  in  the  prefrontal  and  temporal cortices  that  were  associated  with  decreased  ratings  of inattention, which may be therapeutically relevant.

The  widespread  use  of  prescription  stimulants  for ADHD  has  not  been  without  critics.  In  recent  months, we  have  heard  speculation  about  whether  ADHD  is  a  real disease,  and  if  it  is  real,  whether  it  is  being  grossly  over­ diagnosed.  Disorders  often  become  widely  diagnosed  after drugs  come  along  that  can  alter  a  set  of  suboptimal behaviors.  In  this  way,  Ritalin  and  Adderall  helped  make ADHD  a  household  name.  If  there  is  a  pill  that  can  clear up  the  wavering  focus  of  sleep-deprived  youth,  then  those rather  ordinary  states  may  come  to  be  seen  as  syndrome. A  recent  opinion  piece  entitled  “Ritalin  Gone  Wrong”  in the New  York  Times  (Sroufe  2012)  by  psychology  profes­ sor  L.  Alan  Sroufe  argues  that  attention-deficit  drugs  do more  harm  than  good  over  the  long  term,  a  conclusion other  professionals  in  his  field  dispute.  Studies  have shown  that  children  who  take  MPH  can  show  reductions in  ADHD  symptomatology  (inattention,  hyperactivity, and  impulsivity)  and  gains  in  social  and  classroom

behaviors.  Studies  of  adults  with  ADHD  have  confirmed 

its  usefulness  for  this  population  as  well.  However,  the 

benefits  of  prescription  stimulants  on  ADHD  symptom­

atology do not appear to last long.

The  Multimodal  Treatment  Study  of  Children  with 

ADHD  (MTA)  compared  four  distinct  treatment  strate­

gies  during  childhood  for  children  diagnosed  with  DSM-

IV  ADHD,  Combined  Type  (The  MTA  Cooperative 

Group  1999).  Children  were  randomly  assigned  to 

14  months  of  (a)  systematic  medication  management 

(MedMgt),  which  was  initial  placebo-controlled  titration, 

three  times  a  day  dosing,  7  days  a  week,  and  monthly 

30-min  clinic  visits,  (b)  multicomponent  behavior  therapy 

(Beh),  which  included  27-session  group  parent  training 

supplemented  with  eight  individual  parent  sessions,  an 

8-week  summer  treatment  program,  12  weeks  of 

classroom  administered  behavior  therapy  with  a  half-time 

aide,  and  ten  teacher  consultation  sessions,  (c)  their 

combination  (Comb),  or  (d)  usual  community  care  (CC). 

This  randomized,  six-site,  controlled  clinical  trial  featured 

rigorous  diagnostic  criteria  at  study  entry  and  compared 

the  relative  effectiveness  of  treatments  of  well-established 

efficacy.  The  initial  MTA  findings  reported  that  all  groups 

showed  improvement  over  baseline  at  the  end  of  the 

14-month  treatment  period;  however,  the  Comb  and 

MedMgt  group  participants  showed  significantly  greater 

improvements  in  ADHD  symptoms  than  did  the  Beh  or 

CC  participants.  By  the  next  follow-up,  3  years  after 

enrollment,  there  were  no  longer  significant  treatment 

group  differences  in  ADHD  symptoms  or  functioning 

(Jensen  et  al.  2007).  Molina  et  al.  (Molina  et  al.  2009) 

reported  the  next  two  follow-up  assessments  of  the  MTA 

sample  at  6  and  8  years  after  random  assignment,  when 

the  sample  ranged  in  age  from  13  to  18  years  and  found 

similar findings.

**Prevalence of pr escription stimulant** 

# **misuse**

# The  misuse  of  a  stimulant  medication  —  taking  a  stimu­

lant  not  prescribed  by  a  physician  or  in  a  manner  not  in 

accordance  with  physician  guidance  —  has  been  growing 

over  the  past  two  decades.  In  fact,  in  the  past  10  years 

there  has  been  a  surge  in  prevalence  rates  of  non­

prescription  stimulant  use  among  both  adolescents  and 

young  adults.  In  general,  nonprescription  use  of  MPH  in 

2000  was  reported  as  1.2%  and  in  2006  this  number  had 

risen  to  2%.  Breaking  the  sample  down  by  age,  nonpre­

scription  use  among  adolescents  (ages  12-17)  went  from 

2.2%  to  1.8%  between  2000  and  2006,  a  slight  decrease. 

Among  college-aged  individuals  (ages  18—25),  however, 

usage  increased  significantly  from  3.6%  in  2000  to  5.4% 

by  2006.  Finally,  among  those  26  and  older,  usage  is  the

lowest  of  any  group,  but  rates  are  rising.  In  2000,  only 0.7%  reported  any  lifetime  usage  of  MPH,  but  this  num­ ber had doubled to 1.5% by 2006 (Bogle and Smith 2009). The  majority  of  research  on  the  misuse  of  prescription stimulants  has  focused  on  undergraduate  college  students. The  nonprescription  use  of  stimulants  has  increased  in this  population,  to  the  extent  that  the  misuse  of  prescrip­ tion  stimulants  is  second  only  to  marijuana  as  the  most common  form  of  illicit  drug  use  among  college  students (Johnston  et  al.  2004).  A  2001  nationwide  self-reported survey  of  more  than  10,000  students  from  4-year  univer­ sities  in  the  United  States  reported  a  6.9%  lifetime  preva­ lence  of  nonprescription  stimulant  misuse,  including  a past-year  prevalence  of  4.1%  and  a  past-month  prevalence of  2.1%  (McCabe  et  al.  2005).  Colleges  with  the  highest past-year  prevalence  rates  were  typically  located  in  the northeastern  United  States,  which  is  corroborated  by other  reports  (McCabe  et  al.  2005).  A  study  by  Teter et  al.  (2005)  of  9161  undergraduates  reported  an  8.1% lifetime  nonprescription  stimulant  misuse  rate  among  col­ lege  students,  including  5.4%  over  the  past  year.  Accord­ ing  to  a  2002  survey  of  a  single  US  college,  35.5%  of undergraduates  reported  using  stimulants  without  a  pre­ scription,  with  greater  frequency  occurring  in  males  com­ pared with females (Low and Gendaszek 2002). The  majority  of  nonprescription  stimulant  users reported  obtaining  the  drugs  from  a  peer  with  a  prescrip­ tion  -  a  process  termed  diversion.  The  diversion  of  stim­ ulants  is  very  common  and  can  begin  in  childhood, adolescence,  or  young  adulthood.  A  study  conducted  by Wilens  et  al.  (2008)  reported  that  lifetime  rates  of  diver­ sion  ranged  from  16%  to  29%  of  students  with  stimulant prescriptions  asked  to  give,  sell,  or  trade  their  medications (Wilens  et  al.  2008).  One  survey  reported  that  23.3%  of middle  and  high  school  students  taking  prescribed  stimu­ lants  had  been  solicited  to  divert  their  medication  to  oth­ ers  at  a  rate  that  increased  from  middle  school  to  high school  (McCabe  et  al.  2004).  A  review  of  161  elementary and  high  school  students  prescribed  the  stimulant  MPH revealed  that  they  had  been  asked  to  give  or  sell  their medication  to  others  (Musser  et  al.  1998).  Data  has shown  that  the  diversion  continues  among  college  stu­ dents.  McCabe  et  al.  found  54%  of  college  students  who were  prescribed  stimulants  for  ADHD  had  been approached  to  divert  their  medication  (McCabe  and  Boyd 2005).  Nearly  29%  of  334  college  students  had  sold  or given their medication to others (Upadhyaya et al. 2005). McCabe  et  al.  (2005)  examined  the  prevalence  rates and  correlates  of  nonprescription  use  of  stimulants  (Rita­ lin,  Adderall,  or  Dexedrine)  among  US  college  students and  found  evidence  that  misuse  is  more  prevalent  among particular  subgroups  of  US  college  students  and  types  of

colleges.  The  lifetime  prevalence  of  nonprescription stimulant  use  was  6.9%,  past-year  prevalence  was  4.1%, and  past-month  prevalence  was  2.1%.  Multivariate analysis  indicated  that  nonprescription  use  was  higher among  college  students  who  were  male,  white,  members of  fraternities  and  sororities  and  earned  lower  grade  point averages.  Wilens  et  al.  (2008)  reported  similar  findings. Rates  were  higher  at  colleges  located  in  the  northeastern region  of  the  United  States  and  colleges  with  more competitive  admission  standards.  Nonprescription stimulant  users  were  more  likely  to  report  use  of  alcohol, cigarettes,  marijuana,  ecstasy,  cocaine,  and  other  risky behaviors.  Among  college  students,  available  evidence suggests  that  individuals  who  misuse  MPH  were  more likely  to  be  white,  male,  affiliated  with  a  formally organized  fraternity,  and  more  likely  to  use  other  illicit and illegal substances (Bogle and Smith 2009).

A  descriptive,  nonexperimental,  cross-sectional  study examined  the  nonprescription  use  of  stimulants  among student  pharmacists  (Lord  et  al.  2003).  Lifetime  preva­ lence  of  stimulant  misuse  was  7%  and  was  more  likely  in students  who  were  white,  older,  and  fraternity  or  sorority members,  whereas  past-year  misuse  was  more  likely  in whites  and  low  academic  achievers.  A  recent  survey  found that  the  misuse  of  prescription  stimulants  is  also  rampant among  dental  and  dental  hygiene  students  (McNiel  et  al. 2011).  The  survey,  which  was  mailed  to  dental  education institutions  in  the  south-central  region  of  the  United States,  found  that  12.4%  of  these  students  used  a  stimu­ lant  without  a  prescription  and,  of  those,  70%  took  it  to improve  attention  and/or  concentration.  The  most  com­ monly  reported  stimulant  medication  used  was  Adderall 

(77%).  The  majority  (87%)  of  the  students  obtained  the medication  through  friends,  and  90%  began  using  the drug  in  college.  Interestingly,  17%  of  the  students  sur­ veyed  felt  it  was  easy  to  obtain  stimulant  medication  for use  at  their  school,  and  17%  thought  it  was  a  problem within  their  institution.  The  use,  misuse,  and  diversion  of prescription  stimulants  among  middle  and  high  school students  were  also  examined  by  McCabe  et  al.  (2005).  In this  study,  the  odds  for  nonprescription  stimulant  use were  lower  among  African  American  students  and  higher among  those  students  with  no  plans  for  attending  college. These  students  also  had  the  highest  rates  of  alcohol  and other drug use.

The  prevalence  of  prescription  stimulant  misuse  in medical  students  is  also  high.  In  fact,  discussion  based websites  such  as  Facebook,  Medical  School  Forum,  and The  Student  Doctor  Network  are  rife  with  Adderall 

“experts”  and  informal  question-and-answer  sessions  on the  drug.  An  anonymous  survey  was  administered  to 388  medical  students  (84.0%  return  rate)  across  all 4  years  of  education  at  a  public  medical  college.  More

than  10%  of  medical  students  reported  using  stimulants to  improve  academic  performance.  ADHD  was  diag­ nosed  in  5.5%  of  students  and  72.2%  of  those  students were diagnosed after the age of 18 years (Tuttle et al. 2010).  This  study  suggests  that  medical  students  appear to  be  a  relatively  high-risk  population  for  prescription stimulant  misuse.  Several  officials  now  say  the  problem is  increasing  in  medical  schools  (Harris  2009).  “During the  last  few  years,  the  number  of  requests  for  ADD evaluations  has  hugely  increased,”  Paula  Stoessel,  Ph.D., director  of  mental  health  services  for  physicians  in training  at  the  University  of  California,  Los  Angeles, David  Geffen  School  of  Medicine.  “We  make  them [medical  students]  go  through  a  lot  before  we  hand  out medication,  but  I’ve  heard  them  talk  about  [obtaining Adderall  prescriptions]  in  passing.”  Clearly,  the  results emphasize  the  need  for  education  about  stimulants  and their adverse side effects.

**Why are prescriptio n stimulants** 

# **misused?** The  reasons  why  prescription  stimulants  are  misused  are 

# numerous  and  include  achieving  euphoria,  and  helping cope  with  stressful  factors  related  to  their  educational environment.  According  to  a  survey  of  334  ADHDdiagnosed  college  students  taking  prescription  stimulants, 25%  misused  their  own  prescription  medications  to  get “high”  (Upadhyaya  et  al.  2005).  Like  cocaine,  MPH inhibits  the  DAT,  which  increases  synaptic  levels  of  DA, and  this  is  presumed  to  mediate  MPH’s  reinforcing  effects and  abuse  potential.  In  laboratory  studies,  it  has  been shown  that  animals  will  repeatedly  administer  MPH  as they  do  cocaine  (Kollins  2003),  and  humans  receiving both  drugs  indicate  a  similar  “high”  (Volkow  et  al.  1995). A  frequent  concern  regarding  the  use  of  stimulants  for ADHD  is  their  mechanism  of  action,  which  increases  DA and  thus  may  increase  the  risk  for  overt,  illicit  drug  use. However,  research  points  to  the  conclusion  that  people  of any  age  receiving  a  stimulant  for  ADHD  have  no  greater risk  for  illicit  substance  abuse  compared  with  the  general population (Wilens 2003). Stimulants  are  especially  popular  at  the  end  of  a  school term  when  students  will  often  use  the  drugs  to  stay  awake through  the  night  to  study  for  exams  or  complete  aca­ demic  projects.  In  fact,  prescription  stimulants  are  most commonly  misused  to  enhance  school  performance. According  to  a  Web  survey  of  115  ADHD-diagnosed  col­ lege  students,  enhancing  the  ability  to  study  outside  of class  was  the  primary  motive  for  misuse  (Rabiner  et  al. 2009).  Pressures  such  as  a  persistent  desire  to  succeed academically,  poor  sleep  habits  due  to  large  workloads, and  the  persistence  of  underlying  social  and  financial

demands  may  place  students  at  an  increased  risk  for  mis­ use  of  various  drugs,  including  stimulants  (Kadison  2005; Teter  et  al.  2005).  Students  who  misused  ADHD  medica­ tions  generally  felt  that  doing  so  was  helpful.  Thus,  pre­ scription  stimulants  developed  to  help  children  with ADHD  improve  their  focus  and  attention  are  often  mis­ used  by  the  patient,  especially  ADHD  patients  with  con­ duct disorder or comorbid substance abuse (Kollins 2008).  Moreover,  students  without  ADHD  misuse  stimu­ lants  to  improve  performance  or  to  induce  euphoria.  A web-based  survey  administered  to  medical  and  health profession  students  found  that  the  most  common  reason for  nonprescription  stimulant  use  was  to  focus  and  con­ centrate  during  studying  (93.5%)  (Herman  et  al.  2011). In  this  study,  approximately  10.4%  of  students  surveyed 

(45.2%  female;  83.9%  male;  83.9%  Caucasian)  have  either used  a  stimulant  or  are  currently  using  prescription  stim­ ulants,  and  the  most  commonly  abused  stimulant 

(71.4%)  was  d-AMP.  A  recent  survey  found  that  70%  of dental  and  dental  hygiene  students  used  a  prescription stimulant  nonmedically  to  improve  attention  and/or  con­ centration  (McNiel  et  al.  2011).  Student  pharmacists 

(Lord  et  al.  2003)  and  medical  students  (Tuttle  et  al. 2010)  are  also  using  stimulants  to  improve  concentration and academic performance.

**Effects of prescription stimulants on** 

# **cognition in ADHD** Neuropsychological  studies  of  ADHD  children  and  adults 

# indicate  impairments  in  many  cognitive  areas  including selective  attention,  memory,  reaction  time,  information processing  speed,  and  executive  control  function  such  as set-shifting,  and  working  memory.  The  benefits  of  pre­ scription  stimulants  for  enhancing  classroom  manageabil­ ity  and  increasing  attention  and  academic  productivity  in children  are  well  established.  Prescription  stimulants  may increase  the  quality  of  note  taking,  scores  on  quizzes  and worksheets,  writing  output,  and  homework  completion. Nevertheless,  they  do  not  normalize  the  ability  to  learn and  apply  knowledge  (Advokat  2010).  In  fact,  it  has  been recognized  over  30  years  that  there  is  little  evidence  that prescription  stimulants  such  as  MPH  and  AMP  improve the  academic  achievement  of  ADHD-diagnosed  children. Children  with  ADHD  have  a  consistently  lower  full-scale IQ  than  normal  controls.  They  score  significantly  lower on  reading  and  arithmetic  tests,  use  more  remedial  aca­ demic  services,  and  are  more  likely  to  be  placed  in  a  spe­ cial  education  class,  or  repeat  a  grade  compared  with controls.  They  also  take  more  years  to  complete  high school  and  have  lower  rates  of  college  attendance 

(Advokat  2010).  Thus,  prescription  stimulants  have  only a modest impact on these outcomes.

**Stimulants in Individuals With and Without ADHD**S. E. Lakhan & A. Kirchgessner

The  first  review  to  describe  the  general  academic  func­ tioning  of  adults  with  ADHD  summarized  the  results from  23  studies  (Weyandt  and  DuPaul  2006).  ADHDdiagnosed  college  students  were  found  to  have  signifi­ cantly  lower  grade  point  averages,  report  more  “academic problems”  and  to  be  less  likely  to  graduate  from  college. Nevertheless,  ADHD-diagnosed  college  students  did  not differ  in  IQ  from  those  without  ADHD,  and  were  shown to  be  able  to  meet  the  demands  of  college  courses.  On psychological  tests,  they  showed  significant  deficits  in attention,  but  were  not  different  from  normal  students  on other  measures,  such  as  the  ability  to  be  flexible  and  to maintain  performance,  as  task  demands  varied  (Weyandt and  DuPaul  2006).  More  recent  reports  have  reached  sim­ ilar  conclusions.  Interestingly,  like  elementary  and  high school  students,  college  students  with  ADHD  are  less likely  to  reach  the  same  academic  level  as  their  non­ ADHD  counterparts,  even  when  they  use  stimulant  medi­ cations.  Thus,  stimulant  medications  do  not  necessarily equalize  academic  achievement  in  the  typical  adult  with ADHD.

A  recent  controlled,  cross-sectional  study  evaluated  the effects  of  stimulants  on  cognition  in  adults  with  ADHD and  found  that  treated  ADHD  subjects  had  significantly better  scores  on  measures  of  IQ  than  did  untreated patients  (Biederman  et  al.  2012).  Thus,  either  good  cogni­ tive  functioning  may  be  a  determinant  of  seeking  treat­ ment  or  stimulant  treatment  may  improve  cognition  in adults  with  ADHD.  When  ADHD  studies  address  the issue  of  cognition,  they  usually  demonstrate  that  treated patients  perform  better  than  untreated  patients  on  neuro­ psychological  tests  or  measures  after  they  are  treated. Whether  treatment  normalizes  neurocognitive  perfor­ mance  is  rarely  addressed.  In  fact,  adults  with  ADHD  are less  likely  to  attain  the  same  educational  levels  as  those without  the  diagnosis  relative  to  what  would  be  predicted based  on  their  IQ,  and  this  outcome  does  not  appear  to be  improved  by  stimulant  medication.  In  one  recent study,  for  example,  although  84%  of  ADHD-diagnosed adults  were  statistically  expected  to  be  college  graduates, only  50%  reached  this  level  of  education  (Biederman et  al.  2008a,b).  Gualtieri  and  Johnson  (2008)  conducted  a cross-sectional  study  of  ADHD  patients  treated  with different  ADHD  drugs  (Adderall  XR,  atomoxetine, Concerta)  (Adderall  XR  is  an  extended-release  formu­ lation  with  duration  of  action  of  approximately  10-12  h. This  is  significantly  longer  than  the  duration  of  action  of most  methylphenidate  formulations,  with  the  exception  of Concerta.  Immediate-release  methylphenidate  lasts  at most  for  6  h).  Patients’  performance  on  a  computerized neurocognitive  screening  battery  was  compared  with untreated  ADHD  patients  and  normal  controls.  Signifi­ cant  differences  were  detected  between  normal  and

untreated  ADHD  patients.  Treated  patients  performed 

better  than  untreated  patients  but  remained  significantly 

impaired  compared  with  normal  subjects.  Thus,  even  after 

optimal  treatment,  neurocognitive  impairments  persisted 

in the ADHD patients.

It  has  never  been  established  that  the  cognitive  effects 

of  stimulant  drugs  are  central  to  their  therapeutic  utility. 

In  fact,  although  ADHD  medications  are  effective  for  the 

behavioral  components  of  the  disorder,  little  information 

exists  concerning  their  effects  on  cognition.  Barkley  and 

Cunningham  (1978)  summarized  17  short-term  research 

studies  ranging  from  2  weeks  to  6  months,  and  found 

stimulant  medications  produced  little  improvement  in  the 

academic  performance  of  hyperkinetic  ADHD  children. 

The  drugs  appeared  to  reduce  disruptive  behavior  rather 

than  improve  academic  performance.  Stimulant  drugs  do 

improve  the  ability  (even  without  ADHD)  to  focus  and 

pay  attention.  One  function,  which  is  reliably  improved 

by  stimulant  medications,  is  sustained  attention,  or  vigi­

lance.  Stimulants  improve  sustained,  focused  attention, 

but  “selective  attention”  and  “distractibility”  may  be 

worsened,  possibly  because  of  a  drug  induced  increase  in 

impulsivity.  Both  AMP  and  MPH  do  not  improve  (and 

may  even  impair)  short-term  acquisition  of  information. 

In  addition,  AMP  and  MPH  do  not  improve,  and  may 

impair  “cognitive  flexibility”  as  assessed  with  tests  such  as 

the  Wisconsin  Card  Sort  and  Attentional  Set-Shifting 

tasks.  MPH  has  been  shown  to  improve  performance  on 

an  auditory  arithmetic  task,  the  Paced  Auditory  Serial 

Addition  Task,  in  adults  with  ADHD  relative  to  control 

subjects  (Schweitzer  et  al.  2004).  AMP  and  MPH  might 

improve  long-term  retention  of  information,  if  the  drugs 

are  active  during  a  period  in  which  memory  is  being 

“consolidated.”  However,  this  may  only  occur  in  situa­

tions where retention is already suboptimal.

**Effects of stimulants  on cognition in** 

# **individuals without ADHD**

# Recognition  that  ADHD  persists  into  adulthood  has  sub­

stantially  increased  the  prescription  stimulant  treatment 

of  adults  with  the  disorder  (see  above).  It  has  also 

resulted  in  a  corresponding  escalation  of  nonprescription 

stimulant  use  in  many  college  students  confirmed  by 

numerous  surveys.  Studies  consistently  show  that  students 

report  using  stimulant  medications,  legally  or  illicitly,  to 

improve  academic  performance,  specifically  to  increase 

concentration  and  the  ability  to  stay  up  longer  and  study. 

Intuitively,  it  would  seem  logical  that  drugs  that  improve 

attention  and  concentration  should  also  promote  learning 

and  academic  achievement.  Inherent  in  terms  like  “cogni­

tive  enhancers,”  “smart  drugs,”  and  “neuroenhancers”  is 

the assumption that MPH and d-AMP enhance cognition.

Major  magazines  such  as The  New  Yorker  have  reported  a trend  toward  growing  use  of  prescription  stimulants  by college  students  for  “neuroenhancement”.  In  fact,  some students  are  faking  ADHD  to  gain  access  to  prescription stimulant  medication,  which  has  led  to  a  shortage  of ADHD  drugs  such  as  Adderall  (Mitchell  2012).  Unfortu­ nately,  media  reports  appear  to  condone  this  behavior  as 95%  of  articles  mentioned  at  least  one  possible  benefit  of using  prescription  drugs  for  neuroenhancement,  but  only 58% mentioned any risks or side effects (Partridge et al. 2011).  Duke  University  recently  enacted  a  new  policy  pro­ hibiting  the  nonmedical  use  of  prescription  stimulants  for any  academic  purposes  (McLaughlin  2012).  Students received  an  email  stating  policy  changes  including,  “The unauthorized  use  of  prescription  medication  to  enhance academic  performance  has  been  added  to  the  definition of  Cheating.”  In  the  past,  the  use  of  such  drugs  without  a prescription  was  only  a  violation  under  the  University’s drug  policy.  Oddly,  the  assumption  that  prescription stimulants  are  truly  “cognitive  enhancers”  is  not  really questioned.  Stimulants  reduce  hyperactivity,  impulsivity, and  inattention  in  children  and  adults  with  ADHD,  so  it has  been  assumed  that  these  drugs  enhance  long-term intellectual  performance.  However,  contrary  to  simple implicit  assumptions  found  in  bioethics  and  media  dis­ courses,  there  are  actually  only  a  few  studies  on  the enhancement  effects  of  “cognitive  enhancers”  in  individu­ als without ADHD. Smith  and  Farah  (2011)  reviewed  data  on  prescription stimulants  as  neuroenhancers  from  over  forty  laboratory studies  involving  healthy,  nonelderly  adults.  Most  of  the studies  looked  at  one  of  three  types  of  cognition:  learn­ ing,  working  memory,  and  cognitive  control.  Effects  of d-AMP  or  MPH  on  cognition  were  assessed  by  a  variety of  tasks  (Table  1).  A  typical  learning  task  asks  subjects to  memorize  a  list  of  paired  words;  an  hour,  a  few  days, or  a  week  later,  subjects  are  presented  with  the  first words  in  the  pairs  and  asked  to  come  up  with  the  sec­ ond.  In  general,  with  single  exposures  of  verbal  material, the  studies  on  learning  showed  that  no  benefits  are  seen immediately  following  learning,  but  later  recall  and  rec­ ognition  are  enhanced.  Of  the  six  articles  reporting  on memory  performance  (Rapoport  et  al.  1978;  Soetens et  al.  1993;  Camp-Bruno  and  Herting  1994;  Fleming et  al.  1995;  Unrug  et  al.  1997;  Zeeuws  and  Soetens 2007),  encompassing  eight  separate  experiments,  only one  of  the  experiments  yielded  significant  memory enhancement  on  short  delays  (Rapoport  et  al.  1978).  In contrast,  retention  was  reliably  enhanced  by  d-AMP when  subjects  were  tested  after  longer  delays,  with  recall improved  after  1  h  through  1  week  (Soetens  et  al.  1993, 1995;  Zeeuws  and  Soetens  2007).  These  data  suggest  that when  people  are  given  rote-learning  tasks  their  perfor­

mance  is  improved  by  stimulants.  The  benefits  were more  apparent  in  studies  where  subjects  had  been  asked to  remember  information  for  several  days  or  longer. However,  studies  only  found  a  correlation  with  rote memory  tasks,  not  complex  memory,  which  is  more likely to appear on college exams.

In  contrast  to  the  types  of  memory,  which  are  long lasting  and  formed  as  a  result  of  learning,  working  mem­ ory  is  a  temporary  store  of  information  that  plays  a  role in  executive  function.  Several  studies  have  assessed  the effect  of  MPH  or  d-AMP  on  tasks  examining  various aspects  of  working  memory  (Sahakian  and  Owen  1992; Oken  et  al.  1995;  Elliott  et  al.  1997;  Mehta  et  al.  2000; Barch  and  Carter  2005;  Silber  et  al.  2006;  Clatworthy et  al.  2009)  (see  Table  1).  One  classic  approach  to  the assessment  of  working  memory  is  the  span  task,  in  which a  series  of  items  is  presented  to  the  subject  for  repetition, transcription,  or  recognition.  A  spatial  span  task,  in  which the  subjects  must  retain  and  reproduce  the  order  in  which boxes  in  a  scattered  spatial  arrangement  change  color  was employed  by  Elliott  et  al.  (1997)  to  assess  the  effects  of MPH  on  working  memory.  For  the  subjects  in  the  group who  received  placebo  first,  MPH  increased  spatial  span. However,  for  the  subjects  who  received  MPH  first,  there was  a  nonsignificant  opposite  trend.  The  authors  noted that  the  subjects  in  the  first  group  performed  at  an  overall lower  level,  and  so,  this  may  have  contributed  to  the  lar­ ger  enhancement  effect  for  less  able  subjects.  Barch  and Carter  (2005)  obtained  similar  results  and  Mehta  et  al. 

(2000)  found  evidence  of  greater  accuracy  with  MPH.  In the  study  by  Mehta  et  al.  (2000),  the  effect  depended  on subjects’  working  memory  ability:  the  lower  a  subject’s score  on  placebo,  the  greater  the  improvement  on  MPH. In  contrast  to  the  three  previous  studies,  Bray  et  al. 

(2004)  reported  that  MPH  does  not  improve  the  cogni­ tive  function  of  sleep-deprived  young  adults.  In  sum,  the evidence  concerning  stimulant  effects  of  working  memory is  mixed,  with  some  findings  of  enhancement  and  some null  results,  although  no  findings  of  overall  performance impairment  (Smith  and  Farah  2011).  However,  the  small effects  were  mainly  evident  in  subjects  who  had  low cognitive  performance  to  start  with,  showing  that  the drug  is  more  effective  at  correcting  deficits  than 

“enhancing  performance.”  Farah  et  al.  (2009)  recently examined  the  effect  of  Adderall  upon  creativity,  a component  of  cognition  stimulants  are  suspected  of  sti­ fling,  in  a  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial.  They found  that  the  drug  enhanced  creativity  on  specific  tasks, but  the  amount  of  enhancement  depended  upon  the baseline  performance  of  individuals:  lower-performing individuals  were  more  enhanced  than  high-performers. Thus,  the  drugs  do  not  offer  as  much  help  to  people  with greater intellectual abilities.

The  third  type  of  cognition  is  cognitive  control.  Cogni­ tive  control  is  a  broad  concept  that  refers  to  guidance  of cognitive  processes  in  situations  where  the  most  natural, automatic,  or  available  action  is  not  necessarily  the  cor­ rect  one  (Smith  and  Farah  2011).  Attention  and  working memory  are  thought  to  rely  on  cognitive  control  and  loss of  cognitive  control  is  a  major  component  of  many  neu­ ropsychiatric  diseases  such  as  schizophrenia.  The  effects of  MPH  and  d-AMP  have  been  determined  on  several tests  used  to  study  cognitive  control,  including  the  go/nogo  task,  the  stop-signal  task,  and  the  Flanker  test.  In  gen­ eral,  the  effects  of  stimulants  on  cognitive  control  are  not

robust,  but  MPH  and  d-AMP  appear  to  enhance  cogni­

tive  control  in  some  tasks  for  some  people,  especially 

those  less  likely  to  perform  well  on  cognitive  control  tasks 

(Smith  and  Farah  2011).  The  results  of  these  studies  cur­

rently  provide  limited  support  for  the  enthusiastic  por­

trayals of cognitive enhancement.

The  neural  basis  of  error  processing  has  become  a  key 

research  interest  in  cognitive  neuroscience.  Recently,  a 

single  dose  of  MPH  was  shown  to  improve  the  ability  of 

healthy  volunteers  to  consciously  detect  performance 

errors  (Hester  et  al.  2012).  Furthermore,  this  behavioral 

effect  was  associated  with  a  strengthening  of  activation

differences  in  the  dorsal  anterior  cingulate  cortex  and inferior  parietal  lobe  during  the  MPH  condition  for errors  made  with  versus  without  awareness.  How  the brain  monitors  ongoing  behavior  for  performance  errors is  a  central  question  of  cognitive  neuroscience.  Dimin­ ished  awareness  of  performance  errors  limits  the  extent  to which  humans  engage  in  corrective  behavior  and  has  been linked to loss of insight in ADHD and drug addiction. As  it  remains  unclear  whether  stimulant  medication has  the  same  effect  on  healthy  individuals  as  for  those with  ADHD,  it  is  possible  that  many  reported  effects  of prescription  stimulants  in  healthy  individuals  may  stem from  placebo  effects.  Looby  and  Earleywine  (2011)  exam­ ined  whether  placebo  effects  influence  reports  of  subjec­ tive  mood  and  cognitive  performance  among  college students  who  endorsed  several  risk  factors  for  prescription stimulant  misuse  (e.g.,  low  grade  point  average,  fraternity/sorority  involvement,  binge  drinking).  Interestingly, participants  believed  that  they  had  better  ability  to  focus and  persevere,  particularly  for  a  sustained  amount  of time,  when  they  expected  to  receive  MPH  (Looby  and Earleywine  2011).  This  is  similar  to  circumstances  in which  participants  may  engage  in  nonmedical-stimulant use  to  study  or  cram  for  extended  hours.  On  the  other hand,  when  experimental  participants  did  not  expect  to receive  MPH,  their  attention  appeared  disrupted  resulting in  inconsistent  reaction  times  throughout  the  CPT.  Inter­ estingly,  subjective  feelings  of  being  high  and  stimulated were  produced  solely  by  expecting  to  receive  MPH.  This finding  is  important  to  consider  when  examining  initia­ tion  and  maintenance  of  nonmedical  prescription  stimu­ lant  use.  As  motives  for  nonprescription  stimulant  use include  the  desire  to  feel  high  (Barrett  et  al.  2005),  it  is likely  that  individuals  who  use  a  stimulant  for  this  pur­ pose  will  consequently  feel  high  due  to  these  demon­ strated  placebo  effects,  which  will  likely  maintain  misuse of the drug.

**Prescription stimulant misuse in** 

# **athletes** ADHD  is  a  controversial  problem  in  sport  as  participants 

# with  this  disorder  often  require  banned  stimulants  while competing.  Many  of  the  governing  bodies  of  competitive sports  have  developed  regulations  that  limit  the  use  of stimulant  medications  to  treat  ADHD.  In  other  cases, stimulant  use  is  allowed  in  the  setting  of  a  documented diagnosis  of  ADHD.  Most  sports  organizations  around the  world  now  follow  the  guidelines  set  forth  by  the World  Anti-Doping  Agency  (WADA).  According  to  this document,  the  diagnosis  of  ADHD  is  to  be  made  by “experienced  clinicians”  and  in  accordance  to  the  DSMIV.  Stimulant  medications  are  considered  to  be  a 

**10**© 2012 The Authors. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

“medical  best  practice  treatment”  that  do  require  the athlete  to  file  a  therapeutic  use  exemption  (TUE).  A  TUE gives  athletes  with  medical  diagnoses  an  exemption  to use  a  drug  normally  prohibited  by  MLB,  to  treat  a legitimately  diagnosed  medical  condition.  WADA recommends  reassessments  of  continued  treatment  every 3-4  months.  Other  organizations,  such  as  the  National College  Athletic  Association  (NCAA)  and  individual professional  leagues,  such  as  the  National  Football  League 

(NFL)  and  Major  League  Baseball  (MLB),  have  developed their own regulations.

The  NCAA  does  not  require  that  physicians  prescribe  a trial  of  nonstimulant  medications  before  prescribing  stim­ ulants,  only  that  the  prescribing  physician  considers  non­ stimulants  first.  The  NCAA  acknowledges  that nonstimulant  medication  may  not  be  as  effective  as  stim­ ulant  medications  in  treating  ADHD.  In  contrast  to  the NCAA  regulations,  athletes  who  are  also  participating  in events  governed  by  the  International  Olympic  Committee 

(IOC)  and/or  WADA  are  not  allowed  to  use  stimulant medications,  even  with  a  TUE.  These  organizations require  that  the  athlete  with  ADHD  on  stimulant  medica­ tions  stop  taking  these  medication  or  risk  disqualification 

(Putukian et al. 2011).

It  has  been  reported  that  MLB  players  are  using  an ADHD  diagnosis  to  evade  the  AMP  ban  (Associated  Press 2009).  According  to  records  MLB  officials  turned  over  to congressional  investigators  as  part  of  George  Mitchell’s probe  into  steroid  use  in  baseball,  the  number  of  players getting  “therapeutic  use  exemptions”  from  baseball’s  AMP ban  jumped  in  1  year  from  28  to  103  —  which  means  that, suddenly,  7.6%  of  the  1354  players  on  major-league  rosters have  been  diagnosed  with  ADHD.  MLB  banned  AMP  in 2006.  The  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  athletes  has  not  been studied,  although  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  it  would  dif­ fer  from  the  general  population.  Thus,  2—3  times  the  usual adult  rate  of  ADHD  in  baseball  players  is  alarming.  Ath­ letes  may  see  stimulants  as  a  way  to  help  maintain  physical fitness  for  their  competitive  sport  or  to  improve  their  con­ centration.  Certainly  some  of  the  players  getting  prescrip­ tions  for  ADHD  medications  may  have  a  legitimate medical  need  and  without  treatment,  players  manifesting the  symptoms  of  untreated  ADHD  would  be  at  a  disadvan­ tage  to  non-ADHD  players.  A  therapeutic  dose  of  MPH will  benefit  concentration,  and  may  improve  motor  coor­ dination.  Prescription  stimulants  to  treat  ADHD  could  be used  as  performance  enhancing  drugs  (PEDs);  however,  a proper  diagnosis  would  prevent  athletes  from  abusing  the TUE status to “cheat within the rules.”

Some  athletes  will  only  take  medications  episodically  for school  testing  or  for  studying  purposes.  Others  may  feel that  their  sport  performance  is  improved  on  stimulants, whereas  others  may  temporarily  stop  taking  them  so

that  their  sports  play  is  more  random  and  unfocused, which  they  feel  improves  their  performance  (Pelham  et  al. 1990).

**Potential adverse affects  of chronic** 

# **stimulant use** ADHD  is  now  recognized  as  a  chronic  disorder  that  con­

# tinues  into  adulthood;  therefore,  some  individuals  take stimulants  such  as  MPH  and  d-AMP  for  years.  The  medi­ cal  literature  provides  abundant  data  to  support  the potentially  positive  effect  of  stimulants  for  the  majority  of children,  adolescents,  and  adults  with  ADHD,  and  stimu­ lants  have  been  considered  to  be  relatively  safe  (Elia  et  al. 1999;  Brown  et  al.  2005).  However,  reports  of  adverse events  in  conjunction  with  the  use  of  these  drugs  have raised concern about their safety. Large  doses  of  stimulants  can  lead  to  psychosis,  sei­ zures,  and  cardiovascular  events.  The  induction  of  schizophrenic-like  states  in  AMP  abusers  is  well  documented, although  the  onset  of  such  states  in  children  on  pre­ scribed  doses  of  stimulant  medication  is  observed  far  less often  (Polchert  and  Morse  1985;  Masand  et  al.  1991; Murray  1998).  Surles  et  al.  (2002)  published  a  case  report of  psychotic  reactions  to  AMP  (10  mg/day)  in  an  adoles­ cent  ADHD  patient.  The  patient  displayed  many  of  the characteristics  of  AMP-induced  psychosis  including  visual hallucinations,  delusions,  anorexia,  flattening  of  affect, and  insomnia.  It  is  thought  that  the  mechanism  of  AMPinduced  psychosis  is  mediated  by  dopaminergic  excess.  As the  patient’s  symptoms  disappeared  when  taken  off  the stimulant  medication,  it  suggests  that  the  psychosis  was indeed secondary to AMP. The  most  commonly  observed  cardiovascular  effects linked  with  ADHD  stimulant  medications  include  hyper­ tension  and  tachycardia.  In  addition,  cardiomyopathy, cardiac  dysrhythmias,  and  necrotizing  vasculitis  have  been described.  In  February  2005,  the  brand  medication  Adderall  XR  (Shire  BioChem  Inc,  Quebec,  Canada)  was  with­ drawn  from  the  Canadian  market  by  Health  Canada.  Case reports  on  serious  cardiovascular  adverse  drug  reactions (ADRs),  sudden  death,  and  psychiatric  disorders  led  regu­ latory  agencies  to  warn  against  the  use  of  MPH  in  the pediatric  population  in  2006  and  2007  (European  Medi­ cines  Agency  2007).  In  2006,  warnings  were  also  linked  to atomoxetine  use  due  to  reports  of  hepatotoxicity  and suicidal  thoughts  in  children.  These  concerns  received glaring  attention  in  2006  and  led  the  US  Food  and  Drug Administration  advisory  committee  to  propose  placing  a black  box  warning  concerning  sudden  death  on psychostimulants in response to ADR reports. Adderall  use  is  associated  with  myocardial  infarction and even sudden death (Gandhi et al. 2005; Jiao et al.

<sup>© 2012 The Authors. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</sup>**<sup>11</sup>**

2009).  Gandhi  et  al.  (2005)  reported  the  case  of  a 

15-year-old  male  subject  who  suffered  a  myocardial infarction  after  taking  two  20  mg  tablets  of  Adderall.  Jiao et  al.  (2009)  reported  a  second  case  of  a  20-year-old ADHD  college  freshman  with  myocardial  infarction  after taking  two  15-mg  tablets  of  Adderall  XR.  Recently, Sylvester  and  Agarwala  (2012)  reported  another  case  of  a 

15-year-old  male  subject  who  suffered  a  myocardial infarction  after  starting  Adderall  XR.  The  patient  was otherwise  in  good  health  with  no  previous  cardiac  abnor­ malities  and  improved  with  cessation  of  medication.  The findings of the case have been disputed (Rosenthal 2012).

In  addition,  a  recent  report  by  Alsidawi  et  al.  (2011) discusses  the  case  of  a  19-year-old  female  subject  with Adderall  overdose  induced  inverted-Takotsubo  cardiomy­ opathy,  also  known  as  stress-induced  cardiomyopathy. The  patient  was  brought  to  the  emergency  department after  ingesting  30  Adderall  tablets.  She  complained  of pressure  like  chest  pain  and  shortness  of  breath.  Her  car­ diac  enzymes  were  elevated,  but  the  electrocardiogram was  unremarkable.  Echocardiography  identified  a  low ejection  fraction  of  25—35%  with  severe  hyperkinetic  apex and  akinetic  base  consistent  with  the  diagnosis  of inverted-TTC.  Her  symptoms  resolved  in  24  h.  Druginduced-Takotsubo  cardiomyopathy  has  been  previously reported  and  is  mainly  attributed  to  sympathetic  oversti­ mulation  (Amariles  2011).  In  this  case,  the  patient  over­ dosed  on  Adderall,  which  is  a  sympathomimetic  drug. The  mechanisms  for  AMP-induced  cardiac  injury  are  pos­ tulated  to  be  similar  to  those  seen  with  cocaine,  which include  coronary  spasm,  prothrombotic  state,  accelerated atherosclerosis  due  to  endothelial  injury,  and  direct  myo­ cardial  (Chen  2007).  Inappropriate  dosing  or  taking  with alcohol  increases  the  risk  of  serious  cardiovascular  side effects  like  myocardial  infarction,  even  without  underlying cardiovascular risk factors.

Unfortunately,  there  are  few  long-term  studies  (i.e., longer  than  24  months)  on  the  use  of  stimulants  for  the management  of  ADHD;  therefore,  the  precise  long-term effects  -  either  adverse  or  positive  -  remain  unknown. A  recent  study  (Vitiello  et  al.  2011)  suggests  that  the chronic  use  of  stimulant  medication  to  treat  ADHD  in children  does  not  appear  to  increase  the  risk  for  high blood  pressure  in  the  long  term,  but  it  may  have  modest effects  on  heart  rate.  The  MTA  study  found  that  stimulant medication  does  not  appear  to  increase  the  risk  for abnormal  elevations  in  blood  pressure  or  heart  rate  over  a 

10-year  period;  however,  the  effect  of  stimulants  on  heart rate  can  be  detected  even  after  years  of  use  (Vitiello  et  al. 2011).  The  effect  on  heart  rate  may  be  clinically  significant for individuals who have underlying heart conditions.

A  cohort  study  sought  to  determine  whether  use  of MPH  in  adults  is  associated  with  elevated  rates  of  serious

cardiovascular  events  compared  with  rates  in  nonusers (Schelleman  et  al.  2012).  All  new  MPH  users  with  at  least 180  days  of  prior  enrollment  were  identified.  Initiation  of MPH  was  associated  with  a  1.8-fold  increase  in  risk  of  sud­ den  death  or  ventricular  arrhythmia;  however,  the  lack  of  a dose  response  relationship  suggested  that  this  association might  not  be  a  causal  one.  A  recent  study  by  Habel  and colleagues  (Habel  et  al.  2011),  which  compared  approxi­ mately  150,000  adults  prescribed  ADHD  medication  with approximately  300,000  nonusers,  found  no  evidence  of  a link  between  ADHD  medication  and  cardiovascular  risk (myocardial  infarction,  sudden  death,  or  stroke).  Although the  student  enrolled  adults,  the  same  group  also  has reported  a  similar  lack  of  significant  association  between serious  cardiovascular  events  and  use  of  ADHD  medica­ tions  in  children  and  younger  adults  (Cooper  et  al.  2011). These  findings  support  the  final  decision  of  the  US  Food and  Drug  Administration  committee  to  not  to  place  a black  box  warning  for  all  children  and  adults,  but  to pursue  further  research.  However,  the  study  by  Habel  et  al. (2011)  has  limitations  stemming  from  its  focus  on  the most  severe  cardiovascular  event.  The  databases  were  not used  to  examine  other  cardiovascular  adverse  effects,  such as  palpitations  and  dyspnea,  which,  although  less  severe, are nonetheless alarming to patients. Additional  potential  AD  Rs  associated  with  stimulant  use are  important  to  note  including  abdominal  pain,  anorexia, constipation,  dizziness,  dry  mouth,  headache,  insomnia, jitteriness,  irritability,  nausea,  and  palpitations  (Greydanus and  Strasburger  2006).  College  students  with  ADHD  who misuse  prescribed  stimulants  also  reported  hyperactivity symptoms  as  a  common  adverse  event.  Of  particular significance  to  athletes,  many  stimulants  utilized  in  treat­ ing  ADHD  may  increase  core  temperature  (Piper  et  al. 2005),  possibly  increasing  risk  of  heart  injury.  These  agents may  also  mask  signs  and  symptoms  of  fatigue  and  allow for  a  longer  duration  of  exercise  with  elevated  temperature in  excess  of  40°C.  Thus,  in  situations  of  increased  exoge­ nous heat stress, stimulants should be used with caution.

**Conclusion** Although  prescription  stimulants  have  been  shown  to  be 

# relatively  safe  and  effective  in  managing  the  symptoms  of ADHD,  there  exists  a  significant  potential  for  misuse.  The data  are  clear  that  individuals  with  and  without  ADHD, including  athletes  misuse  stimulants  to  enhance  perfor­ mance.  Although  stimulants  may  improve  an  individual’s performance  when  given  a  rote-learning  task,  they  do  not offer  as  much  help  to  people  with  greater  intellectual  abil­ ities.  Stimulants  do  not  increase  IQ  (Advokat  et  al.  2008). In  fact,  very  little  is  known  about  the  effects  of  nonpre­ scription  stimulants  on  cognitive  enhancement  outside  of 

**12**© 2012 The Authors. Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

the  student  population,  although  it  is  frequently  reported in  newspaper  articles.  Thus,  the  rumored  effects  of  “smart drugs”  may  be  a  false  promise,  as  research  suggests  that stimulants  are  more  effective  at  correcting  deficits  than 

“enhancing  performance.”  Moreover,  students  are  taking unnecessary  risks  including  the  potential  for  harmful  side effects,  which  may  cause  sudden  death.  This  requires  edu­ cation  on  the  proper  use  of  stimulants  and  on  the  signs and  symptoms  of  misuse  and  the  health  risks  associated with  misuse.  It  is  important  that  students  with  prescription stimulants  understand  that  they  are  the  main  source  of diversion  to  other  students,  and  should  receive  education in  the  prevention  of  stimulant  diversion.  Health  centers should  aim  to  recognize  students  who  are  misusing  stimu­ lants  because  they  may  present  with  a  variety  of  signs including  insisting  on  a  larger  dose,  and  demanding  more drug  during  times  within  the  academic  year,  such  as  dur­ ing  finals.  Students  with  past  or  active  drug  abuse  patterns should  not  be  prescribed  stimulants,  as  they  are  more likely  to  divert  their  prescription  stimulants.  It  is  also important  that  athletes  be  warned  that  the  NCAA,  the  US Olympic  Committee,  and  the  IOC  ban  MPH.  As  a  result, education  on  the  proper  use  of  stimulants  and  on  the  signs and symptoms of misuse is an imperative.
