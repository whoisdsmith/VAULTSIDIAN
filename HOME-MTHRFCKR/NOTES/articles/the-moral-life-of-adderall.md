**ABSTRACT**

### THE MORAL LIFE OF ADDERALL: HEALTH, EMPOWERMENT, AND 

### RESPONSIBILITY IN THE ERA OF PHARMACEUTICALIZATION

By

Tazin Karim Daniels

My dissertation is an ethnographic exploration of how pharmaceutical morality is challenged, negotiated, and reconstructed across the social life of prescription stimulants. It is situated within the modem American university, where students are experimenting with drugs such as Adderall and Vyvanse in an attempt to improve academic performances. Sanctioned for the treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), these powerful medications require a doctor’s prescription to access legally. However, studies indicate that they are commonly circulated among peers, leading to proscribed consumption rates of up to 43% in some college populations. Existing research focuses primarily on the motivations of the illicit user and describes their pharmaceutical choices according to neoliberal logics. I build on this work by also considering the moral logics that students rely on to rationalize their controversial behaviors. Moreover, I examine how these logics are translated and absorbed as they filter through the economic, medical, and academic landscapes that circumscribe the user experience. This includes questions of safety, fairness, legality, and efficacy posed by pharmaceutical advertisers, heath service providers, and drug dealers - many of whom contribute to definitions of “responsible” stimulant use in the university setting.

Data for this project was based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted from 2012 to 2014 at a large public institution, which I refer to as “American State University.” It is centered around semi-structured interviews and participant observations with 45 undergraduates, aimed at explicating the the complex set of values and concerns that are associated with Adderall in the

college environment. I interacted with these individuals over 12 to 24 months in various capacities as they avoided, procured, distributed and consumed stimulants in public and private settings. To provide context for these student-centered experiences, I also conducted a critical discourse analysis of select direct-to-consumer (DTC) pharmaceutical marketing campaigns and interacted with medical and educational professionals on and around campus. In combination, these methods provided key insights into how discourses around responsible stimulant use were constructed and diffused by these various actors during their interactions with students.

My findings suggest that engagements with prescription stimulants have become a fundamental part of how numerous students construct themselves and are constructed by others as healthy, empowered, and responsible individuals. In particular, the flexibility of Adderall as a medication, enhancement, and recreational drug allowed both users and providers to mold its symbolic meaning into a form that would complement or enhance their moral sense of self. However, my data illustrates how flexibility can lead to instability as students struggled to make sense of the social and chemical implications they experienced during circulation and consumption. I argue that this instability triggered what Zigon (2007) describes as “moments of moral breakdown” which were based in concerns over medical non-compliance, malingering, social stigma, drug dealing, academic dishonesty, and addiction. My multi-methodological approach allowed me to document the strategies informants developed to preclude and respond to these moments of moral breakdown, and the multiple functions of Adderall within these rationales. As a result, my research provides ethnographic evidence to better understand how students manage the double-edged flexibility/instability of prescription stimulant use in order to operate unreflectively in an increasingly pharmaceuticalized environment.

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**

This dissertation would not have been possible without the support of so many individuals and institutions that I have had the honor of working with during my time at Michigan State University. First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Heather Howard, for all of her efforts in helping me complete this project. She has pushed me to think 

about my work in new and creative ways that have significantly impacted the intellectual value of this research. Through her mentorship, she has also taught me how to be a better writer and 

anthropologist, and instilled skills that will carry me far beyond this degree. I would also like to thank the rest of my committee for their continued compassion and pragmatism throughout the research and writing processes. I would like express my gratitude to Dr. Mindy Morgan, who has 

supported my work from the beginning and taught me how to maintain a critical and thoroughly 

anthropological perspective in everything I write. My dissertation has benefited greatly from Dr. Linda Hunt’s theoretical and methodological expertise and keen analytical eye. I am also grateful 

for the contributions of Dr. Christina DeJong who has been a wonderful mentor and supporter throughout my graduate career.

There are also a number of individuals from Michigan State University whose advice and guidance have made my time in graduate school incredibly fulfilling. I would like to specifically 

acknowledge Ethan Watrall, Julie Libarkin, Stephen Thomas, Gabe Ording, and Melissa McDaniels for providing me with so many opportunities to improve my scholarship. I am also in debt to the Department of Anthropology, as well as the Centers for Integrative Studies for General Sciences and Social Sciences for their support through various assistantships and 

fellowships. I am especially grateful for the contributions of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for

I would also like to thank the professional mentors who have contributed to the 

intellectual development of this dissertation and my own development as an anthropologist. I would especially like to thank Gilbert Quintero, Michael Oldani, Joseph Dumit, William 

Garriott, and Mark Nichter for helping me think through this project and navigating the exciting 

field of pharmaceutical anthropology. I am grateful for the overwhelming support and 

encouragement of my colleagues from the Alcohol, Drugs and Tobacco Study Group (ADTSG) who have pushed me to see the value of my work across academic boundaries. This includes but 

is not limited to Roland Moore, Juliet Lee, Kristen Ogilvie, Daniel Lende and Bryan Page. I am 

also grateful for the wisdom and encouragement of Eileen Anderson-Fye, Helena Hansen, Mimi Nichter, Eugene Raikhel, Anita Hardon and Todd Meyers.

This research represents the collaborative efforts and success of several dedicated undergraduate research assistants whom I have had the pleasure of mentoring over the course of this project. I am particularly indebted to the hard work and encouragement of Breanne Casper, 

Shivani Pandya, Breanne Block, Erin Mobley, Nick Flagga, Mariah Hall, Joey Podrasky,

**CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION**

Last year, I joined a cross-disciplinary writing group at my university for PhD students 

seeking accountability and support while working on their dissertations. We started the first meeting of the semester by introducing ourselves and describing our projects. When it was my turn, I began to recite my well-rehearsed academic bio: Hi everyone, my name is Taz Daniels. I am a Ph.D. student in the medical anthropology program. My research looks at how American college students use prescription stimulants like Adderall to improve their academic performance. As soon as I mentioned the word Adderall, I received an almost visceral reaction that I have become accustomed to whenever I describe my research to colleagues. Their eyes lit up, they leaned in closer, and began flooding me with questions. Wow, do students really do 

that? Is it safe? Does it really work? Can you bring some Adderall to our meeting next week? The last question was followed by an eruption of nervous laughter as if to reassure me, and perhaps more importantly, themselves that they would never expect me to actually supply the 

drug, even if it could help us through the treacherous task of writing our dissertations. There is, of course, always a little truth behind every “just kidding.”

Adderall is one of several prescription stimulants marketed to treat Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition diagnosed in approximately 2-9% of 

college students in the US (Dupaul et al. 2009). In the last decade, it has also become the drug of 

choice for undiagnosed or healthy students hoping to increase focus, manage time and improve 

academic performances. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies these medications as “Schedule IIN”: substances that carry a high potential for abuse, which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence (FDA 2007). Accordingly, they require a formal diagnosis 

and prescription from a sanctioned medical professional to be obtained legally. Possession of

Adderall without a prescription carries significant fines and the possibility of imprisonment 

(FDA 2009). Despite these medical and legal risks, studies report rates of illicit use as high as 

43% within some US college populations (Advokat et al. 2008).

My experience conducting ethnographic research on this phenomenon from 2012 to 2014 both reflected and embodied the increasing pervasiveness of this practice within a university 

setting. Since the start of this project, I have had dozens of colleagues, students, and even professors elicit advice on how to convince their doctors to prescribe them Adderall or ask if I 

could solicit the drug through one of my informants. As more and more people came clean about their desires to medically cope with the rigors of academic life, I too became acutely aware of my personal and professional shortcomings. Every pile of ungraded papers, missed dinner 

invitation, and dirty dish in my kitchen sink signaled an opportunity for stimulant use. Over time, the moral dilemmas that came with writing about a drug that could potentially help me write 

about that drug became almost unbearable. Do I give in and risk my health, safety, and freedom, 

or abstain and compromise my unrealized productivity? Although I had never used Adderall, I 

felt as though my identities as a responsible partner, student, instructor, and anthropologist were being filtered and redefined through this tiny pill.

The degree to which prescription stimulant use was simultaneously normalized, 

glamorized, and demonized within academia continued to shape my research in ways I had not 

initially anticipated. However, I eventually learned that I could use this struggle to my advantage 

and connect with my subjects as both an insider, a student also dealing with academic pressures, 

and an outsider, someone who had never used the drug. This positionality allowed me to build trust during student interviews and interactions, and to experience the complexities of this drug behavior through their distinct stories and actions. It also enabled me to move past simply

identifying self-reported motivations for Adderall use, as many studies have done before (Low et al. 2002; McCabe et al. 2006; DeSantis et al. 2008), and consider the moral nuances that shaped student experiences of seeking, circulating and consuming stimulants.

I found that, for some students, Adderall use - with or without a prescription - is never acceptable; it is a sign of weakness, evidence that you do not have what it takes to be in academia. For others, Adderall use is absolutely acceptable; it means that you understand the importance of academic success and are willing to leverage the tools available to you. For most students, however, attitudes toward prescription stimulants are not black or white, as they struggled to rationalize their pharmaceutical choices from moment to moment. My research is an ethnographic exploration of this struggle and the processes by which the boundaries between responsible and irresponsible Adderall use are constructed, contested, destabilized, and re­ assembled as part of the modem US college experience. Using stimulants as a case study, I also contribute to an anthropological understanding of pharmaceutical morality, and what it means to be a principled and productive student in an increasingly pharmaceuticalized environment.

### **1.1  PHARMACEUTICAL MORALITY**

My research sets out to explore the expansive influence of prescription stimulants on moral subjectivities and experiences within the setting of the modem American university. It builds on over a decade of anthropological and sociological work investigating the pervasive process of pharmaceuticalization, in which transformations in health, identity, agency, and social relationships are understood in relation to pharmaceutical use (White 2002; Dumit and Greenslit 2006; Biehl 2007; Williams et al. 2009; Abraham 2010). I argue that an ethnographic study of prescription stimulants is a particularly productive site for exploring pharmaceuticalization

because they intersect multiple domains of American society as commodities, medications, illicit drugs, and performance enhancers. Using a combination of interview and observational methods, I set out to investigate the various cultural ideologies, relationships, subjectivities, and experiences that are produced, mediated, and transformed by these drugs in their multiple capacities.

Throughout this dissertation, I use the term pharmaceutical morality to refer to the explicitly moral dimensions of pharmaceuticalization, as well as the influence of this process on conceptions of morality within the US. I argue that focusing on the moral dilemmas associated with access to, and interactions with, prescription stimulants can offer dialectical insights into the increasingly intimate link between morality and pharmaceuticalization in American culture. My exploration of pharmaceutical morality is guided by two underlying questions: how does morality play a role in shaping pharmaceutical subjects, and how do pharmaceuticals play a role in shaping moral subjects? To address these questions, my research links together anthropological theories of morality, as well as literature that both explicitly and implicitly address the moralized nature of prescription drugs and pharmaceutical practices in the US.

**1.1.1  Anthropology of Morality**

Existing studies from the health and social sciences that examine illicit stimulant use among US college students have largely, and implicitly, described this phenomenon according to neoliberal logics. Specifically, Adderall use has been presented as a conscious, reflexive, and intentional exercise of neoliberal agency aimed at meeting a predefined goal of enhancing academic performance. According to Gershon (2011:539), neoliberal agency is “produced by consciously using a means-ends calculus that balances alliances, responsibility and risk.” She 

4

explains,

A neoliberal perspective presumes that every social analyst on the ground should ideally 

use market rationality to interpret their social relationships and social strategies. This 

concept of agency requires a reflexive stance in which people are subjects for 

themselves—a collection of processes to be managed. There is always already a 

presumed distance to oneself as an actor. One is never ‘in the moment’; rather, one is 

always faced with one’s self as a project that must be consciously steered through various 

possible alliances and obstacles (539).

In this view, the primary motivation behind pharmaceutical decisions, including the decision to use Adderall, is conscious and intentional self-improvement. These decisions are premeditated, 

calculated, and part of a larger ongoing project of reflexively managing oneself as a set of processes or skills.

Studies from the social sciences regularly take this type of neoliberal approach to 

explaining illicit Adderall use, situating it within broader trends in American culture. For 

example, Loe (2006:3) presents this drug behavior as part of an ongoing cultural “body project” where “students manage the various pressures of college through the use of psychostimulants, by 

literally constructing medically-disciplined bodies” (2). She defines these as “bodies that are believed to be more focused, and thus closer to the ideal social construction of a college student” 

(2). Loe argues that “the self-medicating student body makes sense in the context of a culture that promotes medicine as a tool for the construction of an idealized body, and performance as a marker of success” (17). Levinson and McKinney (2013) take a similar approach, suggesting that Adderall use emerged as a logical response to “psy culture” and the implementation in higher 

education of neoliberal management strategies, which place emphasis on efficiency and 

outcomes in a corporate university. They use the concept of “psy culture” to refer to the 

increased focus on self-improvement via psychiatric drugs and services available on college 

campuses. Accordingly, Adderall use is presented as a normalized form of neoliberal agency that 

5

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_17_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_17_7.png)

is both encouraged and facilitated by changes in the modem university environment.

Studies from the neurological sciences also regularly adopt an implicit neoliberal perspective in their analysis of illicit stimulant use. For example, Muller and Schumann (2011) present a neurobiological framework theory to explain the value of drugs like Adderall among US college students. They suggest that, historically, illicit drug use has been regarded by neurobiologists as a maladaptation, especially in populations prone to addiction because of 

genetic and environmental factors. They suggest that instead, “the large majority of non-addicted humans who consume psychoactive drugs as a normal part of their lives take drugs because the 

drugs’ effects are useful for their personal goals” (295). They call this phenomenon “drug 

instrumentalization” and describe it as a behavioral process in which individuals seek out and 

consume psychoactive drugs to achieve a state of mind that allows for better performance. They 

explain the prevalence of this behavior as a “functional adaptation to modem environments” that 

encourages goal achievement through modified consummatory behaviors (293). Ultimately, dmg 

instrumentalization theory supports the notion that even as neurobiological beings, humans are now operating under neoliberal logics in which the strategic consumption of stimulants serves a productive and adaptive function.

While these studies offer important insights into the potential motivations of US college 

students who engage in illicit Adderall use, the neoliberal approach can also be limiting. Gershon 

(2011:537) argues that “neoliberal agency creates relationships that are morally lacking and 

overlooks differences in scale—deficiencies that an anthropological imagination would be able to critique effectively.” She goes on to explain that “anthropologists have found that their 

interlocutors on the ground often talk about epistemological differences in terms of morality, that 

discussing what is moral has become a means for evaluating the new forms of social 

6

###### Page 18

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_18_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_18_7.png)

relationships people are constantly encountering” (546). This is particularly true in the case of 

stimulants, where students might enter into new exchanges with the pharmaceutical industry, health service providers, and drug dealers in order to gain access. Thus, while existing studies 

often explain Adderall use according to conscious, reflexive, and calculated neoliberal logics, my research also takes into consideration the range of subconscious, non-reflexive, and responsive moral logics that can also facilitate pharmaceutical choice.

In this dissertation, I examine the circulation and consumption of Adderall as a set of 

complex moral experiences that occur across multiple medical, social and academic domains. 

Kleinman (1999) explains that “moral experience is about local processes (collective, 

interpersonal, subjective) that realize (enact) values in ordinary living. These processes cross the boundary of the body-self, connecting affect and cognition with cultural meaning, moral norms 

and collective identity with sense of self’ (73-74). I subscribe to his definition of experience as 

fundamentally intersubjective and as involving a flow of communications, practices, and negotiations that are embodied with social meanings. With this in mind, I set out to identify those 

experiences in which students expressed themselves as moral subjects through their interactions with other each other, with drug providers, and with prescription stimulants.

Zigon (2007) notes that one of the primary challenges to studying morality

anthropologically is being able to distinguish moral experience from other cultural experiences 

of daily life. He explains, “morality can best be analytically thought of as those bodily 

dispositions enacted in the world non-intentionally and unreflectively” (135). Zigon describes these dispositions as familiar and shared with others in a social group, and thus hard to 

distinguish from what anthropologists usually describe as embodied culture, tradition, and power. As a result, he argues that studying these dispositions alone cannot constitute a proper 

7

###### Page 19

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_19_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_19_7.png)

anthropology of moralities. Alternatively, Zigon suggests,

An anthropology of moralities should be limited to what I have called moral breakdowns. 

That is, it should be limited to those social and personal moments when persons or groups 

of persons are forced to step away from their unreflective everydayness and think 

through, figure out, work on themselves and respond to certain ethical dilemmas, troubles 

or problems. These moral breakdowns are characterized by an ethical demand placed on 

the person or persons experiencing the breakdown, and this demand requires that they 

find a way or ways to “Keep Going!” and return to the everydayness of the unreflective 

moral dispositions (140). I use Zigon's (2007) framework and identify moments that trigger moral breakdowns or ethical dilemmas within the context of prescription stimulant use among US college students. These include social moments, such as key historical events or recurring debates over the ethics of prescription stimulant use that are publicized through academic and popular media outlets. These also include personal moments experienced by students who consume Adderall while also dealing with the pressures of improving academic performance, avoiding drug dependency, treating mental illness, preserving academic integrity, and maintaining social relationships. While these pressures can be ongoing, I focus on specific moments in which students, because of their experiences with stimulants, are pulled out of their state of unreflective everydayness and 

forced to consider their moral position.

It is important to note that I do not take neoliberal logics and moral logics to be in direct 

opposition or mutually exclusive. Rather, I suggest that neoliberal logics are one of many logics that students draw upon, and should be investigated as such. By examining experiences with Adderall through a broader moral lens, I am open to considering these other logics that facilitate 

stimulant use among college students and return these individuals to an unreflective moral state. My consideration of other logics includes documenting whether or not students believe the pharmaceutical practice in question is safe, legal, ethical, and/or productive, and how they draw on this belief to understand and rationalize their potentially controversial behaviors. Doing so

offers a more comprehensive understanding of how students incorporate neoliberal ideals into larger moral orientations that give meaning to their interactions with prescription stimulants.

**1.1.2  Anthropology of Pharmaceuticals**

As an intellectual and ethnographic project, pharmaceutical anthropology has evolved 

from studying prescription drugs as objects that reflect cultural values and ideologies, to objects that can transform them (Nichter and Vuckovic 1994). For example, in their classic piece “The

Charm of Medicines: Metaphors and Metonyms,” Geest and Whyte (1989) describe how the materiality or “thingness” of pills make them so powerful. They explain that medicines are “widely believed to contain the power of healing in themselves” and that “anyone who gains 

access to them can apply their power” with or without the assistance of a medical professional

(346). While this perceived, self-contained power can be liberating, Whyte et al. (2002) argue that it can also be constraining. They explain,

Medicines are empowering in that they offer users a means of control. In making this 

assertion, we place medicines within the lifeworlds of situated actors. But we must 

distinguish between control in the short term, and longer-term consequences of using 

medicines to deal with problems. Control may lead to being controlled. Drug dependence 

is the most obvious form of subjection. Social scientists point to others as well. Defining 

a problematic situation as transactable through medicines may eventually increase the 

control of medical professionals and ideology—a process called medicalization. This 

may leave people feeling dependent on doctors and drugs to understand and deal with 

their problems (15). These questions of agency versus dependency are central to the study of stimulants as both 

chemical and cultural objects. As medicines, they embody the power to quickly and effectively manage the symptoms of ADHD and foster academic success. At the same time, they are known to carry a high potential for addiction and are linked to a contentious history of medicalization in postwar America (Conrad 1975, Conrad 2005).

Abraham (2010) highlights the double-edged nature of prescription drugs in his description of pharmaceuticalization. He argues that the incorporation of pharmaceuticals into daily American life has resulted in a dichotomy between access-oriented collaboration with, and injury-oriented adversity to the pharmaceutical-industrial complex. Patient advocacy groups such as Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD) are an example of access-oriented consumers that Abraham argues bolsters the process of pharmaceuticalization. He also also notes that lawsuits, such as those periodically filed against prescription stimulant manufacturers over the last forty years, have acted to raise public doubts about the safety of these medications. Abraham argues that in some instances, these concerns act to reduce the prevalence of prescription drug use, a process he refers to as “de-pharmaceuticalization.” Under this bifurcated framework, pharmaceutical choice becomes an exercise of moral agency in which 

some consumers embrace pharmaceuticalization as a means to social and personal

empowerment, whereas others condemn it, opt out of it, and in some cases, reverse it.

In contrast, Dumit and Greenslit (2006), do not see participation in processes of pharmaceuticalization as a choice. Instead, they describe it as “a form of lifeworld colonization or medicalization from some perspectives in which core metaphors of identity, health, illness, life, longevity, and relationships are mutated” (127). They claim that under pharmaceuticalization, dependency on prescription drugs has become the new normal, where “questions of identity, control, and risk are simply no longer formulated as choices for or against 

drugs in general, but are, rather, always questions of which drugs and in what combinations” 

(130). Accordingly, they propose that Americans have incorporated the act of consuming prescription drugs into their own moral sense of self. They articulate this as “ethical identity management” and assert that “Americans are constantly asking themselves if they are doing the 

10

###### Page 22

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_22_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_22_7.png)

right things in order to be the good people they want to be, and they answer those questions with reference to how they ‘choose’ to manage their drugs” (130).

In many ways, Dumit and Greenslit’s (2006) portrayal of an all-encompassing pharmaceuticalization embodies what Zigon (2007) refers to as an unreflective moral state - one where Americans reach for prescription drugs to solve social problems without really 

questioning it. They argue that the only reflection involved is in choosing the right brand and 

dosage to meet their individual needs. While Dumit and Greenslit’s view on pharmaceutical 

choice is cannot be applied in every situation, it does speak to larger trends in US culture where the marketing, prescription and consumption of prescription stimulants have in many ways, become unreflective, normalized occurrences of daily life. This view of pharmaceuticalization 

also produces a particular type of pharmaceutical subject - one who consumes stimulants 

strategically and without moral question. This conception is in contrast to Abraham’s (2010) pharmaceutical subject who has a conscious choice to embrace or reject pharmaceuticalization through their public and private interactions with prescription drugs.

In this dissertation, I consider both Abraham (2010) and Dumit and Greenslits’ (2006) 

descriptions of pharmaceuticalization in my study of US college students who consume prescription stimulants. I am particularly interested in how students view Adderall use as an unreflective moral choice, or one that triggers and/or results from a personal moment of moral breakdown. Zigon (2007:144) notes that during moments of moral breakdown “it may be tempting to act in ways that might be considered immoral by others or by oneself’ (144). Thus, I 

am interested in documenting how students articulate and rationalize their temptations to seek 

out, circulate, or consume Adderall. These responses are key to understanding how students return to an unreflective moral state after a moment of breakdown and are able to continue

functioning as moral subjects within a pharmaceuticalized environment.

One of the key objectives in this study is to investigate the range of pharmaceutical 

experiences that shape moral subjectivities, and situate these experiences within broader forces 

of pharmaceuticalization in the university setting. This is particularly challenging given the 

dynamic function of stimulants and their ability to traverse social, medical and academic worlds. 

I deal with this complexity by systematically mapping constructions of pharmaceutical morality 

as three interconnected parts across contexts: practices, objects, and subjects.

First, I examine the multiple relationships and practices beyond consumption that can produce pharmaceutical subjects, including marketing, treatment, and circulation. While 

consumption is by far the most intimate form of subjective self-fashioning, these preceding practices are central to the extensive process of pharmaceuticalization. By investigating what 

constitutes moral drug marketing, treatment, and circulation practices, I also shed light on the role that advertisers, ADHD experts, and even drug dealers play in shaping the responsible Adderall user within the college environment. Specifically, I consider how moral experiences of participating in direct-to-consumer (DTC) drug marketing, getting tested or accommodated for ADHD, and buying/selling prescription stimulants can also trigger personal moments of moral breakdown. I am especially interested in understanding why these practices might trigger moral breakdowns for some individuals but not for others. In the cases where they do, I set out to 

document the strategies individuals deploy to respond to these breakdowns and return to an unreflective moral state.

Second, I identify the fluid symbolic meaning of Adderall within and across these 

contexts, and highlight their capacity to produce and mediate the moral subjectivities of both their providers and users. I directly address questions of agency and dependency to consider how 

12

advertisers, ADHD experts and drug dealers attempt to mold the function of stimulants to manage relationships with US college students. I also consider how users themselves 

strategically assign meaning to Adderall as a way to prevent or respond to moments of moral breakdowns that result from participating in potentially immoral behaviors. By questioning the assumption that individuals can simply apply the power of stimulants to meet predefined goals of improving health and performance, my research offers an opportunity to consider the moral dilemmas that come with facilitating or denying access to stimulants. In other words, I consider how drugs, through the process of pharmaceuticalization, can dialectically redefine the 

expectations and experiences of being a moral subject.

Third, I expand on the types of moral subjectivities that are produced through the process of pharmaceuticalization. A student who takes Adderall can be at different moments a consumer, a patient, a drug dealer, a drug seeker or a drug user. Each subjectivity represents a variable 

combination of social contexts, relationships, practices, and value systems. They can also entail a diverse set of moral considerations and breakdowns, each stemming from an increased availability of prescription stimulants in the college environment. My research examines how these experiences are negotiated in relation to other stakeholders and to the drugs themselves, 

and thus offers a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to be a moral pharmaceutical subject operating these contexts.

**1.1.3  Moral Frameworks**

In their classic piece “American Cultural Values,” Arsenberg, Conrad and Niehoff 

(1975:367) assert that the dominant means of organizing thought in American life is through “two-fold judgments based on principle.” They argue that this tradition of looking at the world in 

13

###### Page 25

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_25_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_25_7.png)

absolute terms also tends to conflate these dichotomies with an overarching ideology of goodness versus badness - a process they call “moralizing.” Taking this into consideration, I look how pharmaceuticals, and specifically prescription stimulants, have been moralized as good or bad through various cultural structures and processes. I build on the work of anthropologists who have engaged with a number of categorical frameworks, many of which emerged from prominent scientific and political discourses. The construction and stability of these frameworks are important to consider because they embody key assumptions and values around the appropriate use of prescription drugs in American culture.

In the following sections, I provide an overview of how some anthropologists have adopted and/or critiqued these frameworks and highlight the moral logics these frameworks are tied to. I have organized them into the follows classifications which align with my systematic study of pharmaceutical morality in the university setting: (1) moral drugs—those that focus on the moralized qualities of the drugs themselves; (2) moral drug users—those that draw distinctions based on the moralized intentions of the user; and (3) moral drug practices—those that also explicitly consider the moralized cultural context of the drug behavior. I then offer my own critique on the limitations of these frameworks in capturing the moral complexities of Adderall use among US college students.

1.1.3.1 Moral Drugs

In her article “The Pharmaceutical Person,” Martin (2006:274) uses the Greek term Pharmakon to describe the simultaneously productive and destructive public messages that surround pharmaceuticals in the US. She explains that “in the American Pharmakon, pills are split into good and bad parts” where the “the positive meaning sits uneasily with—and is 

14


---

###### Page 26

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_26_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_26_7.png)

shadowed by—the negative meaning.” Through ethnographic examples, Martin illustrates how the dangerous parts of an object are removed from direct view through “social processes of 

displacement” such as strategic drug marketing or the differentiation between intended and unintended side effects (247). She argues that this how Americans are able to “keep ambivalence 

about drugs at bay enough to take them in the massive amounts” despite the fact that they are 

“bad objects” (247).

Etkin (1995) also considers the complexity of “side effects” and examines the scientific 

and political processes by which post-consumption symptoms are explained through biomedical paradigms of physiology and addiction. She explains that for a pharmaceutical to qualify as a biomedical treatment, “there must be a primary effect to which all others are subordinated” 

(100). This distinction between primary effects and side effects must be made in order to move a pharmaceutical from the experimental phase to the marketing phase. At the same time, Etkin 

illustrates the instability of this dichotomy, as consumers get lost in the distinctions between 

intended side effects, unintended side effects, negative primary effects, contraindications, 

allergic reactions, hypersensitivity, and differential drug metabolism. As a result, the negative 

and positive qualities of a drug remain in flux as they are filtered and assigned meaning through these complex political, scientific, and capitalist processes.

1.1.3.2 Moral Drug Users

The motivations of drug users have also become an important factor in articulating the moral trade-offs associated with prescription drugs use in the US. A common categorical 

framework for conceptualizing these motives is the distinction made between medical versus nonmedical drug users. Experts use this dichotomy to classify users into two categories—those 

15

###### Page 27

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_27_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_27_7.png)

who follow a protocol set forth by a medical doctor and those who deviate from, or completely 

circumvent, that protocol. For example, in their study of prescription drug use among high 

school students, McCabe et al. (2007) assessed nonmedical use by asking the following: 

“Sometimes people use prescription drugs that were meant for other people, even when their 

own health professional (e.g., doctor, dentist, nurse) has not prescribed it for them. On how many 

occasions in your lifetime have you used the following types of drugs, not prescribed to you?”

Here, although moral intention may play a role, the distinction is made in service of assessing whether or not actual consumption behavior matches the written prescription.

Another common language framework, used by both experts and the general public, is the trichotomy of “drug use/misuse/abuse.” This framework embodies a moral hierarchy by 

attempting to label a prescription drug user’s intention to comply with the intended medical protocol. In an interview posted on the FDA website, Michael Klein, staff director of the

Substance Control division, offers some examples:

Let’s say that a person knows that he will get a pleasant or euphoric feeling by taking the 

drug, especially at higher doses than prescribed. That is an example of drug abuse 

because the person is specifically looking for that euphoric response. In contrast, if a 

person isn’t able to fall asleep after taking a single sleeping pill, they may take another 

pill an hour later, thinking, “That will do the job.” Or a person may offer his headache 

medication to a friend who is in pain. Those are examples of drug misuse because, even 

though these people did not follow medical instructions, they were not looking to “get 

high” from the drugs. They were treating themselves, but not according to the directions 

of their health care providers (FDA 2010).

In this framework, a person who follows the protocol set by their doctor is engaging in good drug use. Bad drug use behaviors are so labeled when a user either has moral intentions and breaks the protocol (misuse), or when a user has immoral intentions within or outside the boundaries of the protocol (abuse). This framework assumes that the abuser is more concerned with experiencing the side effects of the drug than the primary effect that is intended to treat their medical condition 

16

###### Page 28

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_28_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_28_7.png)

- and that they can tell the difference between these two intentions.

Although this framework is widely recognized by medical professionals and law enforcement, the stability of this trichotomy both within and outside of expert discourse is questionable. For example, Quintero (2012) provides a number of examples in which both scientific studies and medical reports inappropriately conflate all nonmedical prescription drug behaviors as “drug abuse.” He explains,

All forms of non-medical use, misuse and abuse become indistinguishable by being 

reduced to two essential features—they are all uses that are not explicitly medically 

sanctioned and which are consciously directed at achieving pleasure. This conflation is 

operationalized in a manner that is familiar to any student of critical analyses of drug 

representations in the media (504). Quintero suggests that in comparison, prescription drug users do not see their behaviors as logically or morally equivalent to the use of other illicit hard drugs, or see themselves as drug abusers, because their primary motivation is not to get high. In fact, many of the young adults in his study considered their illicit prescription drug use to be a form of harmless self-medication, or saw it as having some other productive function. Thus, while the drug use/misuse/abuse framework is intended to address some of these nuances, the inconsistencies in its definitions and appropriations into popular discourse illustrate its limitations.

1.1.3.3  Moral Drug Practices

Perhaps the most common categorical framework, one that is used by both experts and the public to assign some sort of generalized morality to prescription stimulant use, is that of medication/enhancement/recreation (Nichter and Quinter 2011). These categories serve to distinguish between good and bad drug behaviors and correlate closely with the level of perceived regulation in the drugs’ production, circulation, and use. Accordingly, medication is 

17


---

###### Page 29

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_29_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_29_7.png)

regarded as the most ethical form of drug use; enhancement comes in as a controversial second; 

and recreation is a distant third. At the same time, these categories also serve a necessary 

function for the range of individual and institutional stakeholders responsible for the production 

and regulation of these powerful substances. These stakeholders include drug companies, 

government agencies, medical professionals, insurance companies, lawmakers and law 

enforcement, educators, parents, and even users themselves. The trichotomy of medication/enhancement/recreation offers a common, yet flexible language that can be used to promote or condemn pharmaceutical practices that are perceived to negatively or positively 

affect individuals or society at large.

Despite the seeming practicality of this framework, distinctions between categories are based on multiple and often conflicting moral logics. This includes inconsistent assessments of whether given practices are safe, legal, ethical, and/or productive. Stakeholders assign different meanings and values to these logics. As a result, determining how a drug behavior should be 

classified can lead to contention within and among groups. At the core of these conflicts is the 

question of jurisdiction. In other words, whose responsibility is it to ensure that only the “good” 

drugs are being produced, only the “good” users gain access, and only the “good” behaviors are being sanctioned?

Recently, these questions have come to the forefront of many debates, especially as 

certain drugs are publicly crossing the boundaries between medication/enhancement/recreation. 

Marijuana, which has long been labeled as a recreational drug heavily regulated by law 

enforcement has recently been approved for medical purposes in several US states (Cerda et al. 

2012). Similarly, scientists are studying psychedelics like LSD or ayahuasca to determine whether or not they could have cognitive-enhancement effects that could treat mental illness 

18

(Anderson 2012). There are also medications like human growth hormone (HGH) and steroids, that are commonly used for performance enhancement in professional sports (Sjoqvist et al. 2008). Prescription painkillers like OxyContin, which are known to have addictive properties, are often misused and/or abused by patients and by third-party buyers on the black market (Hansen and Skinner 2012). Despite the moral ambiguities of these examples, they are framed in public discourse as clear and intentional repurposing of drugs or practices from one category to another: from medication to enhancement, from recreation to medication, etc. These superficial distinctions allow the public to more easily pass absolute moral judgments on whether they believe that drugs’ shifts between classifications can serve the greater good of society.

1.1.3.4  Incidental Slippages or Unstable Boundaries?

According to Singer and Page (2013:13), the media regularly describes emergent issues around drugs and drug use in terms of “moral panics,” which commonly entail “exaggerated and distorted portrayals of the drugs as having harmful effects, and growing emphasis on the threat to society.” They argue that “in this way, drugs are invested with the symbolic power to instigate popular moral indignation while overtly or covertly indicating the need for greater social control to protect society from the emergent danger” (13). In contrast, the illicit use of prescription stimulants among college students is a phenomenon that has, for many reasons, been portrayed in a more morally neutral tone. Media reports often use innocuous terms such as “study aids,” “brain boosters,” or “candy for college students” for Adderall, which effectively downplays the significant medical and moral implications of its illicit use. Similarly, scholars have described the behavior as “casual misuse” (Gomes et al. 2011) or “pharming” (Kadison 2005) of “biomedical instruments” (Mueller and Schulman 2011) made available as a result of 

19

###### Page 31

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_31_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_31_7.png)

“pharmaceutical leakage” (Vrecko 2015) through “gray markets” (Loe 2006). Thus, illicit Adderall use does not appear to be a clear, intentional, or morally charged move between boundaries, but rather a series of relatively harmless, incidental “slippage[s] between [boundaries 

of] enhancement, recreation and self-medication” (Nichter & Quintero 2011).

I propose that these socially and academically constructed boundaries fail to capture the range of conflated and often contradictory moral logics that individuals draw on to evaluate and rationalize prescription stimulant use. As medications, stimulants are considered to be necessary treatments to manage the detrimental symptoms of ADHD (Antshel et al. 2011); at the same time, they are demonized as habit-forming, often-ineffective drugs that carry side effects ranging 

from heart attacks to psychosis (Ross 2006). As cognitive enhancers, they are praised as the next 

logical step toward human evolution and the embodiment of the American Dream (Smith and 

Farrah 2011); at the same time, they are condemned as form of cheating, whose normalization will eventually lead to social coercion to consume these drugs in order to remain competitive in various fields of professional life (Goodman 2012). As recreational substances, individuals turn to stimulants to gain the motivation needed complete the unpleasant yet noble pursuits of 

studying, cleaning, exercising, or losing weight (Jeffers et al. 2013); at the same time, they are 

disparaged as addictive substances that get people high, promote co-consumption of alcohol and 

other drugs, and cause users to lose the willpower to complete tasks on their own volition (Low 

et al. 2002).

1.1.3.5  Responsible Drug Use

In this dissertation, I highlight the inherent instabilities of existing moral categorical 

frameworks used to describe Adderall use and unpack the complex value systems these terms 

20

###### Page 32

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_32_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_32_7.png)

embody with in the context of the modem college experience. I do this by examining how individuals define and distinguish between responsible and irresponsible Adderall use as a result of and in response to moments of moral breakdown. Responsible drug use is a concept used 

among drug scholars to describe drug use that maximizes the drug’s benefits while reducing its risk of negative impact on the lives of the user and others around him (Rodes et al. 2009). In general, attitudes around responsible drug use fall along two lines. Some believe that all recreational or illicit drug use is irresponsible because of their potential for addiction and the other social and medical side effects - thus, all non-medical use should be actively avoided or prevented (Hathaway 2001). Others suggest that drug use is an activity that can be 

simultaneously beneficial and risky; these scholars argue that, like alcohol use, sexual activity, or driving a car, drug use can reduce the damage incurred by using common sense (Moore et al. 2003). I adopt the latter position in considering attitudes toward Adderall use, because it does not 

adhere to a unified criterion and leaves open for analysis the ways in which students grapple with the double-edged nature of these drugs.

In this study, I consider how the rhetoric of responsibility emerges in response to social or personal moments of moral breakdown or ethical dilemmas experienced by my informants. These moments are always situated in larger cultural trends and debates around the safety, legality, ethics, and efficacy of Adderall use in various contexts. My research is an exploration of how individuals mobilize discourses of responsibility to express their moralized interactions with 

each other and with prescription stimulants in relation to these concerns. Specifically, I ask, how 

are responsible drugs, drug users, and drug practices redefined by individuals in response to moments of moral breakdown? I answer this question by offering insights on the heterogeneous 

experiences of US college students, and contextualizing these experiences across a network of

actors and institutions that contribute to a moral understanding of this drug behavior. In the remainder of this chapter, I describe in detail the methodological approach I used to meet my objectives and map experiences of pharmaceutical morality within the university setting.

### **1.2  THE MORAL LIFE OF ADDERALL**

The original intention of this project was to explore the dynamic cultural power of Adderall by documenting the moral experiences of US college students as they sought out, circulated, and consumed the drug. I wanted to know what it was about these small objects and how they moved through the university landscape that enabled them to be so powerful and so contentious. In order to systematically map the moral complexity of Adderall, I based my data collection and organization strategy around Geest, Whyte and Hardon’s (1996) biographical approach to studying pharmaceuticals. They propose that pharmaceuticals flow through a life cycle where “each phase has its own particular context, actors, and transactions and is characterized by different sets of values and ideas” (153). While they offer generalized descriptions of these stages that fit most pharmaceutical markets, I looked specifically at the social life of prescription stimulants within the modem university setting across four contexts: marketing, treatment, circulation, and consumption. **Figure 1.

I examined the drug behaviors or transactions (practices), the perceived function of the 

drug (objects), and the actors involved (subjects) within and across each of these contexts. My 

initial approach was to focus on consumption, but to also consider students’ self-reported 

experiences within the peripheral landscapes of marketing, treatment, and circulation. However, 

as I began my data collection, I was presented with opportunities to interact with individuals who were directly involved in these practices. This included interactions advertisers, medical and 

educational experts, university administrators, parents and peers. I also began to consider the various moral breakdowns these individuals experienced while facilitating and denying access to prescription stimulants. Although this was not the focus of my study, I also documented how these individuals drew on various moral logics to make their own pharmaceutical decisions and 

contributed to public and private definitions of responsible Adderall use.

Over the course of the project, I added several critical layers of data collection that allowed me to capture these moments of moral breakdown within and across Adderall’s social life. Ultimately, I ended up working backwards from investigating consumption to circulation to treatment and, finally, marketing. This provided insights into how moral discourses around Adderall use were constructed, filtered, and translated across these various contexts. The 

following sections provide an overview of the layers of my data collection and analytical methods for each stage of Adderall’s social life. I include more specific details about these methods and my experience conducting the research in the corresponding data chapters of this 

dissertation. Table 1 provides an overview of this data collection and organization strategy.

Accordingly, the data collection 

and data management for this project followed protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), which included the use of verbal consent as well as the de-identification of all data related to this project during the collection and analysis phases.

cultural dimensions of this drug behavior, which is by no means exclusive to my field site and is at its core an American phenomenon. At the same time, it is important to note that Adderall use is not a homogenous experience for all US college students who choose to either resist or participate in this drug behavior. Thus, the goal of this dissertation is not to provide a representative overview of illicit Adderall use on college campuses. Rather, I set out to document and contextualize individual experiences facilitating, preventing, resisting, and participating in this controversial drug behavior within broader socio-cultural trends in the US.

1.2.1.1  Semi-structured Interviews with Students

I conducted interviews with a purposive sample of forty-five undergraduates enrolled at American State University. The purpose of these interviews was to solicit narratives from students that would highlight the moral logics that surrounded their pharmaceutical practices. My intention was not to collect from a representative sample, but to interview students who specifically had experiences resisting, avoiding or participating in Adderall use. Informants were initially identified through qualitative sampling, which aims to capture a broad range of major cultural characteristics that are present in a particular social group (Becker 1996). Qualitative sampling assumes that a carefully selected set of individuals within a culture can collectively provide the major core beliefs, knowledge, and information that exist in a larger cultural group (Trotter et al. 2001). One way to gain access to well-informed individuals or information-rich cases for in-depth study is through purposive sampling (Johnson 1990). Research on special or hidden populations, such as drug users, often relies on this type of sampling (Quintero 2006). In order to participate in interviews, each potential participant needed to (1) be an undergraduate, (2) be enrolled full-time at American State University, and (3) have some prior knowledge or

experience with prescription stimulants. Initially, a total of eight participants were recruited through undergraduate research assistants who had connections to students who fit the selection 

criteria. This intentionally included four females and four males with a range of academic 

standings and backgrounds, who had varying levels of knowledge and experience with prescription stimulants. I did not specify any criteria for ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Using undergraduate research assistants to recruit these initial participants allowed me to establish a 

level of trust before the interview took place, which I then built on to recruit additional subjects through convenience snowball sampling.

Within a week of each interview, the eight original participants put me in contact with 

acquaintances who would be willing to participate in the interview process. In many cases, these new participants had either bought or sold Adderall from the initial participant, or was someone within their social group who intentionally resisted or avoided Adderall use. In total, I made

However, three of those students were unable to make it to the interview location due to a range of circumstances, and thus are not included in the sample. Table 2 represents selected characteristics of the final forty-five participants during the interview phase, and Table 3 breaks down these characteristics by use type.

According to a recent large-scale survey about illicit Adderall use, which surveyed 2,281 

students at a similarly sized university, the demographics of my participants were relatively representative (Vo et al. 2015). They reported that the majority of students who used Adderall without a prescription were white (89%), male (68%) upperclassman (80%) without any 

significant differences in academic majors. Comparatively, my sample represented an even 

27

###### Page 39

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_39_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_39_7.png)

number of males and females, who were also 89% white, with a fairly even distribution between 

STEM and non-STEM majors. Although this exact distribution was not intentional, it allowed 

access to a variety of experiences across genders and academic majors. Sixty percent of students 

in my sample were upperclassmen, which was expected given that the likelihood of being 

exposed to illicit Adderall use increases with undergraduate class standing (DeSantis 2010). Although socioeconomic status (SES) could have provided a key element in contextualizing drug behaviors, data on SES was not formally collected during the interview and thus was not presented in the table. However, the perceived association between SES and drug behaviors was 

included in the interview protocol and analyzed accordingly.

Audio-recorded interviews took place in a private location on campus and lasted between two and four hours. Following IRB-approved protocols, individuals were informed about the potential risks involved with participating in this project, including the discussion of illegal, unethical and potentially stigmatizing topics. They were also informed that they could skip 

questions, stop the interview or leave at any time. All participants gave verbal informed consent 

and were provided with the information for emergency campus mental health services. Students were then asked a combination of semi-structured and open-ended questions about their 

ideologies and experiences as they related to medical factors (ADHD, Adderall, pharmaceuticals, 

doctors); social factors (family, peer groups, socialization, drinking/drug use); and academic factors (transitions into college, academic culture, study habits, grades). Each interview followed 

a similar order, starting with questions about their hometown, family life, experiences in high 

school, transitions into college, early and current college life, experiences with Adderall and 

other drugs, and expectations after graduation. This order allowed me to build rapport with 

students and see how their self-reported values and behaviors evolved over time and were

reflected in their experiences with and around Adderall.

Interviews were transcribed with the help of six undergraduate research assistants and averaged twenty-eight single-spaced pages per transcript. We reviewed transcripts for accuracy and then imported them into NVivo9 software (QSR International Pty Ltd). Initially, we coded the transcripts around three primary contexts: medical, social and academic. As analysis proceeded, we used a grounded theory approach to create increasingly in-depth coding categories based on emergent themes and patterns. Research assistants completed initial coding based on these categories and I later adjusted codes in order to ensure consistency.

1.1.2.2  Participant Observations and Informal Interactions with Students

During interviews, I built rapport with students and attended a number of private and social gatherings where prescription stimulants were openly discussed, sought after, distributed, and consumed. In general, students were open to talking about Adderall use in front of me, especially when they learned that it was the subject of my research. On multiple occasions, students openly shared their own narratives or stories about a friend or roommate who had a particularly positive or negative experience with the drug. The ease with which I was able to gain access to these moments speaks, in part, to the normalization of this behavior.

By coupling interviews with participant observations, I was able to identify the congruencies and dissonances between how my informants described themselves during interviews—as healthy, empowered and responsible individuals—and their lived experiences as students, friends, patients, drug dealers and drug users. Additionally, during my day-to-day life at American State University, I witnessed conversations and pharmaceutical practices in public spaces frequented by students, such as the library, coffee shops, in classrooms, and in the

cafeteria. I recorded these informal observations as field notes over the twenty-four-month period. However, due to the informality of these interactions, I did not systematically code them into any software program. Key findings from these observations are incorporated into the case 

studies, which are presented in the corresponding data chapters of this dissertation.

1.1.2.3  Informal Interactions with ADHD Experts

Initially, my target sample for interviews was limited to students and did not include a protocol to recruit health service providers for formal interviews. However, during my fieldwork, I had a number of opportunities to observe how discourses about ADHD and stimulants were being constructed among experts and eventually disseminated to patients. This included informal interactions with medical experts (clinicians, psychiatrists, psychologists, neurobiologists), 

educational experts (disabilities services employees, ADHD college program managers) and cultural experts (ADHD coaches, book authors, ADHD advocates). My interactions took place at two ADHD conferences sponsored by Shire Pharmaceuticals, as well as two professional university disabilities services conferences near my field site. These events featured presentations and workshops by leading ADHD experts: clinicians, psychiatrists, ADHD 

coaches, and university disabilities services employees. Following the public presentations, I informally interacted with professionals one-on-one and was able to build rapport and ask more in-depth, informal questions pertaining to my research. I was also able to attend several ADHD 

coaching classes via teleconference with a nationally renowned ADHD expert, and learn about other coaches’ experiences working with ADHD college students.

Over the course of my fieldwork, I became well acquainted with several individuals involved in ADHD assessment and disabilities resources management at American State

University. As a direct result of these connections, I attended four private group meetings with various health and disabilities services programs at American State, which were followed by 

informal group and individual discussions regarding the proper management of ADHD students. 

I maintained regular contact with these individuals and met with them on a number of occasions 

for coffee or dinner. Additionally, I observed interactions between professionals and patients while accompanying my primary student informants in clinical settings during ongoing participant observations. This included two initial ADHD consultations and eight follow-up 

doctor’s appointments. While these interactions were relatively short (around fifteen minutes) I witnessed a glimpse of the dynamics between students and mental health professionals. 

During these interactions, I elicited attitudes toward over/under diagnosis of ADHD, over/underprescription of stimulants, relationships with the pharmaceutical industry, and perceptions of Adderall use among college students. I was interested in how these professionals distinguished between responsible and irresponsible Adderall use, and how they described their responsibility to prevent or facilitate these behaviors. Although I had informal interactions with dozens of professionals over the course of my fieldwork, the case examples from Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 

are based on data from the following informants: an ADHD advocate/public speaker, an ADHD 

coach, a privately-employed psychiatrist, a university-employed psychologist, the director of an 

academic support program for students with ADHD, and a university-employed disabilities 

services provider.

1.1.2.4  Critical Discourse Analysis of Pharmaceutical Marketing Campaigns

In order to illustrate how moral discourses around responsible Adderall use were produced in the marketing context, I conducted a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of selected 

31

direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements sponsored by Shire Pharmaceuticals, the makers of blockbuster ADHD drugs Adderall and Vyvanse. This included a thorough review of digital 

documents, images, and videos related to industry-sponsored contests, scholarships, resources, 

events, and anti-abuse materials. I focused particularly on those campaigns directed at college 

students and their parents and present three case examples in Chapter 3. These include (1) The “Own It” Initiative—a set of contests and commercials aimed at adults who believed they outgrew their ADHD; (2) The “U do the Rest” Campaign—a set of contests and resources for 

adults to use in combination with stimulant treatment; (3) The Michael Yasick ADHD College 

Scholarship—a financial award sponsored by Shire for students with ADHD that includes ADHD coaching services; and (4) CPAMM—a coalition of medical and educational professionals, funded by Shire, who are addressing the issue of prescription stimulant misuse. My analyses of these campaigns are based on Fairclough’s (1989) three-dimensional framework 

for analyzing the ideological work of advertisements, relations-content-subjects, which is described in detail in Chapter 3.

**1.2.2  Data Analysis**

As I collected and coded my data, I used a grounded theory approach to capture the range of logics that individuals used to manage the moral flexibility of these drugs and to express themselves as moral pharmaceutical subjects. I began by identifying social and personal moments of moral breakdown across each context, examining how Adderall both triggered and resolved these ethical dilemmas. These moments of moral breakdown fell roughly along two lines: social and personal concerns over preventing responsible Adderall use and/or facilitating irresponsible Adderall use. In this case, social moments of moral breakdown refer to debates 

32


---

###### Page 44

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_44_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_44_7.png)

around Adderall use and concerns facing entire industries and institutions. Data about these 

social moments were collected from both media sources and from informants who voiced their 

concerns about what responsibility the pharmaceutical industry, medical professionals, and the 

institution of higher education should bear in facilitating the responsible use of Adderall. Alternatively, personal moments of moral breakdown are those moral experiences in which 

individuals were consciously responding to and situating themselves within these debates to 

assert themselves as responsible advertisers, ADHD experts, drug dealers, and consumers. Data 

for these personal moments included informants’ self-reported experiences, given during 

interviews and informal interactions, as well as the moments I witnessed firsthand during participant observations.

To systematically map these moral experiences, I returned to Geest, Whyte, and Hardon's 

(1989) framework for tracing the social life of pharmaceuticals and identified both social and personal moments of moral breakdown. Specifically, I looked for instances in which actors were pulled out of an unreflective moral state and forced to consciously consider or respond to 

anxieties of over facilitating, failing to prevent, and/or participating in “irresponsible” Adderall use. I situated these moments within larger public debates around the moral marketing, prescription and circulation of stimulants. By analyzing informants’ premeditated and in-themoment responses to these concerns, I was able to uncover the range of logics that individuals 

drew upon to assert and preserve their moral subjectivity. These questions are outlined in Table 4 below.

In the first three contexts (marketing, treatment, and circulation), I focus on the ways in which experts are producing discourses of health, empowerment, and responsibility and how they are explicitly defining responsible Adderall use. I examine how these discourses are transmitted and absorbed in each subsequent setting as new experts and stakeholders enter the scene and redefine responsible Adderall use. In the final context (use), I focus on the actual drug user to see how these discourses endure and/or mutate as students actively consume and make sense of their complex experiences with prescription stimulants.

Most previous research approaches the topic of prescription stimulants through the lenses of medicalization and, more

recently, biomedicalization. Instead, I foreground my study in the pharmaceuticalization studies 

literature in order to shed light on the influence of prescription stimulants outside the context of ADHD treatment. As a result, my research demonstrates the limitations of medicalization and biomedicalization theory to fully explain modem pharmaceutical experiences. My dissertation is 

also informed by recent studies in the health and social sciences that specifically investigate 

illicit Adderall use among US college students. It also takes into consideration recent popular 

and academic debates around the neuroethics of prescription stimulant use by the healthy. I provide an overview of this literature and its theoretical frameworks, which I directly engage in the corresponding data chapters of this dissertation.

In Chapter 3,1 explore how responsible drug use is defined and facilitated by Shire 

Pharmaceuticals and its consumers through the DTC marketing of prescription stimulants. I present four case examples that highlight moments in which Shire strategically reacted to 

allegations that they had irresponsibly promoted unsafe, unfair, or ineffective products to their 

consumers, and examine the ways that Shire rationalized their new marketing practices, enacted 

in response to these allegations, as acts of social responsibility. My analyses indicate that there is 

an ongoing struggle between the pharmaceutical industry and its consumers over the proper 

definition of ADHD and over the regulation of the responsible use of prescription stimulants. I use these case studies to show how Shire has teamed up with ADHD experts to create new forms 

of engaged consumerism, founded on the goal of responsible stimulants consumption. In the process, they manufacture Adderall’s symbolic meaning, presenting it as an empowerment drug rather than a controversial performance enhancer or a form of medical social control. They have 

also constructed what appears to be a clear distinction between responsible and irresponsible 

stimulant use. As a result, Shire has delegated both the benefits and burdens of Adderall use back 

35

###### Page 47

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_47_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_47_7.png)

to consumers and to the medical professionals charged with prescribing and monitoring Adderall use. I argue that Shire’s delegation places upon consumers the responsibility to consume 

stimulant medications while also promoting others’ responsible use of stimulants.

In Chapter 4,1 explore how responsible drug use is defined and facilitated by ADHD 

experts and patients through the diagnosis, treatment, and management of the condition. I present 

six case examples that highlight moments in which ADHD experts strategically responded to 

allegations of over-facilitating or preventing access to diagnoses/treatments/accommodations, 

and examine how these experts rationalized their decisions to either facilitate or deny stimulant use as acts of social responsibility. My analyses indicate that there is an ongoing struggle between ADHD experts and clients to reconcile the compartmentalization of ADHD services 

across medical and social contexts. I juxtapose vignettes in each context to show how experts rely on their positionality to stimulants, which are framed as un/safe, un/fair, and in/effective treatments, to assert their authority over these facilitations and denials, presenting themselves as responsible service providers in each case. Still, in each of these facilitation/denial exchanges, the symbolic meaning of stimulants as medication destabilizes as both experts and clients unsuccessfully attempt to standardize qualifications for, and fair access to, ADHD services and medications. As a result, clients must strategically assert their congruent identities as patient, 

consumer, and/or student in order to navigate these multiple contexts and rationalize their desire 

for ADHD services. I argue that by doing so, both ADHD clients and experts are able to maintain a perceived sense of responsibility to consume stimulants while also promoting the responsible stimulant use of others.

In Chapter 5,1 explore how responsible drug use is defined and facilitated by Adderall 

dealers and seekers during the willful diversion of stimulants, or the “drug deal.” I present three 

36

###### Page 48

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_48_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_48_7.png)

in-depth case examples that highlight moments in which ADHD students strategically resisted or participated in the Adderall market on campus and rationalized their decisions as acts of social responsibility. My analyses indicate that there is an ongoing struggle between ADHD students 

and Adderall seekers to define and ensure responsible stimulant use during each drug transaction. 

I use a combination of ethnographic vignettes and interview data to show how ADHD students rely on their positionality to stimulants, which are viewed as as effective, coveted, but potentially 

dangerous medications, as a way to assert their agency over these exchanges and present themselves as responsible drug stewards. However, with each exchange, the symbolic meaning 

of stimulants as medications becomes unstable as students struggle to determine which seekers 

are worthy of their valued medications. As a result, ADHD students must strategically assert their identities as patient, student, or friend in order to navigate these morally ambiguous 

exchanges and rationalize their decisions to conserve or distribute these powerful drugs. I argue that by doing so, ADHD students are able to maintain their perceived sense of responsibility over the responsible drug use of others.

In Chapter 6,1 explore how responsible drug use is defined and facilitated by college 

students who consume ADHD medications without a legal prescription. I present six case 

examples that highlight moments in which students interpreted a positive or negative drug 

experience and subsequently developed strategies to make themselves feel like responsible drug users. My analyses indicate that students experience an ongoing struggle to make sense of and maintain agency over the chemical and symbolic transformation that comes from consuming Adderall. I use a combination of ethnographic vignettes and interview data to show how these 

students rely on their interpretations, creating strategies that help to mitigate the medical and 

social side effects of the drug. Yet with each swallowed pill, the symbolic meaning of stimulants 

37

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_49_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_49_7.png)

as self-medication, enhancement, and/or recreation becomes completely unstable as students 

struggle to justify their controversial behaviors. As a result, students must constantly reassert boundaries between their moral selves and the potentially immoral pharmaceutical practices they 

engage in. I argue that by doing so, these students are able to rationalize their behaviors as a form of responsible, albeit illicit, Adderall use.

In Chapter 7,1 provide an overview of key findings from my research and situate them within anthropological theories of pharmaceuticalization and morality. In particular, I present an overview of emergent patterns from across the economic, medical and academic contexts that 

speak to the management of moral subjectivity in these various capacities. I also reflect on the usefulness of pharmaceutical morality as an analytical tool and the value of ethnography in investigating moral experiences.

**CHAPTER 2: MORAL LANDSCAPES**

This chapter provides a historical and theoretical context for understanding the modem medical landscapes that circumscribe prescription stimulant use among college students in the US. It links together selected anthropological and sociological literature that considers the role of prescription stimulants in post-industrial American society. I focus specifically on work that describes the cultural influence of these drugs in relation to attention disorders within academic 

settings as the medicalization of deviance (Conrad 1975) and, more recently, the biomedicalization of performance (Conrad and Potter 2005, Clarke et al. 2003). In the first half of this chapter, I explore intersecting trends in morality, pharmaceutical subjectivity and the 

symbolic meaning of stimulants through the lens of medicalization and biomedicalization. I 

engage the concept of moral breakdowns to articulate the juncture between these two paradigms in relation to public perceptions of and concerns over prescription stimulants. I contextualize these breakdowns within a number of broader socio-historical factors, including the evolution of 

attention disorders and the transformation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription stimulant marketing in the last half century. In the second half of this chapter, I offer an overview of key 

features within the modem DTC stimulant marketing, treatment and circulation landscapes. This overview sets the stage for the following data chapters, which more deeply investigate the ethical dilemmas associated with access to stimulants and how it effects the moral experiences of US 

college students.

### **2.1  HISTORICAL LANDSCAPES**

The cultural meaning of prescription stimulants is deeply entangled with the 

establishment of psychiatry, and the subsequent medicalization of attention disorders in postwar

American culture. Conrad and Schneider (1980) suggest that after WWII, medicine had replaced religion as the dominant moral ideology and placed health as “a primary value in American society.” They argue that this commitment to health served as justification for the treatment and control of undesirable individuals - a process they define as “medicalization.” Robbins and Anthony (1982:284) note that “controversies over medicalization tend to involve psycho­ emotional problems and the definition of mental health.” This psychopathological model of illness was not only effective in redefining deviance as mental illness, but also helped to establish the American psychiatric field in the 1950s (Conrad and Schneider 1980). Accordingly, many issues of social or moral regulation such as gambling, addiction and homelessness had fallen under the medical jurisdiction (see Rosecrans 1985; Schneider 1978; Matheiu 1993). Although this movement was not exclusive to American society, Conrad and Schneider (1980:263) argue that it has “been nowhere more pervasive than in the United States.”

Clarke et al. (2003) suggest that in the mid-1980s, American medical culture underwent a second transformation which they define as a movement from medicalization to biomedicalization. They explain,

Biomedicalization describes the increasingly complex, multisited, multidirectional 

processes of medicalization, both extended and reconstituted through the new social 

forms of highly technoscientific biomedicine. The historical shift from medicalization to 

biomedicalization is one from control over biomedical phenomena to transformations of 

them (161). Conrad (2005) also notes that the drivers of medicalization have shifted to include the pharmaceutical industry, insurance companies, and patient groups. However, he critiques the concept of biomedicalization and argues that “medicalization is expanding and, to a degree, changing, but not morphing into a qualitatively different phenomenon” (5). Although I agree in part with Conrad’s claim that there is no clear disjuncture between the two paradigms, I adopt

40

Clarke et al.’s terminology to refer to key shifts in the cultural function of stimulants over the last forty years. In particular, I focus on the re-imagination of prescription stimulants as modes of social control in postwar American society to modes of social transformation during the turn of the century and into present day. I am particularly interested in how these perceptions have persisted or evolved to inform modem expectations of responsible stimulant use in the US college setting.

Although medicalization and biomedicalization studies offer insights into the cultural significance of prescription stimulants, I use pharmaceuticalization as the primary theoretical lens in this dissertation. Abraham (2010) argues that certain socio-historical aspects of pharmaceutical consumption have features which cannot be properly described by the medicalization framework and the authority of doctors. Instead, he identifies the political economy of the pharmaceutical industry, deregulatory state ideology, and consumerism as key factors that have fostered pharmaceuticalization. He does, however, suggest that medicalization and pharmaceuticalization can be mutually reinforcing processes, especially in the case where medical professionals work with, or for, the pharmaceutical industry to create and redefine disease categories. Abraham describes this as the “medicalization-pharmaceuticalization complex” (608). I consider this concept and the intersections between these processes to understand how prescription stimulants operate within and outside of sanctioned medical settings. I am especially interested in exploring how pharmaceuticalization influences the emergence of illicit prescription stimulant economies and how these drugs become re-engaged and/or detached from their original medical purpose during these illicit exchanges.

In the following sections, I provide a brief history of prescription stimulants in the context of broader socio-historical factors, including the evolution of attention disorders and the 

41

###### Page 53

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_53_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_53_7.png)

transformation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription stimulant marketing in the last half century. My overview is limited to those factors which directly inform the experience of US college students and does not include insights into other aspects of prescription stimulant history. For example, investigating the modem relationship between prescription stimulant manufacturers and medical professionals, as well as the politics of creating and refining disease categories in the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual (DSM) is beyond the scope of this chapter. I also limit this chapter to sources which I directly engage to analyze the data produced by study of US college students.

**2.1.1  Ritalin as a Mode of Social Control**

Although attention disorders were not an established psychiatric category in the DSM until the late 1960s, the positive effects of stimulants on children with attention issues was first documented in 1937. Dr. Charles Bradley, the director of a hospital for neurologically impaired children, routinely conducted examinations which caused severe headaches in his patients. He attempted to treat the headaches by administering Benzadrine, one of the most powerful stimulants available at the time. While the treatment did little for the headaches, he observed subsequent improvement in the behavior and school performance of certain children. He later identified those who were most likely to benefit from Benzedrine treatment as characterized by short attention span, dyscalculia, mood lability, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and poor memory. Although Bradley would go on to publish his findings in a number of medical journals, it would be decades until stimulants would be acknowledged as a viable treatment for children who displayed these characteristics (Lange et al. 2010).

During this time, Bezadrine continued to be a well-recognized treatment for a number of 

42

###### Page 54

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_54_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_54_7.png)

established medical conditions in adults, ranging from narcolepsy to senility. In 1944, chemist Leandro Pannizon synthesized a safer alternative to Benzadrine called Methylphenidate. It was 

eventually manufactured as “Ritalin” by Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceuticals in 1954 (Lange et al. 2010). Donohue (2006) notes that the nature of Ritalin marketing was directly influenced by the

1951 FDA amendment of the “Durham-Humphrey Amendment” to the 1938 “Food, Drug, and 

Cosmetic Act” which significantly broadened the “prescription-only” federal drug classification 

(Donohue 2006). Tone and Watkins (2007) argue that this act also served to establish doctors as the “expert gatekeepers” to these drugs and pharmaceutical companies as the primary suppliers of prescription medicines. Donohue (2006) explains that although more drugs were now labeled as prescription-only, they did not carry the same level of product information/labeling as OTC 

drugs. This is because the FDA found some drugs to be so dangerous that they limited information about the drug to prevent any attempts at self-medication. Instead, the labeling was provided to doctors and pharmacists who would relay the appropriate information to patients and 

facilitate the consumption process. Donohue further notes that this mechanism of drug dispensing also aligned with the American Medical Association’s long-held objective to reduce 

self-medication and increase physician’s control over the use of pharmaceuticals. Shortly thereafter, pharmaceutical companies stopped advertising directly to consumers and focused all of their resources towards advertising to doctors.

Conrad (1975) argues that strategic prescription stimulant marketing was a primary driver in the medicalization of children’s deviant behavior in the early 1960s. He describes how CibaGeigy placed multi-page print ads in medical journals and mailed print ads directly to doctors urging them to diagnose and treat “hyperkinetic” children. They also relied on the efforts of “detail men”, or pharmaceutical reps, and funded professional conferences on the disorder in 

43

###### Page 55

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_55_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_55_7.png)

order to engage with doctors face-to-face. Conrad explains that while most of the promotion was targeted towards the medical sphere, information about diagnosis and treatment of the newly discovered disorder was also directed to the educational sector. He states that drugs like Ritalin had become a mode of “medical social control wielded” by doctors to assert their authority over the deviant behavior of hyperactive children in the postwar America. Accordingly, 

advertisements produced by the pharmaceutical industry targeting physicians appeared in medical mailers cleverly portraying them through images and camera angles that underscored their clinical authority during the diagnostic and treatment processes (Singh 2007).

Lange et al. (2010) note that the increasing recognition of attention issues in children 

among the medical community eventually lead to the introduction of attention disorders into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-II) in 1968. The condition was called “Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood” and was defined in only two sentences: “The Disorder is characterized by over activity, restlessness, distractibility, and short attention space, especially in young children; the behavior usually diminishes by adolescence” (American Psychiatric Association

1968). This nebulous definition further supported the authority of medical doctors to be able to detect the condition based on their expert training (Conrad 1975). However, Diller (2009) 

explains that in the 1970s, sensationalized media coverage around Ritalin lead to a series of 

congressional hearings set to clarify the prevalence and proprietary use of the drug among children. He argues that latent anti-authoritarian trends from the 1960s encouraged nondepressive theories of childhood behavior. This, coupled with anti-industrial trends in organic 

foods, natural healing, and the rejection of pharmaceuticals, made people wary of potential forms of chemical “mind control” like prescription stimulants.

Lange et al. (2010) explain that in 1980, the disorder was renamed “Attention Deficit

44

###### Page 56

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_56_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_56_7.png)

Disorder” or ADD in the DSM-III to reflect findings from current research of the disorder. It was described as manifesting as one of two subtypes: with or without hyperactivity. This 

conceptualization was a departure from the World Health Organization (WHO)’s definition in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) that focused on hyperactivity as a prominent indicator for the diagnosis of ADD. This iteration of the DSM also included three new symptom lists for inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Further, it added a numerical cut off score for 

symptoms, guidelines for age of onset and duration of symptoms, as well as the requirement of 

exclusion of other psychiatric disorders. In 1987, a revision of the DSM-III was released that removed the two subtypes of ADD and renamed the condition “Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder” or ADHD. Lange et al. (2010) explains that it was argued that the initial creation of 

subtypes was not based on empirical findings. Instead, the new criteria were derived from rating 

scales and a field trial - supporting the combination of symptoms for inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity were into a single list with a single cutoff score.

**2.1.2  Moral Breakdowns: The Ritalin Wars**

In the 1980s-90s, the concerns over the safety of prescription drugs took a head with wide 

scale media coverage of the “Ritalin Wars” (Diller 2000). This term referred to a series of lawsuits that were filed by the The Citizens Commission on Human Rights as well as a number of independent plaintiffs against Novartis (formerly Ciba-Ciegy) over the negative effects of Ritalin on children. For example, LaVame Parker, whose son had been diagnosed with ADHD, 

filed a $150 million federal lawsuit against an Atlanta area school district, several physicians, 

and the American Psychiatric Association (APA). She claimed that her son had been medicated with the drug at the insistence of the school district and that it had made him violent and suicidal 

45


---

###### Page 57

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_57_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_57_7.png)

(Treadwell 1987). Similar cases were filed in Massachusetts, Minnesota, and California by 

school districts, doctors, and the American Psychiatric Association and claimed that these groups promoted ADHD as a disease and encouraged Ritalin as the prime treatment for it. Although these suits were eventually dismissed, cases of this nature continued to be filed through the early 

2000s (Diller 2000).

The late 1990s also marked the emergence of the consumer’s rights and patients’ rights movements that demanded increased medical information and involvement in the medical 

decision making process (Donohue 2006). Abraham (2010) explains that this resulted in politically polarized attitudes towards drugs in the US. Thus, while some consumers focused on promoting the benefits of these technologies, others fought to raise awareness about the dangers they pose to both individual health and society at large. In particular, ADHD advocacy groups 

like “Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder” (CHADD), founded in

1987, served as the voice of the consumer to demand treatment for this condition. According to their mission statement,

CHADD emerged in response to the frustration and sense of isolation experienced by 

parents and their children with ADHD. At that time, one could turn to very few places for 

support or information. Many people seriously misunderstood ADHD. Many clinicians 

and educators knew little about the disability, and individuals with ADHD were often 

mistakenly labeled a behavior problem, unmotivated, or not intelligent enough (CHADD 

Mission Statement 2016).

These organizations worked closely with doctors and the pharmaceutical industry to advocate for the needs of disempowered children and adults who suffered from attention disorders and required services and accommodations.

While public debates around the social costs and benefits of stimulants continued, Lange 

et al. (2010) explains that the formal definition of ADHD also continued to evolve through the turn of the century. In the next iteration, DSM-IV (1994), the heterogeneous category of ADHD 

46


---

###### Page 58

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_58_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_58_7.png)

was once again divided into three separate subtypes: “predominantly inattentive”, 

“predominantly hyperactive” and a combined type with presentation of both sets of symptoms. 

However, the most significant change was that ADHD was no longer conceptualized as an 

exclusively childhood disorder, but rather a chronic, persistent condition that could continue into 

adulthood. However, an individual must have shown an onset of symptoms before the age of 

seven to qualify as ADHD. Conrad and Potter (2005) suggest that the increased recognition and 

establishment of Adult ADHD, and especially the increase in prescription stimulant use, was due to the effort of a number of scientific research, patient advocacy and the changing landscape of pharmaceutical advertising.

**2.1.3  Adderall as a Mode of Social Transformation**

Fisher and Ronald (2008) note that the patient’s rights movements in the 1990s emerged 

alongside a larger shift towards a neoliberal model of healthcare in the US which they refer to as 

“medical neoliberalism.” They describe this as a system where “healthcare is not a right 

guaranteed to citizens but is instead composed of products and services to be purchased by those who can afford them” (32). Elliot (2003) explains that this type of commodification reframes health and illness in terms of products and services that can be purchased by engaged consumers. 

In particular, it promoted the invention of what Applbaum (2006) refers to as the informed medical consumer. He explains that “since, in a consumer society, we see ourselves as 

individuals and as free agents when we exercise consumer choice, it is not difficult for pharmaceutical companies and other privatized health-care deliverers to convince us that it is 

empowering to think of ourselves not as patients but as consumers” (446). In 1998, the US FDA 

changed its guidelines on direct-to-consumer or DTC advertisements to enable widespread

broadcast advertising of prescription drugs (Ronald 2006). Donohue (2006:675) explains, “early DTC campaigns demonstrated the role that patients could play in health care, acting as price­

conscious consumers or talking with their physicians about a condition that might otherwise not be detected.” Moreover, it gave the industry an opportunity to strategically bypass doctors and promote their products directly to the consumer (Ronald 2006).

It was during this time that Adderall was first introduced on the market by Shire Pharmaceuticals as a treatment for ADHD. The drug was originally approved by the FDA in the 

1960s under the name “Obetrol” by Rexar Pharmaceuticals as a weight loss drug. However, in

1994, the company sold the rights to the Obetrol formula to Richwood Pharmaceuticals (now 

Shire Pharmaceuticals) and in 1996 Adderall was approved for the treatment of ADHD. IMS Health (2000) reports that prescriptions for stimulants and in particular Adderall increased from

1.3 million in 199 6 to nearly 6 million in 1999, reflecting, in part, the efficacy of DTC model of drug marketing.

Sigh (2007) notes that the images of Adderall in advertisements from the late 1990s and 

early 2000s were significantly different that those that appeared for stimulants during the 1950s-

1980s. In particular, they made no visual attempt to educate viewers about the behavioral 

symptoms of ADHD, only the solutions made possible by the drug. Sigh explains, “the journey of stimulant drug advertising into the public domain has taken the claims of the drug maker from 

control, to a blurring of control and normalization, to a clear vision of enhancement” (149). This type of message served to tap into the concerns of patients over the medical negligence of 

doctors and present medications as a source of empowerment. At the same time, Fisher and Ronald (2008) argue, “what is labeled as empowering can be better thought of as a neoliberal maneuver to make individuals increasingly responsible for their health and well-being through

the consumption of pharmaceutical products” (35).

Dumit (2011) describes the potential for DTC advertising to convert viewers into patients or medical consumers as “pharmaceutical witnessing.” He argues that this marketing strategy works by educating viewers about an illness, motivating them to self-diagnose, and convincing them to seek brand-specific treatments. The pharmaceutical industry has historically legitimized such tactics by claiming DTC marketing has an educational function that helps consumers make informed health choices (Conrad 2004; Dumit and Greenslit 2005).

Green (2007) further points out how DTC drug advertising serves to reify disease categories as being drug-centered. He explains, “when pharmaceutical companies define their products’ indicated diseases as markets, they bring a logic of brands and commodities into the definition of disease itself’ (17). Conrad (2004) notes that this tactic has been particularly effective in markets for medicalized conditions, such as ADHD, where symptoms are ambiguous and stimulants are presented as “lifestyle drugs” that can instantly solve social problems. Singh (2007) argues that over time, drugs like Ritalin and Adderall were re-cast in DTC advertisements as medically sanctioned “performance enhancers” that could benefit children and adults alike. Thus, the decision to seek an ADHD diagnosis and a subsequent prescription for stimulants is framed by DTC marketing as an act of both empowerment and responsibility on the part of the consumer to improve their health and social well-being (Conrad and Potter 2000).

In conjunction with DTC, Conrad (2008) suggests that the medicalization process had shifted towards a consumer-driven model of health where doctors were no longer the ones pushing diagnoses on their patients. By the late 1990s, new players had entered this economy, including parents, educators, insurers, drug companies, and potential patients who could each benefit from an increase in pharmaceutical prescriptions. As the participation and influence of

these parties in the treatment process increase, he argues that doctors must actively renegotiate their relationship to their patients and society at large. Dumit (2012) also discusses the influence 

of pharmaceuticalization on the doctor-patient relationship in his description of “doctor 

disempowerment” (14). He suggests that patients are taking advantage of the modem constraints placed on doctors to demand treatment for themselves (and their children). Dumit argues, 

“Doctors, in turn, because of the multiple pressures of limited patient time, keeping up with rapidly changing information, the constraints of healthcare maintenance organizations and 

insurance, are quite vulnerable to these demands” (14). Moreover, Howard et al. (2016) shows how the centralized medical authority of primary care physicians has been diffused to team­ based models of care. They argue that these “shifts in domains of knowledge involved patient 

engagement and decision support, patient-focused responsibility or ‘ownership’ for one’s own 

care, and team-based care” (14).

These observations of diffused medical knowledge resonate with the what Henwood et al. 

(2003) describe as the rise of the “expert patient” or “informed patient” - a neoliberal subject that was popularized in medical discourse at the turn of the century. They explain that this 

subject is based on the belief that “the greater availability of health information via the Internet will lead to the emergence of more informed patients who are better able to assess the risks and benefits of different treatments for themselves” (590). However, they argue that this idealized view of an expert patient has many constraints in practice, including the lack of interest or ability 

for consumers to easily locate reliable information. Moreover, they found that physicians are 

often unwilling to negotiate with patients, especially when “lay knowledge does not coincide with expert/medical knowledge and where a certain level of compliance with medical opinion is required” (606). Similarly, Fox et al. (2006:1300) suggest that “professionals cling to in their 

50

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_62_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_62_7.png)

engagements with patients, controlling information and dismissing efforts by patients to theorize or explain their condition.”

These findings are particularly salient when considering the process of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD within college settings. Studies show that there is an especially high potential for malingering, or faking symptoms during diagnosis in order to gain access to prescription stimulants (Rabiner et al 2009). A recent study by Cepeda et al. (2014) also indicates that once diagnosed, some ADHD patients will cross state lines in order to "shop for doctors" who are willing to meet their demand for prescription drugs.

At the same time, Elliot (2010) argues that doctors have not completely shed their relationships with the pharmaceutical industry where drug reps and free drug samples are still common fixtures in clinical settings. Hunt et al. (2012) also describes the influence of “pay for performance” programs that incentivize physicians treating chronic illness to prescribe pills despite the adverse side effects and financial strain it puts on patients. These entanglements and conflicting objectives call into question alliances in the new era of pharmaceuticalization and how drug manufacturers, health service providers and US college students are negotiating moral agency through the sale, prescription and consumption of prescription stimulants.

### **2.2  MODERN LANDSCAPES**

In the remainder of this chapter, I examine key features of the modem prescription stimulant landscapes that circumscribe the moral experiences of US college students who engage with these drugs. In particular, I focus on those factors which have significantly altered the landscapes described above and directly inform the data chapters of this dissertation. These sections link together key studies that examine the proliferation of prescription stimulants in

academic settings with broader trends in DTC drug marketing, diagnoses and treatment of ADHD. It also considers public concerns around prescription stimulants that are constructed and 

circulated in academic and popular media outlets. My goal is to explore the range of ideologies that emerge and evolve in relation to pharmaceuticalization to inform attitudes and expectations 

around responsible stimulant use across these diverse settings. I am particularly interested in how these expectations differ among various stakeholders who contribute to a moral understanding of this drug behavior in college settings.

**2.2.1  Modern Marketing Landscapes**

The efficacy of DTC marketing in the last decade has exponentially increased the number 

of individuals on ADHD medications, but it has also re-stimulated concerns over the safety of these powerful drugs (Diller 2016). This is due in large part to the accessibility to and publicity 

around data that offers quantitative evidence of the dangers related to prescription stimulant use. 

For example, a national report from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) indicates a fivefold increase in prescription stimulant-related 

emergency room visits from 2005-2011 (SAMHSA 2014). This and similar reports are periodically featured in major media outlets and followed by several days of public outrage over the issue at hand. There are also a number of individuals and organizations who attempt to maintain awareness of these issues on a more consistent basis. For example, noted psychiatrist 

and author David Healy, aims to empower consumers through ongoing projects like ======Rx==isk.com==== a website where individuals can search for and report drug side effects. Additionally, publicity 

around young American celebrities like Lindsay Lohan, Jessica Simpson, and Justin Bieber, who have gone to rehab to deal with their Adderall addictions, has brought attention to these issues in 

52

the popular sector.

Along with medical concerns, there are also those who continue to question the chemical 

efficacy of stimulants to treat ADHD or if ADHD is even a real condition to begin with (Caroll 

2014). Some suggest that DTC advertising has served to medicalize underperformance in the 

classroom and workplace, while others view Adderall as a cognitive enhancer that gives users an unfair advantage over others (Stolz 2012). Others see the drug as a band-aid solution for larger problems within the American education system, including larger classroom sizes, emphasis on 

grades over learning, as well as the sheer cost of higher education (McMahon 2007). Thus, the 

decision to consume prescription stimulants comes with both medical and social risks, including the stigma of identifying as ADHD, being called a cheater, and/or continuing to perpetuate the underlying problems with the education system. In these scenarios, Adderall use is not seen as an 

act of empowerment, but of individual and social irresponsibility.

Despite these widespread critiques, the fact remains that stimulant sales have never been better and the market for ADHD treatments has exponentially grown in the last decade. Today, there are over thirty name brand medications and over twenty generic versions available in the US - the vast majority of which ==are pres==cription stimulants (==Dr==ugs.com==== 2015). As a result, 

companies must continue to find ways to set themselves and their products apart, especially when their medications are more expensive than their competitors. This includes promoting the 

safety and efficacy of the drug as well as establishing trust in the company itself through 

strategic brand-centric marketing. For example, in 2014, Shire produced what they call their 

“Annual Responsibility Review,” a 27-page document that outlined progress towards their “four pillars of responsibility” to their patients, people, planet and partners. Such projects included 

increased transparency in clinical research, increased diversity within their company, eco-

friendly business practices, and partnering with local charities to fund humanitarian projects 

(Shire 2015).

The rise in ADHD diagnoses coupled with the concern over the safety and stigmas of prescription stimulants has also opened a market for alternative ADHD treatments. Many of these are non-prescription, unapproved capsules and tablets which have capitalized on consumer 

demands for instant increases in cognitive function without the complications of prescriptions. A w==eb s==earch on ==Am==azon.com== ==for “Adderall”, for instance, yields over 70 results, and a search for 

“cognitive enhancer” yields almost 200 products, with names like “Brain Energy” and “Focus 

Pep.” The neurological refraining of ADHD has also created a market for neurofeedback and biofeedback service providers like “Brain Core” and “Neurocore” who have offices around the 

country - including two within ten miles of my field site. Advertisements for these programs also pander to parents and adults who want to treat ADHD without the medical side-effects or social 

stigmas of stimulant medications. Many of these programs are fully covered by health insurance, making them an even more enticing alternative to potentially expensive pharmaceutical treatments.

There has also been an increase in non-medical forms of ADHD management, such as 

academic and professional coaching. Kubik (2010) explains that coaches are not necessarily psychiatrists or medical professionals, though many may have a background in these areas. 

Today, there are dozens of certification programs, most of which adhere to the International 

Coaching Federation's guidelines, yet no formal certification is required to start a coaching practice. The benefit of coaching comes from the focus on "behavioral, emotional, and cognitive 

outcomes and buildfing] life skills to change negative outcomes and beliefs" (Kubik 2010:1). 

There is an emphasis on empowering the client to manage the neurological limitation of ADHD, 

54

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_66_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_66_7.png)

known as “executive functions” in more personalized way. Cost and breadth of services varies by coach but the drawback is that it can be relatively expensive as it is not covered by most 

insurance.

This mass increase in both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatments for ADHD 

suggests that the condition has become widely recognized and accepted in mainstream American 

culture. Conrad (2000) explains that this is in part the result of joint efforts by the pharmaceutical 

industry and patient advocacy groups such as CHADD and Attention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA). These alliances have become increasingly fundamental to stimulant sales 

given the rise in information-based health consumerism and skepticism over information provided directly from the pharmaceutical industry. For example, groups like CHADD and ADDA connect directly with potential and diagnosed patients, intermittently through industry-

sponsored conferences, and pervasively through newsletters and social media. In these 

communications, ADHD is vehemently framed as a genetically-based, neurobiological disorder rather than a temporary psychiatric condition. Thus, “while thirty years ago adult ADHD might have been an oxymoron, today it is deemed a discrete disorder that can be claimed and 

diagnosed” (Conrad 2000:575). Further, it can also be reclaimed, given that the populations of 

children initially diagnosed with Attention Disorders in the 1970s-1990s are now adults who may have since stopped taking their medications. Thus, “by redefining ADHD as a lifetime 

disorder, the potential exists for keeping children and adults on medication indefinitely” (Conrad 

2000:568).

The exponential growth in social media in the last decade should also be considered when understanding the modem drug marketing landscape. Sites like Twitter and Facebook allow marketers to engage with consumers on an unprecedented level of frequency and intimacy. This 

55

###### Page 67

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_67_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_67_7.png)

has created a new generation of consumers who have become more accustomed to the idea of 

engaging directly with advertisers in order to exercise their consumer rights and improve their buying experience. Thus, although the pharmaceutical industry has not yet found a legal avenue to explicitly advertise medications through social media, it is still leveraging this culture of 

engaged consumerism through similar strategies. Examples from Shire Pharmaceuticals include 

sponsoring national contests, giving out awards, and collaborating with consumers in public 

service projects - all of which signal a significant departure from the one-way discourse of traditional DTC drug advertising of the late 1990s-early 2000s (Shire 2015).

**2.2.2  Modern Treatment Landscapes**

In 2013, the DSM-5 included a revised set of criteria to assist medical professionals in 

diagnosing ADHD in adults. This included an extension in the age of onset from age 7 (grade 

school) to age 12 (middle school) and a reduction in the number of required symptoms from 6 to 

5 out of a possible 18. They also rephrased the three subtypes of ADHD - inattentive, hyperactive, and combined - to “presentations,” which meant adults could associate with various 

symptoms over the course of their life. Finally, they suggest that the experience of ADHD could be qualified as mild, moderate, or severe, the distinctions of which are based on how many 

symptoms a person has and how difficult those symptoms make daily life. The American 

Psychological Association (ASA) released a statement supporting these changes, stating that they 

“more accurately characterize the experience of affected adults” and that it “ensures that children with ADHD can continue to get care throughout their lives if needed” (ASA 2013).

However, not all medical professionals agree with these changes and professional 

critiques of ADHD as a valid and discrete category in the public arena continue to persist. For 

56

example, behavioral neurologist Richard Saul published a controversial book in 2014 titled, 

“ADHD Does Not Exist: The Truth about Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder.” He 

argues that ADHD is not a discrete condition, but rather a complex cluster of symptoms 

stemming from over 20 other conditions and disorders ranging from depression to giftedness to poor eyesight. He asserts that the symptoms of the condition require their own specialized treatments, rather than a blanket prescription stimulant regime. Saul expands on this critique by 

citing the highly addictive nature of stimulants, their short-term efficacy, and their ultimate 

detraction from identifying the underlying cause of a patient’s symptoms.

Like many psychiatric disorders, there are no objective laboratory or neuropsychological 

confirmatory tests to diagnose ADHD, nor is there established consensus on the specific cluster 

of symptoms that constitute the condition (Hallahan and Kaufman 2005). Instead, medical professionals rely on a variety of assessments to determine whether an individual displays the minimum number of symptoms to qualify for an ADHD diagnosis. These assessments include: ADHD symptom checklists, self- or clinician-rated behavior scales, diagnostic interviews, history of past and current functioning and observational input from family members and close 

associates. While the results of these assessments can provide a basis for, or supplement to a 

diagnostic interview, ultimately, the diagnosis is based on the medical provider’s professional 

opinion (Hallahan and Kaufman 2005).

As a result, critics argue that increases in ADHD diagnoses are due to the ambivalence of these assessments, allowing anyone to qualify as a candidate for ADHD (Hallahan and Kaufman 

2005). Timmi and Leo (2009) explain this in their analysis of DSM criteria/symptoms list for the 

condition and suggest that ADHD assessments “can only rate a particular adult’s perception of a particular [patient] at a particular moment in time. In other words, they are measures of the 

57

###### Page 69

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_69_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_69_7.png)

subjective perception of the [doctor] filling in the rating scale. What they cannot be is an objective, factual piece of ‘hard data’ that measures something intrinsic to the [patient]” (5). Rabiner et al. (2009) note that this flexibility has also created an opportunity for college students to deliberately over report symptoms to procure academic accommodations or feign ADHD to obtain a prescription for stimulants for nonmedical purposes.

Another reason ADHD continues to be such a contested disorder is because its diagnosis and treatment is currently compartmentalized across a number of medical and cultural paradigms. As a mental illness, ADHD diagnosis and treatment falls under the purview of psychiatry which often relies on a combination of talk therapy and/or the use of psychotropic drugs to treat symptoms. Experts in this field are certified medical doctors who are able to prescribe stimulants as needed. More recently, ADHD symptoms are explained through the neurobiological approach, which defines it as a genetic disorder possibly affecting genes that produce and regulate Dopamine (Tripp and Wickens 2008). Typically, experts in this field are scientists who are pursuing research trying to find the biological basis of disease. The purpose of stimulants in this context is to correct the imbalance of chemicals in the brain due to the person's genetic makeup. Martin (2007) explains that neurobiological conditions are well received by patients because they provide a scientific explanation and label to a perceived shortcoming. This allows the individuals to escape the burden of being labeled lazy, stupid or crazy (Kelly and Ramundo 2006).

Another framework for understanding ADHD is as a behavioral disorder with additional attention problems. Doctors might diagnose someone with ADHD based on issues in the classroom or in workplace that interfere with their ability to interact with others. In this modality, the purpose of stimulants is to help control, modify, or normalize the behavior of the patient. It 

58

###### Page 70

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_70_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_70_7.png)

can also be a legitimate explanation for the poor behavior of a person in these environments. ADHD has also been described more specifically as a cognitive disorder or a developmental 

impairment of executive functions (Barkley 1997). This continues to become a prominent paradigm because, like the neurobiological approach, it explains behavior in terms of the brain. 

Experts in this field are doctors who have done significant research on ADHD and how it works with and within the brain. The function of stimulants in this modality is to correct the executive 

functioning problems of the patient. The ADHD patient benefits from this perspective as it is both neurobiological and behavioral. This allows them to explain their behaviors in a biomedical way. This is treated with cognitive behavioral therapy in an attempt to change or fix the disorders 

(Bramham 2008).

While the science of ADHD continues to evolve, cultural paradigms of ADHD treatment 

are also important to consider. For example, ADHD has recently been described as Learning 

Disorder because its symptoms can create difficulties in classroom settings and due to new 

legislation on disabilities rights. This is due in large part to the the Individuals with Disabilities 

Education Act (IDEA) of 1999, which classified ADHD a disability and enabled students to receive special education accommodations if they meet qualifying criteria (Vickers 2010). While this modality can provide important benefits to ADHD students, it also charges disabilities 

service providers are now with translating and accommodating the biomedical symptoms of this behavior. At the same time, information about the condition has become increasingly available to professionals across these paradigms, as well as to the general public. In fact, there are 

approximately 9,000 books available on Amazon on topics ranging from a beginner's guide to the neurobiology of ADHD to how to treat your own ADHD by changing your diet, to coping with your ADHD child, spouse or loved one. There are also a growing number of ADHD experts

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_71_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_71_7.png)

who are known for their work in this field and have a significant impact on public perceptions of the condition - as well as the function/necessity of stimulants treatments.

**2.2.3  Modern Campus Stimulant Landscape**

As more and more students arrived on campus with ADHD diagnoses and legal access to prescription stimulants, Adderall quickly became the drug of choice for healthy students looking to increase focus, manage time, and enhance academic performances. For example, McCabe et 

al. (2006) analyzed survey responses from almost 20,000 full time undergraduates at 119 universities regarding the prevalence of illicit use and diversion of four classes of abusable prescription drugs; sleeping medication, sedative /anxiety medication, stimulant medication and pain medication. Their results indicated high rates of illicit use and attempted diversion of these prescription drugs. Among the four classes of prescription drugs, medically prescribed 

stimulants, such as those used to treat ADHD, were most likely to be approached to divert their medication. In fact, more than half of the undergraduate students with prescriptions were 

approached by peers without medical prescriptions to acquire their medication. The study also 

indicated that illicit users are likely to be unaware of a drug’s documented contraindications, precautions, or interactions with other drugs.

DeSantis et al. (2008) analyzed 1,811 survey responses and 175 structured interviews 

from undergraduates at a southeastern university regarding non-medical Adderall use. Their results indicated that 4% of students reported having legal prescriptions for the drug and 34% of the remaining population has used Adderall without a prescription. They report that most of these students reported using Adderall during periods of high stress, and found it to “reduce 

fatigue while increasing reading comprehension, interest, cognition and memory” (315). They 

60


---

###### Page 72

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_72_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_72_7.png)

also report that “most had little information about the drug and found procurement to be both easy and stigma-free” (315). DeSantis et al. (2010) also note that Adderall use was not viewed to be dangerous or immoral among drug seekers, which increased the likelihood of participation in this drug behavior.

The lack of perceived danger stems, in part, to the source of prescription stimulants on college campuses. In their study of Adderall dealers, DeSantis et al. (2013) contend that 30% of students in their sample who took stimulants illegally received them from the 3.4% of students on campus who had legal prescriptions. In other words, Adderall users were seeking drugs from their peers who were themselves ADHD patients - not professional drug dealers. This is important because it illustrates the high demand for illicit drugs compared to a relatively limited supply. Vrecko (2015) agues that many students develop what he calls “scrounging strategies” to obtain Adderall to use on a regular basis. Informants in his study reported feeling uncomfortable asking for Adderall directly because “an explicit request might be perceived as greedy or presumptuous, or might risk putting a friend in the awkward position of having to refuse an appeal for help” (299). Instead, they would wait for friends to offer the drug.

Although there has been a significant amount of research from the health and social science literature regarding illicit drug seekers, few ethnographies focus explicitly on the moral subjectivity of drug dealers, and even fewer attempt to understand what Inciardi et al. (2009) refer to as the “black box of prescription drug diversion.” This presents a significant barrier in understanding the moral subjectivity and experiences of ADHD students who do not operate in traditional drug markets or fit the socio-demographic mold of most illicit drug users or dealers. In particular, there are a number of factors that set the circulation of Adderall on college campuses apart from other illicit drug markets. For example, McCabe et al. (2006) conducted a 

61


---

###### Page 73

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_73_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_73_7.png)

large scale survey of undergraduates at a large Midwestern University and found that the majority of Adderall dealers on college campuses are white male upperclassmen who are 

involved in Greek life. In their book Dorm Room Dealers: Drugs and the Privileges of Race and 

Class, Mohamed and Fritsvold (2010) argue that predominantly white, upper-to-middle class 

demographic of American college students brings with it certain entitlements. They argue that “if 

a person does not fit the stereotypical drug carrier or drug dealer profile of young urban minority male, regardless of whether levels of actual drug dealing and drug use are on par with or exceed that of the stereotypical dealers, trafficking and illegal drugs becomes a significantly less risky 

enterprise” (33). It is possible that because of this perceived impunity from the law, college 

dealers, and especially prescription drug dealers, rarely take legal implications into consideration when dealing their drugs.

This lack of impunity is also due, in part, to the fact that prescription stimulants operate 

in what Mohamed and Fritsvold call a “closed market” in which dealers only sell to people they personally know and for whom they can vouch. They explain that “closed markets offer both 

dealers and customers more security and because of the closer interpersonal ties and consistent 

supply streams, closed markets offer customers some degree of quality assurance over the drugs they buy” (12). McCabe et al. (2006) report that demographics of the typical Adderall dealer mirror those of the typical illicit Adderall user, suggesting that they are part of the same social networks. Moreover, 100% of undergraduates in their survey reported obtaining the drug from a 

friend or family member.

Another important factor to consider in the productive reputation of prescription 

stimulants in academic settings. In the last decade, drugs like Adderall have become central to 

debates on the ethics of pharmaceutical cognitive enhancement or “cosmetic neurology” among 

62

###### Page 74

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_74_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_74_7.png)

not only academic, but also scientific and medical professionals. Some view pharmaceutical 

enhancement as an academic or career choice, like other consumer commodities - such as buying a cup of coffee or hiring a math tutor - that may not necessarily be available to everyone 

(Farrah et al. 2004). Thus, these “enhancements” have the potential to significantly widen 

existing social inequalities and may lead to coercion of students, employees and even military personnel to take the drugs in order to remain competitive in their fields (Appel 2008).

At the same time, the viability of these drugs to actually enhance brain function remains 

in question. While there have been several ongoing studies indicating potential increases in reading efficiency and short term memory retention, many argue that there are cognitive trade­

offs including a loss of creativity and critical thinking (Chatterjee 2004). These questionable 

advantages must be further placed in perspective with the cited health risks of ADHD medications. Despite proponents deeming these drugs “safe enough” by the FDA for children 

and ongoing clinical trials with healthy individuals, negative effects can include cardiovascular problems, potential for abuse and even death (Harris 2009).

### **2.3  CONCLUSION**

In this chapter, I offered a brief overview of the emergence of medicalization and biomedicalization in American society and underscored the explicitly moral and neoliberal 

dimensions of these shifts. The period of postwar medicalization marked the creation of the moral pharmaceutical subject through the conflation of badness and sickness as described by 

Conrad and Schneider (1975). This process informed and reflected changes in American psychiatry and pharmaceutical culture that made way for the medicalization of deviant childhood behavior as a type of attention disorder. The pharmaceutical industry paralleled these changes as

they pharmaceuticalized this condition and empowered doctors as the gatekeepers of these magic bullet cures, emphasizing their role in promoting ADD as an established category.

The shift towards biomedicalization emerged in relation a significant social moment of moral breakdown in which Americans both desired liberation from the medical imperialism of 

doctors and more control over their healthcare choices. This played out as a desire for more medical attention and care for ADHD as exemplified by the establishment of CHADD, as well as the rejection of pharmaceuticalization as exemplified by the Ritalin Wars. America evolved in relation to this moment of moral breakdown by turning to neoliberal medicalism, which was presented as patient empowerment by the government as well as the pharmaceutical industry. 

This turn was a key feature in the shift towards biomedicalization where individuals no longer 

saw medications as forms of social control, but opportunities for social transformation. 

Furthermore, the history and promotion of Adderall during this shift in the early 2000s illustrates how the medicine was now being promoted as a lifestyle drug that could instantly fix issues of underperformance. Lastly, biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization have evolved in the last 

decade in three spheres: the modem marketing landscape, the modem treatment landscape, and the modem university stimulant landscape.

This chapter serves as a foundation to understanding how changes in these spheres have 

led to a new set of moral breakdowns associated with the evolution of pharmaceuticalization in the last decade. In the following chapters, I highlight these moments of moral breakdown with 

each of these contexts in order to understand how advertisers, health service providers, dmg 

dealers and dmg users are positioning themselves in these morally convoluted landscapes.

**CHAPTER 3: MARKETING**

This chapter explores how responsible stimulant use is defined through the direct-to-

consumer (DTC) marketing of prescription stimulants to U.S. college students. Its purpose is to provide insights into how attitudes and opinions around responsible stimulant use are 

constructed, translated and filtered from the marketing landscapes into the college context. It builds on selected anthropological literature that describes the informed medical consumer, a neoliberal subject who empowers themselves through calculated pharmaceutical consumption. 

Here, DTC marketing produces a powerful one-way discourse through which drug companies 

can passively inform consumers about undiagnosed illnesses and potential treatment options. 

This includes strategies such as personalizing risks, motivating self-diagnosis, and creating branded compliance. Accordingly, it becomes the consumer’s responsibility to act upon this 

information and make a responsible decision about seeking diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatments.

I build on this literature and consider how the DTC marketing of prescription stimulants to US college students has evolved in respect to pharmaceuticalization in the last decade. 

Increases in prescription stimulant sales have raised public concerns over the intentions and 

actions of drug companies who irresponsibly promote unsafe, unfair, or ineffective products to their consumers. I use media reports to provide insights into public discourse surrounding this 

social moment of moral breakdown and highlight the ethical dilemmas faced by the pharmaceutical industry. I situate these dilemmas within the evolving stimulant marketing 

landscape described in Chapter 2 and illustrate how factors, such as the increasing competition in medical and non-medical treatments and evolving consumer demographics and expectations, have reshaped the producer-consumer relationship.

My goal in this chapter is to examine how drug advertisers have morally positioned themselves, their products, and their consumers in relation to this social moment of moral breakdown. To accomplish this, I conducted a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of selected DTC marketing campaigns sponsored by Shire Pharmaceuticals, that target current and future college 

students. This included a review of digital documents, images and videos related to industry-

sponsored contests, scholarships, resources, events and anti-abuse campaigns. I present four case 

examples that highlight moments in which Shire positioned themselves in response to public 

concerns around DTC stimulant marketing and framed their promotion of pharmaceuticals as 

acts of social responsibility. These case examples are organized around campaigns which both promote the responsible use of stimulants and condemn irresponsible prescription drug behaviors. I present my analyses of these case examples around Fairclough’s (1989) framework 

of relations-objects-subjects to systematically map the moral discourses that surround and are produced through the modem DTC marketing of prescription stimulants. I conclude the chapter with a discussion of how this analysis informs conceptions and expectations of pharmaceutical morality and subjectivity among US college students.

### **3.1  MORAL BREAKDOWN: LOSING CONSUMERS OR SELLING SICKNESS**

Over the last decade, annual sales for ADHD medications have skyrocketed from $4.7 billion in 2006 to $12.9 billion in 2015, and is projected to reach $17.5 billion by 2020 (IBIS 

Health 2015). The number of adults filling these prescriptions has also increased by nearly 50% 

from 2008 to 2012 (Express Scripts 2014). For ADHD advocates such as Dr. Russell Barkley, the growth in the prescription stimulant market reflects a four-decade long effort to increase 

awareness for the condition as well as the fulfilled promise of advanced pharmaceutical science 

66

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_78_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_78_7.png)

to meet their medical needs (PBS 2001). At the same time, the increase in prescription stimulant 

sales continues to raise significant public concerns over the legitimacy and social acceptability of traditional DTC marketing and the powerful products they promote. As a result, the pharmaceutical industry is faced with the dilemma of selling ADHD medications without 

alienating potential consumers.

Media commentaries on these concerns offer key insights into how Americans are responding to the growth of DTC stimulant marketing as a social moment of moral breakdown. 

For example, in 2013, New York Times journalist Alan Schwarz published a scathing article titled “The Selling of ADHD,” which highlighted the dangers of irresponsibly marketing, prescribing, and consuming prescription stimulants. The piece chronicled the pharmaceutical 

industry’s mission to increase sales in the late 1990s by transforming the diagnosis from a temporary psychological condition affecting only children, to a lifelong neurological disorder that goes unrecognized in many adults. Schwarz showed how companies like Shire

Pharmaceuticals spent significant resources educating doctors about this new paradigm of ADHD management through online training sites and industry sponsored conferences. While 

increases in diagnosis rates reflect the efficacy of these strategies, Schwarz quoted several 

doctors who referred to the phenomenon as a “national disaster of dangerous proportions.” These 

critiques echoed the sentiments of the Institute of Medicine (IOM) who went on record in 2009 to condemn these questionable alliances between medical professionals and the pharmaceutical 

industry (IOM 2009).

Schwarz further described how companies like Shire relied on DTC marketing through television commercials, print advertisements and online materials to promote their products 

straight to consumers. Many of these ads encouraged the parents of high school students and 

67


---

###### Page 79

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_79_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_79_7.png)

college students who were unsatisfied with their child’s academic performance to seek treatment 

for ADHD. As a result, sales figures for stimulants more than quintupled between 2002-2012. At the same time, Schwarz cited the numerous warning letters Shire and other manufacturers received from the FDA instructing them to withdraw ads for being false, misleading, and/or over 

exaggerating the effects of their medications. In one letter from 2008, Shire is accused of 

insinuating that Adderall XR was proven to prevent the consequences of untreated ADHD such 

as receiving poor grades, being unemployed, or being socially outcast. The FDA letter reports, 

“while research shows Adderall XR can improve patients’ total scores on the ADHD-RS-IV in 

clinical trials versus placebo, it in no way supports the transformative claims these 

advertisements suggest” (FDA 2008).

The FDA also accused Shire of omitting critical risk information about contraindications, warnings and precautions associated with the drug in the online advertisement. Schwarz went on to remind the reader of how dangerous and addictive these stimulants can be, especially when their use is not supervised by a responsible medical professional. He quoted Roger Griggs, the pharmaceutical executive who introduced Adderall in the late 1990s, as referring to the medication as “nuclear bombs” that should never have been marketed to consumers in the first place. In contrast, current industry executives hold steadfast to the belief that they are upholding their responsibility to their consumers to educate them about ADHD and its potential treatments. 

More so, they place responsibility on the consumer to work with his or her medical professionals to make sure ADHD is properly diagnosed, monitored, and treated.

The concerns outlined in Schwarz’s article are part of a long-standing public debate over the legitimacy and social acceptability of traditional DTC marketing and the powerful products they promote. It has emerged as the result of a number of factors that shape this new marketing

landscape, including public fears over the safety of stimulants, increasing competition among treatment options, and evolving consumer expectations and demographics. In particular, the 

expiration of Adderall’s patent and the introduction of Vyvanse in 2007-2008 presented an 

opportunity for the remarketing of ADHD and stimulants to consumers within this context. In this chapter, I examine how Shire Pharmaceuticals has positioned themselves in order to navigate this morally convoluted environment. Specifically, I ask, how is responsible stimulant use 

defined and facilitated by Shire and its consumers through DTC drug marketing? How do these 

interactions influence and embody shifting expectations around the responsibility of US college 

students to facilitate and participate in responsible stimulant use? In the following sections, I 

explore these questions and investigate how Shire is framing ADHD treatment, the function of 

stimulants, and the role of the responsible consumer in relation to this social moment of moral breakdown.

### **3.2  CASE EXAMPLES**

To better understand this landscape, I examined over a dozen recent marketing 

campaigns from Shire pharmaceuticals promoting their ADHD medications Adderall and Vyvanse, as well as their company in general. This included a review of television commercials, websites, brochures, reports and other documents associated with domestic and international ADHD awareness and pharmaceutical marketing campaigns targeted towards students and young 

adults. My analyses of these campaigns are based on Fairclough’s (1989) three-dimensional 

framework for analyzing the ideological work of advertisements: relations-content-subjects. He 

describes this framework as follows:

69


---

###### Page 81

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_81_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_81_7.png)

1. **Building relations.** Advertising discourse embodies an ideological representation of 

the relationship between the producer/advertiser of the product being advertised, and the 

audience that facilitates the main ideological ‘work’.

2. **Building images.** Advertisements get their audiences to draw upon ideological 

elements in their members ’ resources (MR) in order to establish an ‘image ’for the 

product being advertised.

3. **Building the consumer.** Advertisements use ‘images ’ which audiences ‘help ’ them to 

generate for products as vehicles, construct subject positions for ‘consumers ’ as 

members of consumption communities. This...is the major ideological work of advertising 

(167). The term ‘Members’ Resources’ or MR is used by Fairclough to include what “people have in their heads and draw upon when they produce or interpret texts - including their knowledge of language, representations of the natural and social world they inhabit, values, beliefs, assumptions and so on” (24). This includes both negative and positive experiences they have had with ADHD symptoms and prescription drugs, as well as values specific to American higher education and young adult life. Based on this, the viewers then position themselves to the featured object (prescription stimulants or ADHD management resource) in order to participate in a particular desirable (and in this case, empowered and responsible) lifestyle that Fairclough refers to as a “consumption communities.” Using Fairclough’s model, I examine how these various forms of DTC advertising work ideologically to present moralized exchanges between the drug companies and consumers (building relations), the perceived function of prescription stimulants in the context of ADHD management (building images) and the intersecting ideologies of health, empowerment, and responsibility that produce the ideal ADHD sufferer (building the consumer). Ultimately, the goal of this chapter is to show how these DTC campaigns have redefined what it means to be an empowered, yet responsible, prescription stimulant consumer in this evolving marketing landscape.

In the following sections, I present four case examples that highlight moments in which 

Shire strategically situated themselves against concerns over irresponsibly promoting unsafe, unfair, or ineffective products to their consumers and rationalized their marketing practices as 

acts of social responsibility. These cases include (1) The “Own It” Initiative - a set of contests 

and commercials aimed at adults who believed they outgrew their ADHD (2) The “U do the 

Rest” Campaign - a set of contests and resources for adults to use in combination with stimulant treatment (3) The Michael Yasick ADHD College Scholarship - a financial award sponsored by 

Shire for students with ADHD that includes ADHD coaching services and (4) CPAMM - a 

coalition of medical and educational professionals, funded by Shire, who are addressing the issue 

of prescription stimulant misuse.

**3.2.1  The Own It Initiative: Responsibility as Taking Ownership**

In his historical analysis of Adult ADHD, Conrad (2004) notes that one of the primary 

functions of DTC advertising is to raise awareness for medicalized conditions. While Shire 

continues to profit from new diagnoses and subsequent prescriptions, they have also begun targeting adults who were once diagnosed with an attention disorder but have since discontinued their treatment. This can occur for several reasons, including: a rejection of their childhood 

diagnosis; a rejection of ADHD as a legitimate illness; a belief that they outgrew the condition; 

feeling stigmatized because of their diagnosis; a fear of side effects from or dependency on prescription stimulants. As Dumit (2012:76) explains, “Marketers do not like stigma because they fear it will inhibit self-recognition of patient status and therefore reduce prescription 

demand. They call these stigmatized diseases, ‘diseases of denial’, implying that individual psychology is at the heart of the marketing problem.”

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_83_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_83_7.png)

In order to address these concerns and recapture this demographic, Shire launched the “Own It Initiative” in 2011, a series of advertisements that reframed ADHD acceptance and management as a fundamental responsibility of becoming an adult. In a press release from 2011, they explain, Adam Levine, lead singer of Maroon 5, and Shire today announced the launch of ‘The 

Own It Project’. The Own It Project is designed to encourage adults who are taking 

responsibility for their ADHD - and owning it - to motivate others to do the same by 

entering their story for a chance to become the next Own It spokesperson... Prize 

package options for the contest include sessions with an ADHD coach. The winner also 

will receive an autographed guitar as a personal gift from Adam Levine... The leaders of 

patient advocacy groups CHADD and ADDA have released the following joint statement 

in support of The Own It Project: ‘It’s so important for people with ADHD to hear from 

their peers and share experiences. “The Own It Project” does just that - and we support 

the project as one that encourages the ADHD community to support itself.’ The rhetoric in this ad campaign was powerful because it not only acknowledged the stigma of being labeled as ADHD, but also encouraged patients to embrace, embody, and promote the diagnosis. It attempted to create a sense of biosociality among potential consumers by reminding them that they belong to an ADHD community, whether they like it or not. In other words, the responsible consumer should not just accept their diagnosis, but “own it” and incorporate as a part of their individual and group identity. Moreover, they are willing to team up with the pharmaceutical industry in order to motivate others to get re-assessed by their doctors now that they are adults. By soliciting patients through the Own It Project, Shire was also able to collect original narratives about consumer experiences with ADHD and treatment, to which they now own the rights. In return, the consumer was rewarded with commercial prizes, like an autographed guitar, or treatment-oriented prizes, such as access to alternative forms of ADHD management, like coaching. Given the potential apprehension of their target consumers around stimulant medication, Shire strategically placed focus on accepting the diagnosis before introducing their drug, Vyvanse, through subsequent marketing.

Shire eventually released a series of commercials for the “Own It” Initiative, which aired between 2012-2014. One of which featured the winner of the contest, a graduate student named “Megan M.” who undergoes a transformation in her academic performance and social circumstances once she finally accepts her ADHD diagnosis. At the end of each commercial, viewers w==ere enco==uraged to visit "==own==youradhd.com====" to find out more about ADHD and potential treatment options. The website was divided into three sections, each of which uses a particular marketing strategy to entice viewers to become diagnosed and seek treatment. The first 

section is titled, “We Own Our ADHD. Hear Our Stories”. It links the viewer to the “Own It” DTCA commercials featuring Megan M., as well as celebrity personalities, like musician Adam Levine and athlete Shane Vicotorino, who are generally considered successful adults, owning their ADHD. This campaign drew on the use of celebrity to increase awareness and to illustrate the potential social benefits of overcoming one’s ADHD. The Own It Initiative featured 

celebrities who many young adults would be familiar with and might aspire to be. Moreover, it was insinuated that the decision to treat ADHD was the reason why they have become successful in their particular field. This implies that if the viewer also “owns their ADHD,” they too could 

achieve the same level of professional success.

Once the viewer has overcome the concerns of ADHD-related stigmas and has become open to the possibilities of success that treating the condition might allow, they were then primed 

for self-diagnosis. The second section of the website featured an “Adult ADHD Screening Test.” The questions are rated on a Likert-type scale of 5 choices: never, rarely, sometimes, often, very often. It included questions such as “How often do you have problems remembering 

appointments or obligations?” and “When you have a task that requires a lot of thought, how often do you avoid or delay getting started?” If the user scored between 0-3, the system prompts 

73


---

###### Page 85

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_85_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_85_7.png)

a generic response that indicated that “ADHD is Unlikely”. If the user scored between 4-6, the 

system indicated that “ADHD may be likely”. It further explained that although the quiz score does not indicate a real diagnosis, it is likely that others with the same score did eventually receive a diagnosis and treatment. In her study of DTC advertising for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD). Ebling (2011) explains that these types of checklists are now a staple of most prescription drug websites. They serve to “universalize and personalize the bodily experience of 

symptoms and translate that experience into a need for treatment and action by the patient” 

(831).

Now that the viewer has been convinced that “ADHD may be likely,” they may have 

questions about the details of the condition and what to do next to address this newly recognized problem. Accordingly, the third section of the website was titled “Get Answers to your questions 

about ADHD.” It features a series of dropdown menus structured around four questions: “(1) Is ADHD a real condition? (2) Can ADHD be managed? (3) How is ADHD diagnosed? (4) Are there tips that may help?” After a brief answer reifying the likelihood of diagnosis and necessity of treatment, the viewer was prompted to click on a “learn more” tab which took them directly to “www.adhdandyou.com.” This is an informational website hosted on Shire’s primary website to inform potential consumers about ADHD and its treatments. It features a page called “Getting to know your ADHD team” and includes information on coaching, cognitive behavioral therapy, 

and medications. The significance of this page is that both Shire and its products are framed as part of a larger ADHD management plan that is supported by these other treatment modalities. Given the growing popularity of ADHD coaching and new forms of behavioral therapy, it is in 

Shires best interest to leverage their support in presenting a more palatable model of treatment 

for their target consumer base - especially those who are still skeptical or concerned about

prescription stimulant use.

**3.2.2  The UDo the Rest Campaign: Teaching Responsibility**

As ADHD patients continue to deal with the stigmas and challenges associated with prescription stimulant use, Shire has also reimagined the ideal relationship between consumers 

and the drug itself. This is due in large part to public commentary and published research on the 

in/efficacy of ADHD medications to increase performance. One of the most common critiques is that stimulants give their user an unfair advantage in competitive fields such as higher education, professional athletics, and the workplace (Firger 2014). Thus, ADHD patients face accusations 

of being called cheaters who did not rightfully earn the successes they achieved while on their medication (i.e. the magic bullet it too magical). Ironically, another common critique is that 

stimulant medication alone is not effective enough to give the user the desired performance 

enhancing effects (i.e. the magic bullet is not quite magical enough) (Hamilton 2010). Some 

studies even suggest that the feelings of success related to the consumption of stimulants can be 

attributed to the placebo effect (Looby and Earliwine 2011). In one case, the drug is perceived as being too powerful, and in the other, not powerful enough.

Shire addressed both these concerns when they developed the “U Do the Rest” campaign, which shifts the responsibility and rewards of successful ADHD management from the medication back onto the consumer. Between 2013-2014, Shire featured a number of 

advertisements on the Vyvanse website with a variation of the tag line "Vyvanse manages my ADHD. I do the Rest." The ads linked to “UDoTheRest.com,” which welcomed users with a 

statement that reads, “What’s the rest? All the stuff you do for yourself. This site is filled with 

specially selected apps, articles, tips, and more to help with the rest.” Like the “Own it”

75

###### Page 87

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_87_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_87_7.png)

Initiative, the U Do the rest campaign focused very little on the efficacy of Shire’s pharmaceutical products and instead attempted to train the patient on how to be an empowered, responsible and engaged medical consumer.

The viewer was introduced to a curated set of industry manufactured materials and 

collections of outside resources that promote a particular view of ADHD - one that is 

simultaneously neurological (because they still want to sell you their drug) but also individual, in that everyone experiences the condition differently. Moreover, they asserted that these are 

challenges specific to ADHD and that learning to cope with them is ultimately the responsibility 

of the consumer. For example, each section of the website offered infographics, copy written by

Shire, and step by step tutorials on everything from “How to organize your closet” to “How to prepare for class” to “How to prepare for a job interview”. These topics are especially relevant to young adults and especially college students who were looking to increase their academic performance and prepare for an unstable job market. As a result, the “U Do the Rest” campaign 

continued to promote the role of the pharmaceutical industry as an “educator” who empowers their consumer with valuable information and resources to help manage their condition.

In 2014, the “U Do the Rest” campaign featured a national contest called “Organize your 

Stuff”, which offered a number of prizes to “adults who want help organizing their space and reducing clutter.” Entrants were asked to submit a photo and description of a space they wanted help organizing and the challenges holding them back. The grand prize winner would receive up to $2500 worth of prizes, including a gift card to The Container Store, a tablet with pre-loaded 

organization apps, and a consultation with a professional organizer. A press release from Shire in 

2014 explained,

“Shire today announced the winners of the Organize Your Stuff contest, which was 

designed to help adults organize their space and reduce clutter. Sydney Bloom, 28, from

76

###### Page 88

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_88_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_88_7.png)

Charlotte North Carolina was chosen as the grand prize winner after submitting a picture 

of her craft room and the reason she needed help organizing it... To help Sydney achieve 

her organizational goals, Monica Friel, president and founder of Chaos to Order, a 

respected professional organizing service, designed and implemented an individualized 

organization plan... ‘The success of the contest demonstrates a real need for the resources 

Shire provides through UDotheRest.com’ said Perry Sternberg, Head of the Neuroscience 

Business Unit at Shire. ‘As leaders in the ADHD space, Shire understands the challenges 

individuals with ADHD may face” (Shire 2014).

The before and after photos from the organizing session were featured on the blog “From Chaos to Order”. The fact that the before picture was not that dramatically chaotic suggests that even the mildest ADHD challenges can benefit from the help of an industry professional. It also is 

important to note that Shire did not sponsor a makeover (akin to the magic bullet model of ADHD treatment). Instead, they sent an expert organizer to teach Sydney how to successfully manage the symptoms of her ADHD (akin to the ADHD team management approach). At the 

same time, prescription stimulants remain an important, implicit, yet understated part of this management model. We can see this when we go back to the U do the Rest website and zoom 

out to see that the initially hidden bottom half of every page does in fact feature information 

about Vyvanse. Thus, even the structure of the website itself promoted a particular view of the responsible prescription stimulant user - one who must literally build her own personalized ADHD management plan on top of a necessary and supportive pharmaceutical foundation.

Although securing brand loyalty has always been a priority for the industry, the U Do the

Rest campaign shows how Shire has moved away from simply showcasing the superiority of their drugs, to promoting a sense of shared responsibility with their consumers and allied ADHD 

service providers. Shire holds up their end of the relationship by providing new and improved pharmaceutical treatments, access to ADHD experts and resources, and incentives to empower the consumer to own and face their ADHD challenges. Thus, if the consumer was successful, it was a team victory - if not, it was a failure on the part of the consumer, not the pharmaceutical

company that went above and beyond their role to produce safe and effective drugs.

**3.2.3  The ADHD College Scholarship: Rewarding Responsibility**

While ======UdoTheRest.com====== offers some helpful tips for academic success, Shire had also created a set of supplementary materials to secure brand loyalty among the college demographic. 

Specifically, they set out to show that their company knows exactly what it takes to achieve a successful college experience, from obtaining admission into the right institution, to finding a job after graduation, and everything in between. For example, the website “ADHD & You” featured a set of resources intended to help prospective college students and their parents prepare for the daunting process of applying for college. One of these guides is titled “6 Steps to College” and featured thirteen pages of checklists and resources that promise to simplify the college search process. Another guide, titled “The College Testing Guide” offered similar advice on the specifics of college admissions exams, such as the SAT and ACT. Information included in the guide ranges from how to choose an exam, to how to study for an exam, to how to prepare for the actual test day. For example, one page of the guide suggested that a week before the exam, parents should encourage their child to “chill out” and practice driving the route to the exam. These resources insinuate that the successful college experience starts with parents who are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that their ADHD student gets the help they need, including medication. This follows the same logic of the U Do the Rest campaign in that parents cannot expect stimulants alone to get their kids into a good school - but luckily, Shire is there to help them along the way.

These resources were also linked to one of Shire’s most innovative marketing campaigns for college students - “The Michael Yasick Scholarship” program, first established in 2007.

Scholarships are available in the U.S. and Canada and include a $1,500-2,000 monetary award and a pre-paid year of weekly ADHD coaching from The Edge Foundation ($4,400 value).

Students are eligible for the scholarship if they (1) have been formally diagnosed with ADHD, (2) are currently accepted or enrolled in an undergraduate program at an accredited university (not a trade/technical/ vocational school), and (3) are under the care of a licensed healthcare professional for their ADHD. Since its inception, the program has provided over 250 scholarships and continues to offer 50 scholarships per year. According to the press kit posted to their website:

The ADHD Scholarship by Shire is named in memory of Michael Yasick, a senior 

executive at Shire whose vision made the Scholarship possible. Mike envisioned the 

Shire ADHD Scholarship as a way to recognize brave individuals with ADHD who work 

hard to overcome the challenges of the condition and to help them continue their 

educational pursuits.

The creation of this scholarship program acted to secure Shire’s role as supporters of access to higher education. Because ADHD has become an academically-centered condition, it is beneficial for Shire to build relationships with students and their parents - in this case through financial and other non-pharmaceutical resources. The scholarship program also allows Shire to collect demographic data and testimonials from students who submit applications and essays for the contest, which Shire can use at their own discretion. According to the website, “The

Scholarship Sponsor may use the Application in any manner and in any medium or form, whether now known or not currently known, throughout the world in perpetuity without compensation, permission, or notification to the applicant or any third party.” This allows Shire complete freedom to solidify the value and success of their scholarship program by promoting the experience of former recipients. Names of all winners and their institutional affiliations are listed on the website. The press kit also features testimonials from students who have received

the award and how it has helped them succeed in college. For example, “I’m grateful to Shire for investing in my education and believing in me. Receiving this 

honor instills me with confidence.” - Mallory Hansen, West Virginia University “The Shire ADHD Scholarship served to reaffirm the hard work I’ve done to get to 

where I am now in college. With the Edge coaching, I’ve been able to work with 

someone who fully understands the issues unique to those with ADHD.” - Tom Kline, 

Oswego State University “As a freshman, I was unprepared for the demands of college. My ADHD coaching 

experience equipped me with the life skills necessary to adjust and succeed!” -

Jacqueline Martin, Tuskegee University In these testimonials, ADHD is presented as a barrier to academic success. It is not something that defines a student, but is an external challenge that can be managed by medication and coaching. The responsible consumer is presented as a student who is pursuing formalized higher education and seeking help for their ADHD through multiple avenues. Shire frames this pursuit as not just an act of responsibility, but one of bravery. The notion of battling one’s condition in order to beat the odds is a powerful metaphor in which Shire, Vyvanse, and the Edge Foundation fight side-by-side. Although the sheer cost of college is also part of the battle for most students, it is important to note that these scholarships are not dispersed according to financial need. Rather, they are seeking students who represent the prominent demographic of their target consumer base and actually have a chance at succeeding in college (regardless of financial need). Moreover, they are expected to do more than simply earn good grades. This expectation is articulated in the requirements for the scholarship application essay: The Personal Essay will be scored according to the applicant’s story (how he or she faced 

challenges in living with ADHD and met them) and insight about the applicant (interests, 

hobbies, community work, and career aspirations), in consideration of what it means to 

be brave and the Shire values of BRAVE—Bold, Resilient, Accountable, Visionary, and 

Ethical.

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_92_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_92_7.png)

Thus, students are expected to not just be “BRAVE” but also articulate how they overcame their specific challenges in a language that is in line with Shire’s company values. The rhetoric in this scholarship suggests that students are responsible for more than just good grades, but also a balanced social life, extracurricular activities and community service. In this way, Shire is not simply producing students who can achieve these goals with their help - rather, they are choosing to reward students who are already able to demonstrate their success so that they can serve as evidence of how well Shire’s products and affiliated service providers work together.

The alliance between Shire and The Edge foundation serves a particular function in constructing the responsible prescription drug user. It is a way for Shire to promote their support of complementary treatment modalities (e.g. education and coaching) via their relationship with The Edge Foundation. As a result, The Edge Foundation also gets a platform to promote ADHD awareness and the efficacy and necessity of their services to students. The responsible consumer is one that not only proactively seeks financial assistance from Shire, but appreciates the value and necessity of these services to their academic success. This point is illustrated in a news report from Global News, Canada, which highlights the experience of Zach Erickson, a 2014 winner of the Shire’s ADHD Scholarship Program in Canada.

**Reporter:** “Assignments, studying and exams. It’s a lot of pressure for any student. But 

add in Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder and it can feel unbearable.” 

**Erickson:** “I’m just an idiot, or I must be lazy, or I am just irresponsible.” 

**Reporter:** “Zach Erickson was diagnosed with ADHD during his third year of university 

and it hasn’t been an easy road.”

**Erickson:** “It’s something that you can very easily feel sorry for yourself for.” 

**Reporter:** “He’s now working on his last year of a degree in Neuroscience. The high 

pressure year has become bearable after being selected for the Shire ADHD Scholarship.” 

**Erickson:** “Working with my coach has just been developing strategies and habits to stay 

organized and stay on top of everything and just kind of basically be able to achieve the 

goals that I have set for myself.”

**ADHD expert:** “We find that many students that enter post-secondary with ADHD who 

don’t have a combination set up and don’t have someone to work with on this very often 

fail out first or second year.”

**Reporter:** “Erickson receives an hour of coaching each week over the phone. He says not 

only is it making a difference with his education, but his everyday life.”

**Erickson:** “It’s good to have the cash but the coaching is life changing. Coaching is good 

for one year but then being able to take what I’ve learned and apply it will be huge.” 

**Reporter:** “But in order for students to access help, the first step is for students to 

acknowledge the disorder. One that thousands of Canadians deal with every day without 

a diagnosis.”

**ADHD expert:** “Its one of the most common health conditions, so we are looking at 

almost 5% of children and 4% of adults and that’s the most conservative number.” 

**Erickson:** “Acknowledging that you have problem with something isn’t the same as 

using it as an excuse and it’s not the same as calling yourself as less than.” Testimonials from the ADHD scholarship winner, the ADHD expert and the reporter herself serve as powerful tools in Shire’s marketing armory. Each become a convincing mouthpiece for the company without ever mentioning prescription stimulants - in return, they are able to meet their own objectives of raising ADHD awareness, fighting stigma, and promoting coaching as an effective management strategy. However, the fact that the ADHD expert refers to a “combination” management plan subtly re-asserts the framework that drugs must be a part of the equation - but the responsibility to maximize their effects through coaching (made possible through engagement with the pharmaceutical industry) and perseverance is ultimately the responsibility of the contest winner. In this case, that is someone who is already in the final year of a neuroscience degree and can serve as a convincing spokesperson for Shire’s efforts in improving academic performance among college students.

**3.2.4  CPAMM: Delegating Responsibility** In this chapter, I have described at length how Shire’s marketing campaigns construct a vision of productive, empowering and responsible ADHD management - and the function of stimulants within that vision. I have also discussed how Shire is putting the responsibility of productive ADHD management and prescription drug use back into the hands of the consumer.

This strategy has been effective in redefining and re-delegating responsibility over preventing the 

irresponsible use of stimulant medications. With the increase in criticism over the medical, social 

and psychological dangers of prescription stimulants, Shire had no choice but to respond to 

allegations of irresponsible drug production and marketing.

When Vyvanse was first released in 2007, Shire claimed that the drug had a low 

likelihood of being abused because of its long acting nature as a pro-drug, unlike other 

stimulants, which had instant chemical effects (citation). However, a recent google search of the term “Vyvanse abuse” turns up almost 400,000 hits, suggesting that Shire’s original claim was pre-mature if not completely fabricated. Today, Shire has removed all materials with the original 

claim that Vyvanse is not habit-forming, and replaced them with clear warnings regarding its high potential for misuse and abuse. For example, ==when logging ==into ==vy==vanse.com==== the viewer is prompted with a warning before being able to access the main website. The language gives the 

impression that the drug is abused by some people who are already predisposed to addictive tendencies, such as alcoholism and street drugs. Telling the consumer to essentially hide their medications suggests that Shire is not accusing them of irresponsible use; rather, they are responsible for guarding their medication from others who might abuse it. This rhetoric is powerful because it puts the pharmaceutical industry and the consumer on the same side against the immoral, irresponsible drug user.

The Vyvanse website also features a 5-page guide titled “Proper Use of Prescription 

Stimulant Medication” which lays out the responsibility of the consumer to prevent “improper 

stimulant use.” They follow the FDA’s definition and describe misuse as using the medication in 

a way other than the way a doctor intended e.g. “Taking an extra pill of your own prescription because you think you need it” or “taking a friend’s stimulant for your own use”. They define 

83

###### Page 95

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_95_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_95_7.png)

abuse as taking a medication to get high or see how it makes you feel. They also describe 

diversion as anyone using a medication that does not have their name on the prescription bottle, 

including “giving your medication to a friend or taking medication from a sibling.” The brochure 

instructs patients to ask their doctor for instructions on what to do if they find themselves in a 

situation where they do not understand how to properly take their medication or for help preventing the misuse and abuse of stimulants among their loved ones. Shire ends the guide with the following statement:

Working Together to Ensure Proper Stimulant Use: We at Shire are dedicated to working 

with healthcare professionals and patients to help ensure the proper use of stimulant 

medications. We are committed to creating materials to help educate and promote the 

appropriate use of stimulant medications.

The guide is linked to a larger project initiated by Shire in 2014, titled “The Coalition to

Prevent ADHD Medication Misuse” (CPAMM). The project website features research and resources from a number of organizations invested in facilitating appropriate prescription 

stimulant use. This includes patient advocacy groups like CHADD and ADDA, as well as the American Academy of Family Physicians, and Student Affairs Administrators in Higher 

Education (NASPA). At the heart of these efforts is drawing a clear distinction between 

sanctioned responsible stimulant use, and the irresponsible use of stimulants among non­ prescribed users. According to the press release for the project,

Shire opposes the misuse, abuse and diversion of ADHD prescription stimulant 

medication and is committed to being a part of a solution to help prevent nonmedical use 

while preserving access to these important medications for those with a legitimate 

medical need. Shire recognizes that to create change we need collaborative solutions, 

which is why we’ve brought together this team of diverse and experienced experts and 

advocates (Gwen Fisher, Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Shire). Although the project is presented as a collaborative effort, it is important to note that “Shire is the sole funder of CPAMM [and] other partner organizations do not provide financial 

84

###### Page 96

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_96_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_96_7.png)

contributions to CPAMM.” Thus, although these other organizations support the stated mission of CPAMM, Shire ultimately controls the content and direction of the coalition. This is particularly important to consider when assessing CPAMM’s aim to “be a trusted source of information on the issue of ADHD prescription medication misuse, abuse and diversion - with a primary focus on college students.” Interestingly, at the time of this writing, the website only highlights three research articles as well as the results of only one Harris poll survey conducted on behalf of CPAMM. Ultimately, there is no way to know exactly who curated and approved the data presented on this page or what their intentions were.

The highlights of the Harris Poll survey were featured in a series of 1-3 minute videos on 

Shire’s YouTube Channel. In one video, we are addressed by Gwen Fisher, Senior Director of Corporate Communications for Shire. She opens with a long comment about Shire’s commitment to putting their consumer first and how the misuse of ADHD medications harms patients more than anyone else. She passionately explains that, “Ultimately we [Shire] believe that when people who don’t need ADHD stimulants take them, they trivialize a real psychiatric disorder and take medicines away from people who really need them.” This statement is significant because it pulls attention away from the inherent addictive qualities of the drug and the responsibility of the pharmaceutical company that produces them, while also reaffirming that their legally prescribed consumers still deserve access. However, when describing the troubling statistics from the Harris Poll survey, her tone becomes more relaxed as she refers to the data as insightful rather than alarming. The juxtaposition of her conviction towards protecting the consumer, and being apathetic about the people who illegally use the drug suggest their primary concern protecting their consumers’ rights to access medications rather than taking responsibility for the larger problem.

Upon watching these videos, it is difficult to tell who the intended audience would be. 

Despite their claim that this website is a vital resource for prescription stimulant misuse, it is unlikely that a college student would ever stumble upon CPAMM’s website or Shire’s YouTube 

Channel. Rather, it seems the entire purpose of this campaign is for Shire to officially condemn the misuse of their products and protect the rights of consumer, the legal stimulant user. If 

someone is concerned about what Shire is doing about this issue, Shire can point them to the website. The message presented to the viewer clearly indicates that the responsibility of preventing irresponsible stimulant use should be shared with the consumer, medical professionals and university administrators. By teaming up with these organizations, they are 

able to leverage their social capital and position themselves as a responsible drug company that 

facilitates responsible drug use. It is also worth mentioning that taking a stand against illegal 

stimulant use serves an understated benefit of gaining more legal consumers who will seek 

diagnoses and purchase their products legally. Given that many of the messages presented within these materials refers to diverting medications to family and friends, it is not unlikely that a 

consumer will encourage a loved one to obtain their own legal prescription. Doing so may make 

everyone feel like they are doing their part to be a responsible stimulant user who also facilitates the responsible use of others.

### **3.3  DISCUSSION**

Conrad and Potter (2005) note that in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the stimulant marketing landscape was heavily influenced by ideologies and processes related to the “shifting 

engines of medicalization” or biomedicalization. Attention disorders, once reserved for misbehaving children, were reformulated by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), 

86

###### Page 98

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_98_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_98_7.png)

advocacy groups, and drug marketers to accommodate the under-performing adults these 

children grew into. The emergence of DTC advertising provided a platform to present Adderall 

as a safe and effective means of liberation from the tyranny of Ritalin, a drug criticized as a form 

of medical social control wielded by the medical profession (Conrad 1975). As a lifestyle drug, Adderall catered to consumers who wanted to quickly, safely, and effectively fulfill their biomedical and social potentials. In this framework, ADHD diagnoses presented an opportunity to access these drugs and the transformations they promised.

My research suggests that in the last decade, the DTC stimulant marketing landscape has 

evolved significantly in response to pharmaceuticalization, resulting in social moment of moral breakdown for the American public. Mass increases in drugs sales coupled with media coverage 

of medical and social dangers of stimulants has lead the public to question the intentions of the pharmaceutical industry and the medical professionals who push their products on patients. The prevalence of drugs like Adderall that were once touted as a way to return the power of healing to patients now represented the infiltration of the pharmaceutical industry into the most intimate 

spheres of American life. Markets for non-medical ADHD treatment emerged and appealed to those consumers who were growing weary of the disempowering effects of prescription 

stimulants on their lives and society as a whole. Together, these factors contributed to an 

ongoing struggle between the pharmaceutical industry and its consumers to properly define ADHD and regulate the responsible use of prescription stimulants. In the following section, I 

discuss how Shire morally positioned themselves, their products, and their consumers in relation to this social moment of moral breakdown.

**3.3.1  Practices: From Selling Sickness to Supporting ADHD Management**

My research provides examples of how Shire has engaged in new forms of DTC marketing that enabled them to actively cultivate the needs of the evolving access-oriented 

consumer while also quelling the criticisms of the injury-oriented consumers (Abraham 2010). 

To do so, they constructed a relationship where producer and consumer inform and support each 

other in the united fight to manage ADHD. They hold a shared commitment to this responsibility, which requires both parties to play their part in making sure stimulants are in fact being consumed, but in a responsible way. It seems that one of Shire's goal’s in these campaigns was to shed the image of being a corporate drug pusher who is only interested in profits, becoming, instead, an expert ADHD advocate who empowers and protects its consumers. Shire 

accomplished this by assuming a number of dynamic roles through their DTC drug marketing 

campaigns.

In the “Own It” Initiative, we see Shire play the part of a pharmaceutical parent, or 

guardian, using tough love to convince their consumer that they need to own their condition and take their medication whether they like it or not. They used celebrities such as Adam Levine 

almost like “big brother” figures or mentors who are teaching consumers that it is okay to admit you need help - because once you do, the possibilities are endless. As a result, Shire is presented 

as helping the consumer make the tough choices and offering a hand to help them fight the 

struggles of ADHD. Ultimately, Shire is teaching its consumers how they should feel about ADHD and how to act accordingly.

In the “U Do the Rest” campaign, Shire built on their role as an ADHD expert, but one who will be there to help you manage your condition even after they have taken your money. 

The creation of websites, contests and other resources suggests that they understand the struggle 

88

###### Page 100

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_100_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_100_7.png)

of ADHD and can offer you an entire management plan that goes beyond selling you stimulant medication. By doing so, they set themselves apart in the prescription stimulant market by teaming up with other ADHD experts and offering a whole suite of resources and financial 

incentives to keep your loyalty. We also see this in Shire’s collection of college-specific resources and access to information about stimulant misuse. As a result, consumers and parents 

adopt Shire’s view of ADHD as well their view of college life and expectations of academic performance.

Finally, Shire assumed the role of protector, especially when it came to providing ADHD 

scholarships and taking a stand against the misuse of prescription stimulants. In the first case, 

Shire helps students with the financial burdens of pursuing higher educations and giving parents 

insider information on how to beat the complicated and often overwhelming college admissions process. With CPAMM, Shire brought together the collective power of their many allies to protect their patients against the harms caused by prescription stimulant abusers. This included the potential stigmas or pressures legal consumers might feel with consuming or diverting their medications. Shire made it clear that empowering their consumers (through resources, financial prizes, etc.) is their number one priority and, in return, they expect the consumer to fulfill their role in continuing to take their medication responsibly.

**3.3.2  Objects: From Lifestyle Drugs to Pharmaceutical Foundations**

The expiration of Adderall’s patent in 2008 presented Shire with an opportunity to repair the producer-consumer relationship and set themselves apart from generic brands now flooding the market. They accomplished this by repackaging ADHD treatment as a team-based experience 

and the function of prescription stimulants as its foundation. In these campaigns, Vyvanse is

89


---

###### Page 101

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_101_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_101_7.png)

being promoted as a foundational drug that places the agency over the drug and illness 

experiences back into the hands of the consumer. This is a departure from previous 

conceptualizations of stimulants as a form of medical social control wielded by doctors (Conrad

1975) and, more recently, as a magic bullet enhancement drug vended by drug companies to 

increase performance (Conrad 2000). I argue that in both these paradigms, stimulants embody the ultimate power to control or transform an individual’s mind, body, and social subjectivities. 

This is problematic for the consumer because a loss of agency, or dependency on the drug, may result in medical side effects, social stigma and possible addiction, making it less desirable to take the drug in the first place. It also calls into question the loyalties and motives of the pharmaceutical industry and physicians involved in the promotion and prescription of these powerful substances. Thus, if Adderall embodied the unrealistic and glorified pharmaceutical transformation - perfect grades, perfect relationships, perfect health, as described by Singh 

(2006) - Vyvanse embodied a more realistic and believable pharmaceutical experience. It is a 

drug that is powerful enough to address the neurochemical limitations of ADHD, yet not so powerful that it compromises the moral subjectivity of its user by fully controlling or transforming them.

Shire also offset the concerns over the misappropriation of stimulants by refraining Vyvanse and the like as a part of a larger, comprehensive ADHD management plan. Doing so 

dilutes the perceived power or control of the drug over the consumer and redistributes it among a number of treatments, such as behavior modification, therapy, coaching, and even the consumer himself. Accordingly, Shire allied with several private medical markets to promote this new treatment framework. In particular, this alliance benefited Shire because it replaced the heavily 

criticized relationship between the pharmaceutical companies and prescription providers (IOM 

90

###### Page 102

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_102_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_102_7.png)

2009). In many ways, ADHD specialists (researchers, therapists, coaches, educators, advocates) 

are more effective as spokespersons than private doctors because they are key contributors in the 

construction of ADHD in popular discourse. They often work directly with the public, raising 

awareness for the condition and potential treatments through local events, social media, websites 

and other promotional venues. They are not limited to the same legal measures and public 

scrutiny as the pharmaceutical industry when it comes to advertising and other forms of claimsmaking. Moreover, the goods and services they provide are often perceived to be a safer 

alternative to pharmacological treatments to ADHD, thus making them seem more cognizant of the needs and expectations of the modem medical consumer.

However, in light of their growing partnership with the pharmaceutical industry, treatments like coaching and behavioral modification therapy are not framed as alternatives but rather complementary to pharmacological treatments. My research suggests that private treatment providers may be enticed into alliances with Shire because it gives them the funding 

and venues to promote their services to large groups of consumers (via educational conferences, research funding, paid spokesmanships, etc.) They can return the favor by endorsing a neurobiological model of ADHD where prescription stimulants become the chemical foundation 

on which these other therapeutic modalities can take effect. Thus, I argue that presenting drugs 

like Adderall as part of a larger system of ADHD management does not necessarily take away their power as transformative magic bullets. In fact, it can multiply it by drawing on the 

influence of these complementary treatment modalities and the social capital of the individuals that promote them.

**3.3.3  Subjects: From Medical Consumers to Pharmaceutical Delegates**

Adderall emerged in the late 1990s in relation to the invention of what Applbaum (2006) terms the medical consumer, a neoliberal subject who empowers themselves through calculated pharmaceutical consumptions. However, changes in the last decade has reframed this pharmaceutical subject as a target of irresponsible pharmaceutical advertising, relying on drugs that ultimately marked them as cheaters or addicts. My research shows how Vyvanse has 

emerged in relation to the invention of what I term as the “pharmaceutical delegate,” a moralized 

subject who shares responsibility over ensuring responsible stimulant use with the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical delegate is depicted in these campaigns as someone who is both empowered by and responsible about prescription stimulant use. As in previous ads, they are depicted as someone who does not let ADHD get in their way of success and actively 

seeks professional and pharmaceutical help. Throughout these campaigns, Shire features 

individuals who are highly functioning and educated adults - like Megan M. the graduate student 

from the “Own It” contest and the dozens of winners of the Michael Yasick ADHD scholarship prize. This illustrates that anyone, even those who are academically successful, could meet the 

criteria for ADHD and benefit from the resources and medications provided by Shire.

Unlike previous advertisements, these campaigns depict the pharmaceutical delegate as 

someone who does not just own their ADHD, but also embraces it and promotes the diagnosis to 

others. Sharing quality testimonials through contest entries and scholarship prizes becomes a 

fundamental part of fulfilling the role of this responsible and engaged consumer. For example, in the ADHD scholarship campaign, consumers are rewarded if they are brave, or rather, if they can 

convince Shire that they ascribe to the same definition of bravery that is promoted on the 

company’s website. Moreover, they are already successful in school and have a well-rounded

background in extracurricular activities and community engagement. The ideal consumer is one who will not only take their medication to manage their ADHD, but use it to push themselves to the next level of success. They are willing to “do the rest” so that all the of the benefits of the medication are attributed to their hard work and the quality of Shire’s product - whereas any 

failures are due to the consumer not going the extra mile.

Finally, the pharmaceutical delegate is someone who cares about his or her family and 

friends and wants to prevent them from using Adderall illegally. They take the initiative to properly safeguard their prescription and take full responsibility if someone else illicitly uses their medication. The ideal consumer is someone who will seek information about misuse 

directly from the pharmaceutical company because they want to be informed by the source. They will encourage anyone in their life who uses medications illegally to seek professional care. This may help the person address an addiction problem, but it could also create an opportunity to seek 

legal access by obtaining their own prescription. Finally, the pharmaceutical delegate is someone who will only use the medication as prescribed, but if they do not, they understand that it is their responsibility to work with a medical professional in dealing with the consequences of their misuse. They appreciate the information the pharmaceutical industry has provided and will act 

accordingly to share that message with others and use it to create a personalized management plan with their doctors.

### **3.4  CONCLUSION**

In this chapter, I provided evidence to investigate the ongoing struggle between the pharmaceutical industry and its consumers to properly define ADHD and regulate the responsible use of prescription stimulants. I examine this struggle as a social moment of moral 

93

###### Page 105

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_105_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_105_7.png)

breakdown associated with the biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization of performance in American culture. I take this as a departure from previous conceptualizations of the neoliberal informed medical consumer who feels empowered through pharmaceutical marketing (Applbaum 2006). As Singh (2006) points out, DTC advertising of Adderall in the early 2000s focused on the idealized and instantaneous transformation it afforded. This perspective both appealed and contributed to medical neoliberalism at the turn of the century as described by Fisher and Ronald (2008), by putting the control over health back in the hands of the consumer rather than the authority of medical professionals. My findings suggest that Shire still relies heavily on traditional tactics of creating and perpetuating disease categories by personalizing risks, motivating diagnoses and creating branded compliance (Dumit 2011). However, they have situated these tactics within a rhetoric of responsibility alongside empowerment.

These case examples suggest that Shire has teamed up with other ADHD experts to create new forms of moralized and engaged consumerism founded on the goal of responsible stimulants consumption. In the process, the symbolic meaning of stimulants has been reformulated as an empowerment drug rather than a controversial performance enhancer or form of medical social control. They have also constructed what appears to be a clear distinction between responsible and irresponsible stimulant use based on legal and sanctioned access as determined by collaborations between patients and their doctors. As a result, Shire has delegated both the benefits and burdens of the drug back to the consumer and the medical professionals who are charged with prescribing and monitoring their use. I argue that by doing so, consumers are now given the responsibility to diligently consume stimulant medications while also promoting the responsible use of others.

In the following chapter, I consider how these moral discourses are transmitted and 

94

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_106_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_106_7.png)

transformed as prescription stimulants are materialized in the context of ADHD diagnosis and treatment. I examine the experiences of health service providers and professional ADHD experts who are tasked with defining and distinguishing students who are eligible for access to treatment 

and ensuring that prescription stimulants are used responsibly. It also speaks to their positionality 

in regards to the pharmaceutical industry and how it influences their perceptions of prescription 

stimulants and their relationships with ADHD college students.

**CHAPTER 4: TREATMENT**

This chapter considers how moral ideologies are filtered from the DTC prescription 

stimulant marketing landscape and absorbed in the modem treatment landscape to inform 

definitions of responsible stimulant use in the college environment. It builds on anthropological 

literature that describes the expert patient, a neoliberal subject who empowers themselves by 

actively pursuing medical treatment. I examine the potential for diagnosis, treatment and 

accommodation of ADHD to trigger moments of moral breakdown where both doctors and patients deploy a number of strategies to maintain agency over the exchange. This includes 

strategies that range from to rigorous testing, to pharmaceutical detox, to malingering, to doctor 

shopping. Accordingly, it becomes the responsibility of the patient to actively pursue access to 

stimulants and consume them responsibly.

I build on this literature and consider how the stimulant treatment of ADHD has evolved in respect to trends in pharmaceuticalization over the last decade. Increases in diagnostic rates and the prevalence of illicit stimulant use have raised public concerns over the intentions and actions 

of health service providers who over-facilitate or deny access to ADHD services. I use media reports to provide key insights into public discourse surrounding this social moment of moral breakdown and highlight the ethical dilemmas faced by health service providers. I situate these 

dilemmas within the evolving ADHD treatment landscape described in Chapter 2 and illustrate how certain factors such as evolving diagnostic criteria for adult ADHD, lack of confirmatory testing, and competing treatment modalities have reshaped the doctor-patient relationship.

My goal in this chapter is to explore how health service providers at American State University have positioned themselves, their services, and their patients in relation to both social 

and personal moments of moral breakdown within the modem treatment landscape. To

accomplish this, I engaged in informal interactions with a variety of experts that engage with U.S. college students across a number of social settings. This included participation in two ADHD conferences sponsored by Shire Pharmaceuticals; two academic disabilities conferences; four group meetings with the American State counseling program; and a series of ADHD coach training classes. I present six case examples that highlight moments from these interactions in which health service providers and ADHD experts positioned themselves in response to concerns around ADHD treatment and framed their decisions to promote or discourage stimulant use as acts of social responsibility. The case examples are organized around three overlapping contexts in which health service providers lay claims to authority over the responsible treatment of the condition: medical expertise, cultural expertise, and educational expertise. I present my analyses of these case examples around the practices-subjects-objects framework to systematically map the moral discourses that surround and are produced through the modem diagnosis, treatment and accommodation of ADHD. I conclude the chapter with a discussion of how this analysis informs conceptions and expectations of pharmaceutical morality and subjectivity among US college students.

### **4.1  MORAL BREAKDOWN: PUSHING DRUGS OR DENYING TREATMENT**

Despite the fact that students with ADHD are less likely than their peers to graduate from high school and attend college, it is estimated that approximately 2-9% of the U.S. college population is diagnosed with the condition (Dupal et al. 2009). Studies indicate that these individuals make up 25% of college students receiving university disabilities services and this number is on the rise (Dupal et al. 2009). For advocates of the condition, the increase in ADHD students attending college signals a growing need for services and accommodations to help these 

97

###### Page 109

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_109_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_109_7.png)

individuals achieve a successful college experience (Hinshaw 2014). At the same time, the rise in 

students attempting to access ADHD treatments has raised significant public concerns over the 

legitimacy of this disorder and its implications of increasing the availability of stimulant medications on campus. As a result, campus health providers and administrators are faced with the dilemma of potentially facilitating the increased availability of stimulants on campus or 

failing to accommodate the health needs of their students.

Media commentaries on these concerns offer key insights into how Americans are responding to the increase of ADHD diagnoses and stimulant use on college campuses as a 

social moment of moral breakdown. For example, on April 20 2013, New York Times reporter Alan Schwartz published another installment in his series of critiques on ADHD and stimulant 

culture in the United States. It was titled "Attention-Deficit Drugs Face New Campus Rules" and 

focused on the detrimental impacts illicit Adderall use was having on those students who needed the drug for medical purposes. He began the piece describing the difficulty a student named Lisa had trying to obtain a prescription for Adderall from the student health center at California State University, Fresno. According to the article, Lisa “endured over two months of testing” for ADHD and was only given a prescription after signing a contract agreeing not to share her medication with anyone else. In addition to contracts, Fresno State also does not allow early refills to replace lost or stolen medication and reserves the right to administer urine tests should a university clinician suspect stimulant misuse. All students receiving prescription for ADHD treatments through the university are also required to see a Fresno State therapist for one hour 

each month to ensure proper use. Campus counselor Dr. Daniel Little explained, “It’s not just taking a pill every day... It’s about learning coping skills.”

Schwartz quoted a Fresno State official who state that these measures were a response to 

98

###### Page 110

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_110_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_110_7.png)

the “disquieting surge of students requesting A.D.H.D. diagnoses — along with news media reports of stimulant abuse and questionable diagnostic practices nationwide.” Catherine Felix, the director of Health and Psychological services was also quoted saying that the university no 

longer makes diagnoses, largely because of the substantial time required “to do it right.” This 

sentiment also stemmed from the number of legal cases over the last decade of parents who have 

sued the University health centers for malpractice after their children were prescribed stimulants 

after only one appointment. Today, Fresno state is one of several institutions including North 

Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Penn State, who also said they could no longer handle the volume of ADHD diagnosis requests and were, as one health director put it, “getting out of the ADHD business.” Schwarz stated that these policies are ADHD-specific and tend not to apply to 

other psychiatric conditions. He quoted Ruth Hughes, chief executive director of CHADD, who 

said that such rules create “a culture of fear and stigma,” around ADHD and that if students need to sign a contract to obtain stimulants, they should have to do so for other controlled substances, 

such as painkillers.

Schwartz suggests that because of these new rules, many students are encouraged to see their private family doctors to seek out a diagnosis. After obtaining official documentation 

outside the university, they can then conveniently have the student health center fill their prescriptions. According to the article, diagnosis “typically involves hours of neuropsychological testing and conversations with parents and teachers to assess impairment and other possible 

explanations.” Students must either comply with these rules or fill their prescriptions elsewhere 

and bring them back to campus.

Despite these restrictions, Adderall is still widely available and students like Lisa 

continue to be solicited for their medications by fellow students. Critics like Hughes argue that

“If a university is very concerned about stimulant abuse, I would think the worst thing they could do is to relinquish this responsibility to unknown community practitioners... Non-prescribed use of stimulant medications on campus is a serious problem that can’t just be punted to someone else outside the school grounds.” Schwarz also quoted several students who supported Hughes statement and bragged that any university efforts to prevent illicit Adderall use would be futile.

In the article, Schwarz questioned the logic of putting students through such strict policies to obtain their medications. He quoted one university health official who admitted “We get complaints that you’re making it hard to get treatment.. .there’s some truth to that... [but] the counterweight is these prescriptions can be abused at a high rate, and we’re not willing to be a part of that and end up with kids sick or dead.” While Fresno State is working on cutting off the Adderall supply on campuses, other Universities like Duke have targeted the illegal users through rules that incorporate “the unauthorized use of prescription medication to enhance academic performance” as a category of academic dishonesty. At the same time, Schwarz quoted one Vanderbilt student who laughs at the policy and states “I don’t think they’re doing enough to stop people like me.”

These concerns outlined in Schwarz’s critical commentary are part of a growing tension among ADHD service providers, campus administration, and college students around the fair assessment, treatment and accommodations of ADHD. It has emerged as the result of a number of factors that shape this new treatment landscape, such as evolving diagnostic criteria for adult ADHD, a lack in confirmatory testing, increase in prescription stimulant demands and competing treatment modalities for the condition. In this chapter, I examine how ADHD services providers at American State University have positioned themselves in order to navigate this morally convoluted environment. Specifically, I ask, how is responsible stimulant use defined and

facilitated by the ADHD experts and patients through the diagnosis, treatment, and management? 

How do these interactions influence and embody shifting expectations around the responsibility 

of US college students to facilitate and participate in responsible stimulant use? In the following 

sections, I explore these questions and investigate how service providers at my field site frame ADHD treatment, the function of stimulants, and the role of the responsible patient in relation to these social and personal moments of moral breakdown.

### **4.2  CASE EXAMPLES**

To better understand this landscape, I interacted with ADHD experts across a number of 

social and professional settings. Initially I did not set out to interview these individuals, rather I wanted to observe how expert discourses about ADHD and stimulants were being constructed 

and disseminated to patients at educational events. This included participation in two ADHD 

conferences sponsored by Shire Pharmaceuticals and two Disabilities Services in Higher 

Education conferences. It was after these public presentations that I interacted with these experts 

one-on-one and built rapport, asking more in-depth, informal questions pertaining to my research. Additionally, I attended four private group meetings with various health and disabilities 

services programs at American State which were followed by group and individual discussions 

about the proper management of ADHD students. I also attended a number of ADHD coach training classes while in the field. I had learned about the program during my participation at one 

of the ADHD conferences and applied for a fellowship to complete the training for a discounted price. This experience provided an intimate perspective on the training these experts receive on ADHD and prescription stimulants, and how they are expected to interact and market themselves to potential clients. As a result of these diverse experiences, I gained a relatively broad scope of 

101

###### Page 113

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_113_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_113_7.png)

the evolving ADHD treatment landscape.

These interactions reveal that the treatment of ADHD on college campuses has become a 

deeply moralized negotiation of health, empowerment, and responsibility by which social and biomedical subjectivities are fashioned. The significance of these transactions is bolstered by the 

fact that the demand for ADHD diagnosis, treatment, and accommodations have become a normal part of the college experience for many students. So much so that American State had to 

open an ADHD testing center to accommodate the needs of these students, while also maintaining a sense of responsibility over the medical, social, and academic well-being of the 

entire student body. Often, these objectives conflicted with each other as ADHD experts 

struggled to provide treatment to those who needed it, while also preventing access to those who would use it irresponsibly. This problem was compounded by the fact that each expert worked within the same setting yet had different definitions of what promoting responsible use and preventing irresponsible use meant.

The notion of being an “expert” service provider was understood and expressed by my 

informants through a number of personal and professional discourses. While some pointed towards their professional training and certifications, others felt their years of experience or natural intuition meant that they were best able to distinguish those who had ADHD and those who did not. Others pointed towards their personal experience with the condition and claimed that there was no way a non-ADHD person could know what the condition looked like or felt 

like. However, most of these experts relied on a combination of these forms of evidence to 

construct their expert subjectivity and rationalize their authority in managing ADHD. At the heart of these arguments was how these experts positioned themselves around prescription 

stimulants as healing medications and/or dangerous substances. While none of the experts I 

102

###### Page 114

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_114_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_114_7.png)

spoke with outright objected to the use of prescription stimulants in public, they each seemed to 

express a clear view of how these objects either contributed to or detracted from their ability to 

successfully treat ADHD.

The experts I spoke with drew on a combination of medical, social and academic logics to ultimately make their decision on whether or not to facilitate the diagnosis, treatment or 

accommodations of ADHD. While each claimed to follow a strict protocol to make these 

decisions, at least three of the experts I spoke with admitted to treating a client even though they 

“probably didn’t have ADHD.” For example, Dr. Edwards, a private psychiatrist told me that he had a college student/patient whom he knew was buying Adderall illegally from his friends to 

increase his academic performance. He explained that he was worried that the student would get 

in trouble with the law or start to abuse the medication so it was in his best interest to give him a prescription so that he could “at least supervise his use.”

Another expert, Tom, an ADHD coach, told me about one of his clients who likely also 

did not have the condition but was still benefiting from his services. When I asked him if his 

client knew he probably did not have ADHD, Tom told me that in his opinion, “it does not matter what you call it, if he needs the label to finally feel brave enough to seek help, what is the problem?” On the other hand, Betty, a woman who worked within the disabilities services center 

at American State told me that she was skeptical of many of the students who came in with 

evidence for ADHD. However, she still provided them with accommodations because she could not disprove their diagnosis. In contrast, the rest of the professionals I interacted with vehemently claimed to only diagnose/treat/accommodate those students who “needed it.” It is these distinctions that would both socially and subjectively set them apart from “irresponsible” ADHD experts like Dr. Edwards, Tom and Betty.

In the following sections, I present six case examples of professionals who represent the various forms of expertise I encountered within the ADHD treatment landscape. This includes an ADHD advocate, an ADHD coach, a private medical doctor, a university psychologist, an 

academic program coordinator and a university disabilities specialist. While each professional 

shared in the concerns listed above, the ways in which they strategically positioned themselves in the treatment landscape and around prescription drugs varied notably. Each constructed a persona which served to ethically rationalize their decisions to support or deny ADHD treatment, 

and illustrates the complex value systems they constructed out of necessity. By coupling data 

from public professional presentations and more intimate interactions, the following cases show how expert’s moralized self-constructions compared to their lived experiences as ADHD treatment providers.

**4.2.1  ADHD Advocate: Responsibility to Optimize Management**

In October of 2014,1 attended the 14th Annual Calvin Scott Memorial ADHD conference 

(pseudonym) at a small community college close to my primary field site. I had read about it in a 

local newspaper and saw it as an opportunity to see firsthand how knowledge about the disorder was constructed and distributed at these educational events. I was especially enticed by the 

discounted registration price for students, and intended to speak with individuals about their 

interest in ADHD research. When I arrived that morning, I was impressed by the turn out. 

Clusters of eager parents, therapists, teachers and students were lined up at the registration table, 

filling out name tags, gathering pamphlets and filling up on complimentary coffee. Once I had wrestled my way through the crowd, I took my seat in the main auditorium and began thumbing through the lofty welcome packet. It was filled with information one might expect from 

104

###### Page 116

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_116_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_116_7.png)

conference organizers: a schedule for the day, biographies of each presenter, and speaker evaluation forms. There was also a dozen or so brightly colored advertisements for local ADHD services, including self-help books, neurofeedback therapy, productivity coaching, and information for teachers hoping to earn continuing education credits (CECs) from their participation in the conference.

After a few minutes, the lights started to dim and the master of ceremony took the stage. Behind her, the projector powered up to illuminate the dark room. Two large logos of equal size filled the screen. On the left side, written in muted letters inside a gold medallion was the name of the conference. Next to it, in bright blue letters was the logo for Shire Pharmaceuticals. The text read “14th Annual Calvin Scott AD/HD Conference is supported by Shire: to be as brave as the people we help.” Beneath was a statement explaining, “This educational activity is supported by an independent medical education grant from Shire.” The audience sat silently for a moment, carefully reading the words on the screen, as the master of ceremony took the microphone and declared, “Welcome to the 14th Annual Calvin Scott ADHD Conference! Thank you so much for being here today! And a special thanks to our friends at Shire for making this amazing event possible!” The audience erupted into applause.

After a brief explanation of the history of the conference and some highlights of the events to come, she introduced the keynote speaker, Monica Evans. Ms. Evans was touted as a “best­ selling author, speaker, classroom teacher, school psychologist, mental health counselor, local and state level mental health administrator, lobbyist and executive director of a statewide mental health advocacy organization, and national mental health consultant on children's issues. Perhaps, more importantly, she is also the mother of two grown sons and a daughter with ADHD.” Ms. Evans took the stage and began her slide show presentation titled “ADHD and

105

###### Page 117

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_117_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_117_7.png)

Executive Functioning,” which promised to be a neurological exploration into the condition. 

However, she started her slide show with an image of what appeared to be her extended family 

of parents, siblings, children, and grandchildren dressed in all white in front of their home. She turned to the audience and announced proudly, “Moms, dads, I know what you are going through. This is my family and every single person in this photo has been diagnosed with ADHD.” I looked around the room to see if others shared in my visceral skepticism over her 

statement and was surprised to see quite a different reaction - sympathy. Ms. Evans continued with a personal story about her son Adam who had a hard time concentrating in school as a young boy. She recounted a moment when she sent him to get a pen from the home office and 

she found him “staring at the dog drinking water” in the kitchen five minutes later. She took this to be a critical sign and eventually had him tested and diagnosed with ADHD.

Over the next hour, Ms. Evans moved into the neurobiological origins and effects of ADHD on executive functioning. She cited a number of scientific studies which indicated that 

individuals with the condition are actually three years behind in emotional and psychological 

development and that it is not their fault they are not performing to their full potential. She used the phrase “brain chemistry” to describe the complex neurobiological functions responsible for this deficit and argues that medication works for 75-90% of those with the condition. She also 

informed the audience that the condition is genetic and encouraged parents to get themselves tested for the condition if they related to any of the adult symptoms she has listed.

Ms. Evans then proceeded to show the audience a fifteen-minute clip from a video that she had produced with her son Adam, who had since graduated from college, on being a student with ADHD. The clip showed a series of interviews with students and ADHD experts who explained the necessity of stimulant medication to treating the condition. One student explained that before 

106

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_118_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_118_7.png)

she took the medication, she would get to the bottom of the stairs of her apartment and forget why she went downstairs in the first place. A doctor on the film explained that these challenges 

are “unnecessary” because “we have medicines that treat the dopamine receptors and slow down the chemicals” so people can stay focused on their goals. After the clip, Ms. Evans reiterated to the audience that ADHD is not an excuse for poor performance, it is a neurobiological 

explanation for it. She at one point compared trying to deal with ADHD without medication to 

“tying to tie your shoes with one hand tied behind your back. You could do with, but why not just untie your hand?” She then reiterated that while medicines help with focus, but what one 

does with that focus is up to the individual. Ms. Evans also told the audience that if they or their 

child take medication and people around them notice an increase in their performance, they 

should just take the compliment and not mention the medication because “it is you that is doing the real work” and that the medicine just helps to “focus the chemistry in your brain so it works better.”

During the last ten minutes of her presentation, the tone changed as Ms. Evans started to promote her business and the products she has developed to help parents and ADHD adults. She 

showed us her website with a series of videos on ADHD that one can purchase for $35-$50, as well as a giant poster of an iceberg that shows the hidden symptoms and costs of ADHD most people do not know about. She finished the talk by inviting her husband up on stage to show their united front against ADHD and then announced that they would be raffling off one of her best selling books on the topic. She told the audience to check under their seat to locate the lucky winner - it was a mother of two children who was delighted to win the prize. By the end of the presentation, the audience seemed primed to experience the rest of the conference.

**4.2.2  ADHD Coach: Responsibility to Personalize Management**

During my participation in the ADHD conference, I had learned about a coaching certification program that would be offered the following spring. The certification was for general life coaching but offered a specialization in ADHD coaching for those who were willing to pay for the extra credits. When I found out they were offering fellowships to obtain the certification at a discounted price, I signed up to hoping to gain an insider perspective into the 

evolving emergent market of ADHD coaching for college students.

The class was run via teleconference and was mediated by one of the foremost ADHD 

experts in the field, Dr. Alexander Marin. Not surprisingly, we were required to purchase his book as our primary text for the course. Like many specialization courses, this one was only offered four times a year and as a result, filled up relatively quickly. In fact, the interest was so high that he decided to accept double the students (and double the funds) and break the class into Tuesday and Wednesday groups to accommodate everyone. The course was set up around a 

series of modules that focused on a particular dimension of having ADHD and/or how to market one’s ADHD coaching business. Each class started with a roll call and about 20 minutes of lecture from Dr. Marin, in which he would talk about the day's topic through reference to research and personal anecdotes from his own clientele. The next 20 minutes were dedicated to discussing a prepared case study from a fellow student that he would send out to the class ahead of time. These were based on a real challenge they were facing with a client. This was possible because at least 40% of the class were practicing ADHD coaches without any official certification because it is not required by law to be certified. The final ten minutes were spent 

asking Dr. Marin lingering questions we had about the lecture, the case study or just picking his brain on how to deal with our own ADHD challenges.

During the first class, Dr. Marin made it clear to everyone that coaching was much different from therapy or consulting. It was not our responsibility to “fix” our clients, but instead, empower them by using a positive psychology or strength’s based approach. He explained, “As coaches, we do not treat the disorder, we help them manage their lives, increase self awareness and help them research their goals. We still need to consider that they have this disorder while we are coaching them.” This perspective was critical to setting the ideal relationship between the coach and the client - one that is both empowering and personalized.

Dr. Marin then moved into a historical overview of what he refers to as “The Great ADHD Debate,” between two camps of ADHD experts, most notably Dr. Ned Hallowell and Dr. Russell Barkley. He explained that Hallowell and company believed that ADHD should not be considered a disorder because it is disempowering to the client. They encourage coaches to see their clients as empowered individuals who happen to interact with the world in a different way, and as a result may face some obstacles. Alternatively, Barkley and company believed that coaches should absolutely approach ADHD as a legitimate disorder that deserved special attention. They argue that without the official label, clients will not have the leverage to request or receive special accommodations or access to medications. This would prevent them from being successful in their personal and professional lives. Dr. Marin discussed the pros and cons of each side and ultimately advised the class that the best approach is to have a “realistic optimism” about the condition so that our clients feel good about receiving the treatment they might need.

Interestingly, stimulants only came up in passing during class when students described the background of their case study clients and any potential medications they were on. However, about midway through the course, Dr. Marin presented a module called “The Neurobiology of

109

###### Page 121

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_121_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_121_7.png)

ADHD” which included a primer on ADHD medications. He began by going over a series of simplified diagrams of the prefrontal cortex of brain that we could use to explain the science of the condition to our clients. He then switched to a number of cartoons that illustrated how this neurobiology translated into behaviors - this included a screenshot of the famous cartoon “ADHD dog” from the Disney movie “Up” that is easily distracted by a passing squirrel. The students in the class were amused and many of them said they have used that example when describing ADHD to their friends and family. Dr. Marin’s ultimate point was that it was our job to use these visuals to show our clients that there was a neurological explanation for their challenges.

With about 10 minutes of lecture time remaining, Dr. Marin finally approached the topic of ADHD medications. He explained that 50-70% of ADHD clients also exhibit symptoms of co­ existing conditions, such as oppositional defiance disorder, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, or some type of learning disability. As a result, medication would be necessary for many of our clients, but only as part of a larger comprehensive treatment plan. This included coaching to encourage a productive environment, a time management plan, and other ADHD-specific structures that would help clients manage their ADHD symptoms. He cited a lecture from last year’s CHADD conference that was presented by behavior psychologist that compared the benefits of medication against coaching with two groups of ADHD patients. According to this study, after the first year, the group on medication outperformed the group who only received coaching. However, after the first year, each subsequent year the group who received coaching continued to surpass the performance of those who were treated with medication alone. This meant that although we were to acknowledge the value of medications for our clients, it was only in the context of a holistic treatment plan centered on ADHD coaching. Dr. Marin explained it 

110


---

###### Page 122

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_122_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_122_7.png)

was our responsibility to make sure our clients understood that medication should never replace 

coaching entirely.

The final ten minutes of the lecture was dedicated to a hyper-condensed overview of the various medications that have been prescribed to treat ADHD over the last fifty years. This 

included the chemical names and brand names of the drugs, as well as a quick evaluation of what he thought about the drug. For example, he told us that “no one really uses Ritalin anymore because of the embarrassment factor” and that “Focalin is great because it’s half the power of 

Ritalin with the same effectiveness.” He also explained that a number of non-stimulant medications such as Strattera which were once thought to be effective really are not because “it takes a while to build up in your system.” However, as a result, such medications are less likely to be abused. Dr. Marin contended that stimulants like Adderall and Vyvanse were the most 

common and effective and, as a result, we should make sure our clients consider those as 

alternatives to less effective forms of medications. When he asked the class if we had any 

questions, a few asked him to compare the benefits of one drug over another. Dr. Marin quickly responded with a ranking, placing Vyvanse at the top. It was rare that the students ever 

questioned his authority on this or other ADHD related matters and it was likely that many took his word at face value.

According to Dr. Marin, it was part of the coach’s responsibility to make sure we helped 

our clients become advocates for their own health. He explained that it was common for patients to not remember to take their medications, are not on high enough dosages, or experience serious 

side effects - yet fail to communicate these concerns to their doctor. Thus, it was our responsibility to help them manage their medications to maximize their benefits while avoiding the potential negative side effects. This included strategies such as role playing with our clients

we were would pretend to be the physician, or help them learn what kinds of resources are 

available at school or in the workplace. Ultimately, medication management should become a part of the coach’s purview because our clients may not know if and when to ask questions or 

seek help when treating their ADHD. Throughout this training, I could not help but wonder how many of my classmates would feel that this 20-minute lecture provided enough knowledge for them to successfully and safely advise their patients on something as potentially serious as medication management.

**4.2.3  Private Medical Doctor: Responsibility to Optimize Treatment**

It was the first break out session of the Calvin Scott Memorial ADHD conference and I was sitting in a well-equipped, stadium style lecture hall ready to listen to the next presentation, 

“ADHD: Finding Effective Medication Therapy for Children and Adults.” The presenter was Dr. 

Jason Phillips, a Harvard trained M.D./Ph.D. in his late thirties who owns a local private practice. He wore an expensive suit and spoke with an ivy league confidence as he started the presentation with a slide outlining two disclosures: “I have no significant financial interest or 

other relationship with the manufacturers of the products discussed in my presentation” and 

“Data from personal research was funded by institutional funds from the Pediatric 

Psychopharmacology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital.” In other words, he was an unbiased expert that we could trust.

Dr. Phillips began the presentation with an overview of the prevalence of ADHD in the United States. He explained to the audience that although nearly nine million people in the U.S. 

likely have the condition and “as many as 8 million adults with ADHD are not receiving pharmacologic treatment.” Dr. Phillips then presented a number of slides illustrating the 

112


---

###### Page 124

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_124_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_124_7.png)

consequences of untreated adult ADHD, which included lower income levels, inability to complete high school or college, potential for drug abuse, car accidents, incarceration, and becoming divorced. He also had a slide emphasizing the likelihood of these consequence which included warnings such as, “without treatment, you are four times more likely to contract a sexually transmitted disease.”

Dr. Philips moved on to defining ADHD as a highly heritable, life long, neurobiological condition, thus, “when you diagnose ADHD in a child, you always look for it in the parent.” He spent a significant amount of time explaining how childhood symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity and/or impulsivity manifest differently in adults and that this is recognizable by a good doctor. Many adults, he explained, think their symptoms are caused by other psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depression or even learning disorders, which challenges diagnoses. However, ADHD often appears as comorbidities with other psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, or learning disorders, so it is important to test for ADHD if you suffer from any of these other conditions. Dr. Phillips also explained that many adults do not experience severe symptoms because they compensate by choosing a job or spouse that helps them cope with their ADHD without even realizing it. However, he emphasized that medication can inevitably help improve the symptoms of ADHD and should be considered as potential course of treatment.

Next, Dr. Phillips provided into an in-depth overview of the various types of stimulant and nonstimulant treatments that are available on the market, as well as some figures on their proven efficacy. After the overview, he turned to the audience and said, “even though the sponsors of this conference probably want me to tell you that their drugs are the best, the truth is that all classes of stimulant work well.” Thus, the important thing was to get on the medication, no 

113

###### Page 125

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_125_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_125_7.png)

matter what brand. Dr. Phillips then explained that while the FDA provided dosing guidelines based on height and weight (~68mg/1001bs), it was important to work with your doctor to 

optimize the drug’s effects. He used the quote “start low, but don’t go slow” to emphasize the 

importance of regular increases in dosage and working with a doctor to monitor the progress. He 

showed a slide titled “Goals of ADHD Therapy” which had a chart with an ascending line, a 

slight drop, and a then another quick ascension off the screen. The words underneath read “Treat the core impairments. Don’t stop at just partial symptom improvement. Aim for the normative range.” Dr. Phillips explained that many doctors stop increasing treatment before “a patient’s target symptoms continue to improve without side effects.”

Lastly, Dr. Phillips introduced the results from his own clinical study in which he 

administered more than double the suggested FDA limit and found acceptable tolerance, blood pressure levels, and no indication of chemical toxicity. As long as the patient can tolerate the side 

effects of the medications, he did not see any reason to discontinue the treatment. He concluded his presentation by reminding the audience that medication should always be the “first line of therapy” and that “medications are not without risk, but those risks can be managed.”

**4.2.4  University Psychologist: Responsibility to Personalize Treatment**

I first met Dr. Nicholson when I attended his talk at a statewide Disabilities in Higher 

Education Conference hosted at American State University in 2012. The title of his presentation was “ADHD Crises: An Interdisciplinary Approach to Supporting Students with Academic 

Performance Concerns." It was the result of a collaborative effort between Student Counseling 

Services (SCS), the Student Health Center (SHC), the Disabilities Resources Center (DSC) and the Center for Psychiatry at American State.

114

###### Page 126

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_126_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_126_7.png)

The first slide of the presentation was titled “A scene from scholarly pursuits” and 

featured a cartoon of a student sitting at his desk, distracted by all of the minutia in his room. Dr. Nicholson told the audience that attention issues are a part of the college experience for many 

students but that does not always indicate ADHD. This was especially important to consider when understanding why the number of students requesting diagnoses for the condition has 

increased dramatically over the last eight years. Before 2008, he explained, the Student Health 

Center was bombarded with what they called “ADHD crises” - desperate students looking for a 

doctor’s note to explain a late paper or poor score on an exam. Because they were not equipped to handle this volume, students were diagnosed and prescribed medications without proper 

assessments. The head of the psychiatry department contacted Dr. Nicholson, who had over 

fifteen years of assessment experience before he joined American State, and asked if he could 

start a structured ADHD testing clinic to provide referrals. He agreed, and with the joint efforts 

of various campus units that dealt with ADHD students, they developed a system to properly test, treat and accommodate ADHD students. In the first year, only 28% of students tested for ADHD received a diagnosis, 60% were diagnosed with another psychiatric condition, and 12% were within the normal range. He explained that it was the responsibility of university health personnel to distinguish the difference between real medical issues and college students placing unreasonable academic expectations upon themselves.

Over the next 24 months, Dr. Nicholson and I became well acquainted and talked often 

about the challenges of diagnosing and treating college students with ADHD. During one of our 

early conversations, he described the assessment process. This included an initial intake 

conversation; followed by a recommendation for a full assessment (two days of testing which 

cost around $1000 to complete); an evaluation of personal histories from the student and close 

115

###### Page 127

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_127_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_127_7.png)

family members; and, finally, an informing session where he would review the results of the testing. If the student tested positive for ADHD, he would write a referral to the Student Health 

Center, at which point they could seek pharmaceutical treatment. He told me that during the 

initial intake, he could usually tell if a student's attention issues were normal, indicative of ADHD or due to another underlying factor.

Sometimes, he explained, students would admit to him that they have taken a friend’s Adderall and it “worked” for them. Although he knew that this alone was not “grounds for a positive diagnosis,” it is hard to convince a student of this fact. He said, “when I have to tell them that in my professional opinion they don’t have ADHD, and that their lack of focus is normal or worse, that it is due to depression or bipolar, they get visibly upset... it’s like they 

don’t want to deal with the real problem, they just want the Adderall.” Although he might try to 

save them the $1000 testing fee, sometimes a student was adamant that they needed the testing 

and he would go along with it. He felt that it would allow him to work with the student to really 

get to the heart of the problem and in most cases, which some students really appreciate. I asked him if he felt that students ever tried to cheat on the assessments and fake ADHD. He laughed 

and told me “of course, but we have ways to detect for malingering. Of course I can’t tell you what those are. They are trade secrets!”

In a recent conversation with Dr. Nicholson, he told to me that the number of students requesting assessments at the university had dropped significantly in the last year or so. When I 

asked him why he thought this had happened, he told me that it is because students have caught 

on that he does not just hand out ADHD referrals and are probably going to other doctors to 

obtain legal access to Adderall. He explained that most primary care physicians are unable to perform rigorous assessments on their patients and, as a result, give out strong medications to

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_128_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_128_7.png)

people who may not have ADHD or may need treatment for a different psychiatric condition. 

This is different from the approach he takes, which he explains as “diagnosis by exclusion of all 

other explanations.” This is especially the case when students do not have a history of ADHD 

symptoms from childhood, or are only concerned with academic performance issues. He told me that if and when he does diagnose the condition, he makes sure to thoroughly explore all of the treatment options with his patients, of which medication is only one possibility. Although it is ultimately up to the patient and the prescribing physician or psychiatrist to determine the course 

of treatment, he feels that it is his responsibility to prepare them for that conversation. He uses the phrase "pills don’t teach skills" as a mantra to remind students that yes, drugs can help, but not in all cases, and never on their own.

**4.2.5  Academic Support Program: Responsibility to Optimize Accommodations**

Following lunch at the ADHD conference, I headed to the next session, “How to Succeed 

in College with ADHD.” Unlike the other sessions, which took place in auditoriums and 

conference rooms, this session was held in a regular classroom where the audience sat at desks 

like real students. I took my seat between two middle-aged white women and introduced myself 

as a graduate student interested in learning about ADHD. The woman on my right told us that 

she was at the conference because she recently fostered two African American boys with ADHD who were about to enter high school and she wanted to learn more about the condition. The woman on my left told us that she also had a son in high school and was considering getting him tested for the condition because he was having a hard time in school. Out of the comer of my 

eye, I watched the room fill up to the point where one of the moderators had to bring in extra 

chairs. This would be a popular session, especially for parents. Sitting on the panel at the front of

the room were three graduating students from the community college: a while female name Emma, a Hispanic female named Gabby, and a white male named Zach. Joining them were the mothers of all three students, as well as the of the director for Project BRAVE, a program at the 

community college which provided academic and technological support for students with ADHD. The program was funded by a grant from Shire Pharmaceuticals and is only eligible to 

students who have a verified diagnosis and make it through a rigorous selection process, much like the Michael Gold’s ADHD College Scholarship Program.

The Project BRAVE director, Elsa Adams, began by introducing the students and the wide range of accomplishments they achieved while being a part of Project BRAVE. These included improvements in their GPA, running for student government, and acceptance into four year institutions. Ms. Adams then asked a prepared set of questions about their experience in Project BRAVE and how they were able to become successful ADHD college students. The first 

question asked, “What is the biggest difference between high school and college?” Zach immediately responded, “You need to actually take responsibility for yourself.” He went on to describe how unstructured college is because you cannot just hop on the school bus and have your teacher remind you what is due all the time. Emma and Gabby nodded in agreement and Emma said “if you don’t show up or do the work, you are basically wasting your parent’s money.” Zach also explained that in college you also have a lot of freedom, you can smoke on 

campus or drink so it is the student's’ responsibility to make sure they do not “go crazy with the 

freedom.” Ms. Adams jumped in and explained that this conflict between responsibility and 

freedom is especially difficult for students with ADHD because they do not have the skills to organize their life.

“What helped you to finally be successful?” was the second question Ms. Adams asked.

Zach chimed in again and said “learning how to get organized, manage time, basically learn how to be a student.” He went on to describe how before Project BRAVE he did not have the motivation to do well in school because it felt too hard. Ms. Adams interrupted his story and 

asked “Zach, can tell the audience about the other big change you made that really helped you?” Zach paused for a moment and racked his mind. “Do you mean the smart pen?” he said holding up the pen in this hand which allowed him to digitize his class notes. Ms. Adams replied, “No, the other thing that you started taking that really helped you get your school work in line.” Zach 

looked confused but then it hit him. “Oh yeah! I started taking medication again!” Ms. Adams 

looked pleased and asked Zach to tell the audience about his experience. Zach explained that when he was first diagnosed with ADHD in middle school, his doctors had put him on Ritalin 

and it made him “feel like a zombie.” He lost his appetite and as soon as he was eighteen, he 

stopped taking the medication, even though his parents wanted him to continue. It was not until 

last year, after his classmates told him about their positive experiences with a new medication, that he considered taking it again. He turned to the audience and explained, “even though medication didn’t work for me before, that doesn’t mean that it can’t work for me now that I am 

an adult. Now I actually want to do well in school. I actually love learning.” The woman sitting next to me with the son in high school raised her hand and asked Zach “What’s the name of the medication you are using?” Another parent said out loud “yeah, is it Adderall?” Zach replied 

“no, it's called Vyvanse.” Another parent asked “How do you spell it?” I looked around the roomalmost every person was writing down the letters as Ms. Adams spelled it out. “V-Y-V-AN-S-E.”

**4.2.6  Disabilities Services Provider: Responsibility to Personalize Accommodations**

It was a late afternoon in the spring of 2014 when I sat down meet with Francesca Riley, one of the staff at the Disabilities Services Center (DSC) at American State University. We were introduced via email by Dr. Nicholson after I had attended the Disabilities Services Conference the preceding fall where they had jointly presented the “ADHD Crises” talk. When we sat down, 

she told me that the best way to really know how services work are to walk me through the entire process from start to finish. Over the next hour, we pretended that I was a student who had come in for ADHD accommodations and it was Ms. Riley’s job to determine whether or not I would be 

eligible for the services. Throughout the mock intake, Ms. Riley shared with with me a number of anecdotes that began to reveal the underlying complexity of what at first seemed to be a relatively transparent process.

Ms. Riley began by pulling up the DSC homepage on her computer and told me that the 

first step to receiving accommodations is to make a formal request to meet with a services officer. To do this, a student must login to the website with their university ID and create a profile that included detailed contact information and some general notes about their disability. We logged in and were prompted with a checklist of options, one of which was “Learning Disability (includes ADHD)”. Once I submitted the electronic form, it automatically generated a request for a “confidential needs assessment” with a disabilities services officer. Ms. Riley 

explained that before they created the online profile system, they spent the majority of their time dealing with students who would call in or stop by the office to request accommodations because they believed they had a disability. In many cases, these students did not have documentation of a diagnosis, or would fail to follow up, making it difficult to keep track of their information. She told me “students come in and they think that is all they need to do. But no. I don’t even know 

120


---

###### Page 132

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_132_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_132_7.png)

you. I need documentation. They need an assessment.” Ms. Riley told me that now that they have the electronic system, they take every opportunity to advertise the website during workshops for students so that they take the responsibility to initiate the process.

She then told me that once the student registers with the website, the DSC then starts a file on the student and sets up the needs assessment meeting. Students are asked to provide formal evidence of their condition during the meeting, but she told me that many students fail to comply because they either do not understand what that means or simply do not have any documentation. Ms. Riley told me that this is one thing she wishes she could change about the system - to require students to submit evidence before the meeting. That way, she could “weed out” those students who do not have a documented disability before spending an entire meeting deciding on potential accommodations that they do not even qualify for. She told me this was especially true for ADHD because students would often come to DSC to receive accommodations for the condition before they were even officially diagnosed because they were sure they had the condition. When this would happen, she often told them “we are all a little ADHD sometimes. ADHD is a spectrum and you need an assessment to know if it’s bad enough that you need accommodations.”

I asked Ms. Riley to describe the kind of evidence she expected from a student and she told me that at minimum, she wanted to see a clear diagnosis written on official letterhead from a licensed medical professional. However, this was rarely what students would provide. In fact, Ms. Riley told me that one of the hardest parts of her job was deciphering the range of evidence that students brought in. She complained that a lot of doctors were vague in their diagnoses and “don’t want to put their jobs on the line” so she ends up having to sort through “twenty pages of gibberish” and only to find out they didn’t give a diagnosis. She recounted one story in particular 

121


---

###### Page 133

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_133_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_133_7.png)

that highlighted his frustration.

“One time I called a secretary [at a doctor’s office] because there was no diagnosis. It 

was vague language all the way through. And I called her and said ‘You know I need a 

diagnosis.’ And she laughed and said ‘Yeah, we call that fluff.’ And I said ‘What?’ And 

she said “We call that fluff. I mean, they pay over a thousand dollars to get this so we 

want to give them something that makes them feel like they’re getting something for their 

money.’ Can you believe that?”

Other forms of ADHD evidence that students have brought into DSC include empty prescription bottles for various stimulants and non-stimulant medications; packets of full page brain scans 

(without any clear diagnosis); self-assessments from the internet; and even notes from their parents. To deal with these discrepancies, students were now required to have a licensed medical professional fill out a standardized form provided by DSC in order to qualify for

accommodations. Even then, she would have to look through the paperwork with a critical eye to 

determine the qualifications of the doctor and whether or not they did a thorough job with their 

diagnosis. She explained that a psychiatrist or a neurologist was more convincing to her than a regular M.D. because they knew how to do a proper assessment.

If Ms. Riley was still unsure about a student’s ADHD status she almost always suggests that they go, see Dr. Nicholson to receive a formal assessment. That way she could feel good 

about providing an accommodation because she knew the student was thoroughly evaluated.

This was especially true for students who were diagnosed as children and have been on stimulant medication for a long time because their testing was outdated and “they aren’t the same people they were ten years ago.” At the same time, Ms. Riley also referred to several doctors who work within the student health care system and the surrounding area who were notoriously bad at 

conducting assessments and filling out documentation. When she would see these names on 

student’s records, she would take extra care to make sure everything checked out before providing accommodations paperwork.

122

###### Page 134

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_134_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_134_7.png)

I asked Ms. Riley if the DSC kept track of medication or whether or not they used that as 

evidence that a student qualified for accommodations. She explained that they do make a notation if a student volunteered the information or if they are having problems with the medication. She told me that she has had a number of students who do not respond well to Adderall and that she told them that everyone responds differently so they should not feel pressured to take what others are taking. I asked her if their decision to use or not use medications in anyway affected their ability to receive accommodations. She told me, “if they 

decide to stop taking it, I’m not going to change their accommodations. If anything, it might mean that they need more accommodations.”

Lastly, I asked Ms. Riley how she though professors felt about having to provide 

accommodations to ADHD students and she told me that every once in awhile she would have to 

deal with a professor who did not understand the rules. She recounted one incident with a professor who was fed up with the number of students who were asking for special test venues because of their ADHD. She told me “the guy was just a total obnoxious jerk, and you know, and he would yell and scream and carry on, and she just wanted to say, ‘Look buddy. Put a lid on it. 

Bring it down a little.’” Although these professors are the outliers, Ms. Riley’s told me that this 

is why they try to make sure the accommodations are supported by DSC, as well as a medical professional. This is one of the reasons she becomes frustrated when students fail to follow up with proper documentation. She told me, “I would hope that they follow through. Because then 

I’m putting in a lot of time. So, if they don’t follow through at that point, it’s kind of a waste of my time.”

**4.3  DISCUSSION**

Conrad and Potter (2005) describe the influence of medicalization processes and ideologies 

in the early 2000s has reshaped the dynamics of the doctor-patient relationship. Although doctors remained gatekeepers for medical treatment, their roles had become more subordinate as 

diagnoses were driven by pharmaceutical industry interests and demands from the expert patient 

(Fox et al. 2006). The internet, advocacy outreach and other forms of communication-diffused knowledge about adult ADHD and the potential benefits of Adderall in improving performance 

in adults. As a lifestyle drug, Adderall catered to consumers who wanted to quickly, safely, and 

effectively fulfill their biomedical and social potentials. In this framework, ADHD diagnoses presented an opportunity to access these drugs and the transformations they promised.

My research suggests that, in the last decade, the ADHD treatment landscape has evolved 

significantly in response to pharmaceuticalization, triggering social and personal moments of moral breakdown for health service providers at American State University. DSM definitions for Adult ADHD continued to evolve throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s, which both 

expanded and obscured criteria for diagnosis. Moreover, it morphed ADHD into a

simultaneously psychiatric, neurobiological, and behavioral problem, creating opportunities for new forms of expertise to become engaged with and emerge from these newly expanded/refined 

diagnostic categories. Increases in ADHD students requiring accommodations, along with media 

coverage of dangers of stimulants, lead the public to question the intentions of the medical professionals who facilitate or deny treatment. Together, these factors contributed to an ongoing 

struggle between medical professionals and their patients to properly define ADHD and regulate the responsible use of prescription stimulants. In the following sections, I discuss how health 

service providers and ADHD experts in my study morally positioned themselves, their products, 

124


---

###### Page 136

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_136_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_136_7.png)

and their consumers in relation to these moments of moral breakdown.

**4.3.1. Practices: Generalized Treatment to Optimized/Personalized Management**

The ADHD treatment landscape has become increasingly complex and experts are now 

engaging with patients in multiple settings and through a number of interactions, including various forms of diagnosis, treatment, and accommodations. This complexity is due to the multiple and highly compartmentalized ADHD treatment modalities that are currently 

operational across the modem American university. These interactions were heavily influenced by the paradoxical concerns that ADHD experts face when treating clients in a university setting. 

On one hand, they were danger of making it too difficult for students who need ADHD treatment 

and accommodations to receive it - (e.g. failing to facilitate responsible stimulant use). On the 

other, they were in danger of making it too easy for students to receive treatment and 

accommodations for ADHD when they do not really need it (e.g. failing to prevent irresponsible 

stimulant use). This resulted in a number of personal moments of moral breakdown in which they had to decide which students truly required and deserved treatment.

One way ADHD experts in my study recovered from these moments of moral breakdown was by establishing and re-asserting their authority over the treatment process. However, the 

forms of evidence they use to support this authority varied greatly within and across treatment modalities. For some, authority was established through earning professional credentials, such as 

a formal coaching certification, an Ivy League medical degree or holding a high ranking title within a professional organization, like CHADD. For others, authority was established through professional experience, such as published books or videos, original research articles, and the number of assessments you have completed in the last fifteen years. For others, it was more 

125


---

###### Page 137

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_137_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_137_7.png)

about personal experience, such as Ms. Evan’s positionality as the mother of three children with ADHD or experiencing the condition yourself, as was the case with many of my coaches in training.

Authority could also come from the ability to disperse financial and academic resources, 

such as ADHD-based scholarships, technology, academic tutoring and other forms of 

accommodations, as illustrated by Project BRAVE. It was further established by using scientific jargon and referring to recent research in the field that shows you thoroughly understand the 

condition, but can translate it to your patients, as was the case with each expert to various 

degrees. Finally, authority can be established by how hard you work to responsibly treat your patients, either by giving them access to as many pharmaceutical, medical, and academic ADHD resources as possible - or taking the time to find out if they even qualify for these resources in the first place.

Another strategy that experts in my study used to deal with moral breakdowns was to 

critique the practice of other ADHD service providers within and across various treatment modalities. We saw this in the way both university psychologist Dr. Nicholson and DSC officer 

Ms. Riley critique the poor diagnostic practices of private doctors. For them, proper assessment was the first and most crucial step to ensuring that only those students who truly have the 

condition are receiving the treatment and accommodations they need. This was most evident in 

Ms. Riley’s critique of the “fluff’ she receives from doctors who fail to properly debrief patients 

after assessments and allow them to leave the office without clarifying if they have a diagnosis or not. In contrast, Dr. Phillips critiqued those doctors who did not do everything in their power to 

ensure diagnosis and maximize treatment. For him, ADHD was a major debilitating condition that can significantly ruin a person’s life if not treated properly. Dr. Marin also took a critical 

126

###### Page 138

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_138_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_138_7.png)

view of doctors when he described the responsibility of coaches to teach their clients how to talk to their prescribers about their experience with stimulants. This is because he was skeptical that 

doctors would have the time, interest or knowledge about their ADHD patients to properly monitor their treatment.

In order to publicly assert their authority, these experts engaged in public forums in an 

attempt to shape the discourse about ADHD and present themselves as responsible treatment providers. The public interactions these experts had with potential clients was in many ways 

filtered through messages already established in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) prescription 

stimulant marketing landscape. All the participants in my study agreed with the pharmaceutical 

industry in that it was ultimately their responsibility to properly diagnose, treat and accommodate their clients. However, their standards of evaluation varied greatly and the more formalized they 

attempted to make these criteria, the more convoluted the process became - especially when they tried to communicate this with patients. We saw this in how Dr. Phillips presents over 75 slides with charts and graphs to indicate the legitimacy of his methods - especially when it seems like he is putting his patients at risk. Dr. Nicholson also relied on what he considers rigorous 

assessment methods, a combination of standardized psychological testing, patient history, self reporting and his own intuition as a veteran assessment expert. The fact that he spent between 1-

3 hours with a patient debriefing them on the whole process signals the complexity of his 

evaluation and his investment in making sure the right people get the right diagnosis.

At the same time, patients may be unwilling or unable to understand this language and 

are more drawn to explanations provided by cultural experts like Monica Evans or other expert patients, like the students from the Project BRAVE panel. These experts presented ADHD in tangible terms which clients would easily digest and relate to. Ms. Evans was especially effective 

127


---

###### Page 139

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_139_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_139_7.png)

in drawing connections with her audience through the use of multimedia mediums, like 

documentaries, books and posters that humanize the condition. Project BRAVE took it a step 

further and showed parents and other students what was possible to achieve through their treatment modality by providing living, breathing examples. Finally, instability caused by these multiple models came to full view when students who self-identified as ADHD came to DSC to meet with Ms. Riley for accommodations. Her struggle to make sense of all the conflicting forms 

of evidence they provide, and her attempts at standardization, highlight the growing instability of these issues. Although she was not a scientist or a medical professional, her assessment of ADHD was critical in shaping the treatment experience for many ADHD students at American 

State University. She only became an “expert” out of necessity due to the fact that ADHD was now qualified as a learning disorder. This put her in a powerful position to decide what counts as ADHD, and thus merits special accommodations, and what does not.

**4.3.2  Objects: From Enhancement or Lifestyle Drug to Cure or Foundation or Option**

During the treatment phase, prescription stimulants materialized and became tangible 

objects with real individual effects on patients. They were the reason why many people entered 

into exchanges with ADHD experts in the first place - to seek out or find out if they could benefit 

from these powerful medications. As a result, these ADHD experts must also present themselves 

as stimulant experts - even when they do not have the power to prescribe the drugs themselves. 

This also is why these experts face accusations under/over-facilitating stimulant use, because ADHD is so inherently tied to access to Adderall. Thus, the way they orient themselves and their practices around the drug is extremely important in establishing themselves as responsible treatment providers.

128

###### Page 140

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_140_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_140_7.png)

The ADHD experts in my study fell roughly into three camps regarding their thoughts on the functions of stimulant medication: stimulants as the cure, as the foundation, and as one of many options. Medical professionals largely regard drugs like Adderall as the primary treatment 

for ADHD because, in part, stimulants have been used to treat the condition for over forty years. As pharmaceutical science creates “new and improved” versions of these drugs, like Vyvanse, it 

is not surprising that experts like Dr. Phillips want to maximize the benefits of the drug. His 

studies that tested 2-3 times the FDA recommended dosage show how much value and trust he 

invested in stimulant medications. Dr. Phillips saw the function of medications not just to treat the symptoms of ADHD but to maximize the success of the patient. The only cap to this potential was any significant side effects that the patient was unwilling to deal with. Moreover, because it 

is seen as a lifelong, heritable, genetic condition, his job as a stimulant monitor never ends.

While all the doctors I spoke with recognized the potential benefits of stimulant medication, some started to reframe it as “the first line of treatment” for ADHD, rather than an 

overarching cure. This is due in part to the shift towards a neurobiological model of ADHD where stimulants are understood by their chemical effects and ability to regulate the dopamine uptake in the brain. At the same time, many experts, like Monica Evans and the directors of 

Project BRAVE, would argue that they are just a first, yet necessary step. During her presentation, Ms. Evans compared trying to deal with ADHD without medication to “trying to tie your shoes with one hand tied behind your back - you could do with, but why not just untie your hand?” In this metaphor, the user still needs to learn to tie their shoe, but medication makes it more possible. Similarly, Dr. Marin saw Adderall as one part of a more comprehensive treatment plan that included coaching and behavioral therapy. While he acknowledged the value of the 

drug, he also saw the potential issues that came from improper diagnosis and prescription. As a 

129

###### Page 141

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_141_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_141_7.png)

result, he encouraged his coaching students to become experts on the medication to help 

empower the clients to be responsible users. At the same time, his definition of expertise is 

questionable, as he spent only a few minutes providing an overview of the drugs to the class which begs the questions of how powerful he thought these drugs might be and whether or not it was a good idea to tell non-experts that it was their responsibility to help their clients manage their medication.

Finally, there were those experts who believe that stimulants can work, but not for 

everyone, and never on their own. This was certainly the case for Dr. Nicholson, who told me that Adderall was one of many options he presents to his clients. Although he himself cannot prescribe the drug, he had become an expert on its effects and the science around it because he was the last gatekeeper before the student took the referral to their prescribing doctor. Because he recognized the propensity for students to reach for the quick fix instead of working through the root cause of their problem and personalizing a treatment plan, he took it upon himself to thoroughly educate them. Ms. Riley also saw Adderall as one of many options, as well as the 

choice of the student. However, she clearly believed the substance has an effect because she 

explained that if a student decides to stop taking their medication, it is likely she would have to 

increase their accommodations.

**4.3.3  Subjects: From Expert Patient to Pharmaceutical Client**

Adderall emerged in the late 1990s in relation to the invention of the informed expert patient, a neoliberal subject who takes responsibility for their health care and empowers themselves by actively pursuing medical treatment (Henwood et al. 2003). However, changes in the last decade has reframed this pharmaceutical subject as a victim of irresponsible and unfair 

130


---

###### Page 142

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_142_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_142_7.png)

diagnoses, treatment, and accommodations, relying on drugs that ultimately marked them as 

cheaters or addicts. My research illustrates how ADHD experts in my study have responded to this social moment of moral breakdown to create what I term as the “pharmaceutical client,” a moralized subject who shares responsibility over responsible stimulant use with a variety of health care providers. This occurs by interacting with and informing patients through a number 

of public and private exchanges, including public presentations, professional training, and private treatments. While there are some key differences in these interactions, there are also some crucial 

qualities which they all expect from their clients. First and foremost, the pharmaceutical client is willing to take initiative to seek out treatment. This initiative can take many forms, such as 

attending an ADHD conference; completing a complimentary session with an ADHD coach; purchasing a book or DVD about the condition; or filling out a form that registers them with 

disabilities services. While clients are expected make the first contact, they must also be willing to listen to the expertise of the service provider.

For Dr. Phillips, the responsible client was someone who accepts their ADHD diagnosis as the barrier to success and happiness in their life. He was also someone who trusts in biomedicine 

and believes in the power of stimulants to remove these barriers. More importantly, they were willing to do whatever it takes to conquer their ADHD and maximize their potential until they 

cannot handle the side effects of the drugs. He also expected his clients to keep him in the loop 

so he can closely monitor the efficacy of the stimulants. Thus, although he was the drug expert, the responsible patient made sure to keep up their end of the deal by checking in regularly and being honest with him about whether or not they could handle more medication.

Monica Evans also expected her clients to accept ADHD as a real condition before she reached them. In fact, when I sat next to her during lunch at the conference and asked her if she 

131


---

###### Page 143

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_143_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_143_7.png)

had heard the argument that “ADHD is a socially constructed condition” she literally dropped her fork, looked at me and said “never! And anyone who says that is clearly an idiot!” Ms. Evans 

founded her career in CHADD around establishing the legitimacy of this disorder and as a result, 

interacts with a tight community of other experts and patients who share the same view. Her 

ideal client was someone who had the same convictions about the condition and would do whatever it took to fight for their rights as a person with a neurobiological disorder. At the same time, she also expected her clients to adopt her philosophy (or brand) of ADHD and support her 

cause by purchasing her merchandise and sharing it with others.

Dr. Nicholson also expected his clients to respect his years of experience and actively participate in the diagnosis process. However, he did not expect his clients to come in already knowing they have ADHD and ready to take medications. Instead, his ideal client was someone who was honest about their struggles and was willing to go down a guided journey to find the root cause and a personalized solution. He was particularly weary of students who tried to fake ADHD - although he did not blame them, he blamed the pro-stimulant environment they were 

embedded in. Instead he hoped to be the one to help this client realize the “real issue” and accept 

it, even if it was something they did not want to be labeled with, such as depression or PTSD. 

Because he dedicated so much time and effort into the assessment process, Dr. Nicholson hoped that his patients would appreciate his care and take his advice seriously as they moved on with or without a referral for ADHD.

Coaches in my study like Dr. Marin took a more co-active approach and focused on 

empowering their patients instead of applying their expertise to their condition. He also expected that his client would reach out to him if they needed help and were willing to go through the long 

and extensive process of ADHD coaching. At the same time, he did not see his clients as innately 

132

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_144_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_144_7.png)

understanding how to balance the coaching/behavioral therapy side of treatment with the 

sometimes necessary medication. Similarly, the directors of Project Brave also expected their potential clients - in this case, the audience members made up of parents and students - to recognize the importance of both medical and nonmedical interventions. While Dr. Marin did not want his clients to focus only on stimulants, Ms. Adams did not want parents to only rely on tutoring and other support services to be successful in school. Thus, for both of them, the responsible client someone who took the initiative to build their own personalized treatment program - but with the guidance of a knowledgeable ADHD expert.

### **4.4  CONCLUSION**

In this chapter, I provided evidence of an ongoing struggle between the ADHD experts 

and their clients in properly diagnosing the condition and regulating the responsible use of prescription stimulants at American State University. I argued that this represents a key moment 

of moral breakdown associated with the biomedicalization and pharmaceuticalization of performance in American college culture. I take this a departure from previous 

conceptualizations of the neoliberal expert patient who feels empowered by actively pursuing medical treatment (Fox et al. 2005). This perspective both appealed and contributed to 

concurrent patients’ rights movements and the establishment of advocacy groups like CHADD at the turn of the century by putting the control of health back into the hands of the consumer rather than the authority of medical professionals (Conrad and Potter 2005). My findings resonated with Oldani’s (2014) descriptions of high prescribers, such as Dr. Phillips, and pharmaceutically 

conscious doctors, like Dr. Nicholson, but also considers the influence of pharmaceuticalization 

on the emergence and practices of new forms of professional ADHD expertise.

###### Page 145

The case examples presented show how these health professionals are not only relying on neoliberal logics of consumerized healthcare but also creating new forms of moralized pharmaceutical subjectivity in response to this breakdown. Specifically, these experts relied on their positionality to stimulants as as un/safe, un/fair and in/effective treatments as a way to 

assert their authority over these exchanges and present themselves as responsible service providers. This included flexible criteria on how ADHD is defined, evaluated, treated, monitored 

and accommodated. Yet with each exchange, the symbolic meaning of stimulants as medication became unstable as both experts and clients unsuccessfully attempted to standardize fair 

qualifications for, and access to, ADHD services. As a result, ADHD clients must strategically 

assert their congruent identities as patient, consumer and/or student in order to navigate these multiple contexts and rationalize their desire for ADHD services. I argue that by doing so, both ADHD clients and experts are able to respond to these moments of moral breakdown, and maintain a perceived sense of responsibility to consume stimulants while also promoting the responsible stimulant use of others.

In the following chapter, I examine how these moral discourses are transmitted and transformed as prescription stimulants are dispersed to college students and circulated to their peers. I describe the experiences of college patients, turned Adderall dealers who are tasked with responsibly consuming prescription stimulants while maintaining responsibility over the responsible drug use of others. It also speaks to their positionality in regards to health services providers and how this influences dealer perceptions of prescription stimulants and their relationships with drug seekers. Moreover, it offers context for how illicit Adderall users 

interpret their experiences once they have gained access to these drugs.

**CHAPTER 5: CIRCULATION**

This  chapter  considers  how  moral  ideologies  are  filtered  from  the  ADHD  treatment 

landscape  and  absorbed  in  to  college  environment  to  inform  definitions  of  responsible  stimulant use  among  Adderall  Dealers.  It  builds  on  anthropological  literature  that  describes  the  experiences 

of  the  drug  seeker,  a  subject  who  is  driven  by  the  desire  to  get  high  and  is  in danger of  becoming 

disempowered  by  a  dependency  on  drugs.  I  also  draw  on  studies  from  the  health  and  social 

sciences  that  look  specifically  at  the  illicit  Adderall  market  on  campuses,  most  of  which  focus  on the  exchange  from  the  perspective  of  the  drug  seeker.  While  this  research  underscores  the normalization  of  dealing/seeking  Adderall  on  college  campuses,  little  is  known  about  the 

intentions  and  experiences  of  those  who  supply  these  valued  commodities.  As  a  result,  it  is unclear  if  and  how  responsibility  over  the  responsible  use  of  prescription  stimulants  is  negotiated 

and asserted between these actors.

Building  on  this  literature,  I  consider  how  the  circulation  of  prescription  stimulants  has 

evolved  in  respect  to  trends  in  pharmaceuticalization  in  the  last  decade.  Increases  in  the prevalence  of  illicit  Adderall  use  among  college  students  has  raised  public  concerns  over  the 

intentions  and  actions  of  drug  dealers  who  irresponsibly  distribute  stimulants  to  their  peers.  I  use media  reports  to  provide  key  insights  into  public  discourse  surrounding  this  social  moment  of moral  breakdown  and  highlight  the  ethical  dilemmas  faced  by  students  who  are  legally medicated  for  ADHD.  I  situate  these  dilemmas  within  the  evolving  Adderall  trade  on  campus 

described  in  Chapter  2  and  illustrate  how  certain  factors  such  as  the  perceived  impunity  of 

dealing,  the  demand  for  stimulants,  and  the  controversial  nature  of  the  drugs  they  deal  have 

shaped the prescription stimulant dealer-seeker relationship.

My  goal  in  this  chapter  is  to  explore  how  Adderall  dealers  at  American  State  have positioned  themselves,  their  medications,  and  drug  seekers  in  relation  to  both  social  and  personal moments  of  moral  breakdown  within  campus  stimulant  landscape.  To  accomplish  this,  I 

conducted  interviews  and  observations  with  eleven  students  who  are  legally  medicated  for ADHD  and  documented  their  experiences  within  the  stimulant  economy  on  campus.  I  present three  in-depth  case  examples  that  highlight  moments  in  which  ADHD  students  strategically resisted  from/participated  in  the  Adderall  market  on  campus  and  framed  their  decisions  as  acts  of 

social  responsibility.  These  case  examples  are  based  on  three  key  informants  who  illustrate  the broad  spectrum  of  moral  logics  Adderall  dealers  draw  upon  when  rationalizing  their  decisions.  I present  my  analyses  of  these  case  examples  around  relations-objects-subjects  to  systematically map  the  moral  discourses  that  surround,  and  are  produced  through,  the  circulation  of  prescription 

stimulants.  I  conclude  the  chapter  with  a  discussion  of  how  this  analysis  informs  conceptions  and 

expectations of pharmaceutical morality and subjectivity in the U.S.

### **5.1  MORAL BREAKDOWN: FAILING FRIENDS OR DEALING DRUGS**

Studies of illicit stimulant use on college campuses indicate a prevalence rate of up to 

43% within some college populations (Advokat et al. 2008). Many attribute this to the growing 

availability of these drugs from fellow students who have legal prescriptions (DeSantis 2005). According to research from McCabe et. al (2006), nearly 54% of ADHD students have been 

approached for their medication by fellow peers. Gamier et al. (2010) reports that nearly 62% of 

students admit to willfully distributing their prescription ADHD medication. The growing prevalence in the circulation of prescription stimulants has raised serious concerns around the 

safety, legality and ethics of this drug behavior. These commentaries typically focus on the 

136

###### Page 148

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_148_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_148_7.png)

experiences of the Adderall user, who actively seeks out medications from their peers in order to 

increase academic performance. As a result, little is known about the students who are legally medicated for ADHD and supply these drugs in the first place.

However, there are a few key instances in the last decade in which Adderall dealers have become the center of discussion. This was the case on December 10, 2010, when five students at 

Colombia University were arrested for selling $11,000 worth of drugs, including marijuana, 

cocaine, ecstasy, and Adderall. It was the result of a five-month undercover police investigation known as “Operation Ivy League.” One of these students was Stephen Perez, a Gates Millennium 

Scholar, who was the only student charged with selling his prescription ADHD medication to peers. After pleading guilty, Perez served 300 hours of community service and was subsequently 

expelled from the university. His story was one of the most publicized instances of a college 

student with ADHD who found themselves in the position of becoming a prescription drug 

dealer.

Media  reports  on  this  story  offer  insights  into  public  discourse  surrounding  this  moment 

of  moral  breakdown  and  the  highlight  the  ethical  dilemmas  faced  by  students  like  Perez,  who  are 

legally  medicated  for  ADHD.  For  example,  in  a  primetime  interview  with  reporter  Kate  Snow, 

Perez  shares  his  story:  a  young  boy  growing  up  in  a  poor  family,  dedicated  to  the  dream  of  one 

day  attending  prestigious  Colombia  University.  He  described  the  sacrifices  he  made  in  high 

school  and  continued  to  make  in  college  in  order  to  maintain  the  high  level  of  performance needed  to  be  successful  at  such  a  competitive  school.  One  of  his  strategies  was  to  use  Adderall, which  he  became  dependent  on.  In  the  interview,  he  recounts  how  easy  it  was  to  obtain  his  own prescription  from  the  student  health  center,  filling  out  a  few  forms,  and  even  admitting  to  doctors that  he  had  used  the  drug  illegally  with  positive  results.  Perez  blames  everyone  but  himself  for 

137

this  situation,  including  the  health  center,  administration  and  the  academic  culture  of  the university.  He  holds  on  to  the  belief  that  in  the  end,  he  was  only  trying  to  help  his  fellow students.

While  Snow’s  interview  paints  Perez  as  a  good  student  caught  in  a  bad  situation,  media accounts  of  this  event  have  varied.  Alternative  news  website  Gawker  ran  an  article  titled “Accused  Colombia  Frat  Boy  Drug  Dealer  Threw  ‘Da  Sickest  Party’”,  underscoring  a  different, less  responsible  side  to  Perez.  In  the  story  and  associated  images,  he  is  portrayed  as  someone more  interested  in  drinking  alcohol,  smoking  weed,  and  meeting  women  than  managing  his academic  responsibilities.  During  his  trial,  Perez’s  lawyer  wrote  a  letter  to  the  court  admitting that  although  he  had  joined  a  fraternity,  worked  a  campus  job,  and  was  involved  in  various student  groups,  he  also  began  smoking  marijuana  daily,  a  habit  he  financed  by  selling  the Adderall  he  had  been  prescribed.  Although  it  is  impossible  to  know  his  true  motives,  it  is  clear that,  for  Perez,  having  a  prescription  for  Adderall  served  a  number  of  academic  and  social functions beyond treating his diagnosed ADHD.

Perez  is  not  representative  of  all  ADHD  college  students  but  his  sentiments  highlight several  key  elements  of  being  in  college  with  a  legal  prescription  for  Adderall.  In  some  ways,  his narrative  mirrors  that  of  a  street  drug  dealer  in  that  access  to  prescription  stimulants  can  be  seen as  a  form  of  social  capital  and  an  avenue  for  financial  gain.  But  unlike  most  illicit  drug  use, consumption  of  prescription  stimulants  is  believed  to  have  a  productive  function  by  most  college students.  Thus,  the  distribution  of  one’s  medication  is  often  framed  by  both  drug  dealers  and seekers  as  an  act  of  generosity,  or  even  social  responsibility,  rather  than  a  straightforward financial  transaction.  Perez’s  story  also  calls  into  question  the  legitimacy  of  ADHD  diagnoses and  the  increasingly  complex  task  of  serving  ADHD  students  in  an  environment  where  their 

138

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_150_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_150_7.png)

medications  have  become  valued  commodities.  Finally,  the  fact  that  Perez  was  the  only  student arrested  for  selling  Adderall,  and  was  also  the  only  one  to  receive  this  level  of  media  attention  is telling  about  the  way  the  public  views  the  distribution  of  prescription  stimulant  versus  illicit street  drugs.  Perez  suggests  that  illicit  circulation  of  stimulants  has  become  so  normalized  on college  campuses,  that  fearing  legal  implications  was  laughable.  Moreover,  if  anyone  was  to blame,  he  claims  it  was  the  professors  who  assigned  unreasonable  workloads,  the  doctors  who prescribed  him  the  medications,  and  the  police  who  were  ignorant  to  the  culture  of  normalized stimulant use in the university.

The  concerns  raised  by  Operation  Ivy  League  are  part  of  a  growing  public  debate  over the  intentions  and  actions  of  drug  dealers  who  irresponsibly  distribute  stimulants  to  their  peers.  It has  emerged  as  the  result  of  a  number  of  factors  that  shape  this  evolving  Adderall  market  on campus,  such  as  the  perceived  impunity  of  dealing,  the  demand  for  stimulants,  and  the controversial  nature  of  the  drugs.  In  this  chapter,  I  examine  how  Adderall  dealers  have positioned  themselves  in  order  to  navigate  this  morally  convoluted  environment.  Specifically,  I ask,  how  is  responsible  stimulant  use  defined  and  facilitated  by  the  Adderall  dealers  and  seekers at  American  State  University  through  the  willful  circulation  of  prescription  stimulants?  How  do these  interactions  influence  and  embody  shifting  expectations  around  the  responsibility  to facilitate  and  participate  in  responsible  stimulant  use  among  my  participants?  In  the  following sections,  I  address  these  questions  and  examine  how  Adderall  dealers  at  my  field  site  frame  the drug  deal,  the  function  of  stimulants,  and  the  role  of  the  responsible  Adderall  seeker  in  relation  to these social and personal moments of moral breakdown.

**5.2  CASE EXAMPLES**

I  conducted  24  months  of  interviews  and  participant  observations  with  11  students  who were  legally  medicated  for  ADHD  and  documented  their  experiences  resisting  and  participating 

in  the  stimulant  economy  on  campus.  During  the  interview  phase,  students  were  asked  questions 

about  their  ideologies  and  experiences  as  they  related  to  medical  factors  (ADHD,  Adderall, pharmaceuticals,  doctors);  social  factors  (family,  peer  groups,  socialization,  drinking/drug  use); 

and  academic  factors  (transitions  into  college,  college  culture,  study  habits,  grades).  Each 

interview  lasted  between  2-4  hours  and  was  tape  recorded  and  transcribed.  Interviews  were 

coded  via  NVIVO  based  on  these  three  primary  contexts  and  then  with  sub-codes  related  to 

emergent themes from the data.

During  the  interview,  I  built  rapport  with  these  students  and  touched  base  with  each  of them  at  multiple  times  over  the  next  twelve  months.  Many  of  them  contacted  me  to  share  updates 

and  invited  me  to  social  events,  study  groups,  and  doctors’  appointments  where  prescription 

stimulants  were  openly  discussed  and  sometimes  distributed.  During  these  encounters,  I witnessed  moments  where  students  were  approached  by  their  peers  for  ADHD  medication,  both 

in  person  and  after  the  fact  via  social  media.  I  also  accompanied  several  informants  when  they were  actively  delivering  or  distributing  their  drugs  to  other  students.  It  became  clear  to  me  that no  two  drug  deals  were  the  same.  Some  were  pre-planned  drop-offs/pick-ups,  where  others happened  organically  during  study  groups  because  someone  had  an  extra  Adderall  they  were willing to share. It is impossible to tell how exactly my presence affected these encounters.

I  illustrate  how  the  circulation  of  Adderall  at  American  State  has  a  deeply  moralized negotiation  of  health,  empowerment,  and  responsibility  for  my  participants,  by  which  new biomedical  and  social  subjectivities  are  fashioned.  The  significance  of  these  transactions  is 

140

###### Page 152

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_152_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_152_7.png)

bolstered  by  the  fact  that  participation  in  this  drug  economy  is  not  only  normalized,  but  has become  an  expected  part  of  the  college  experience  for  many  of  these  students.  So  much  so  that simply  having  a  prescription  for  ADHD  medications  means  you  must  either  actively  resist  or ethically  rationalize  your  position  as  potential  drug  dealer,  sometimes  at  great  cost.  Of  the  eleven students  I  interviewed,  nine  admitted  to  having  distributed  their  medication  to  peers  and  family members  while  two  actively  resisted  such  requests.  Of  these  two,  one  had  their  medication  stolen multiple  times  by  friends  of  roommates  and  eventually  discontinued  filling  her  prescription.  The other  ended  up  in  rehab  several  months  later  because  of  a  subsequent  addiction  to  her  own medication,  which  was  the  primary  reason  she  was  unwilling  to  share  her  supply  in  the  first place.

The  prospect  of  being  a  drug  dealer  in  college  was  understood  and  acknowledged  in various  degrees  by  my  informants.  Some  find  it  so  detestable  that  they  cut  ties  with  friends  who approach  them  for  the  drug,  or  hide  their  ADHD  diagnosis  altogether  to  avoid  such  requests. Others  saw  the  identity  as  an  opportunity  for  both  economic  and  social  gain,  as  well  as  a  means to  help  fellow  students  manage  their  medical  and/or  academic  struggles.  Most  students  fell somewhere  in  between,  struggling  to  maintain  agency  over  each  potential  drug  exchange,  while convincing themselves that their actions are noble, or at the very least, socially acceptable.

The  dealers  I  interviewed  drew  on  a  combination  economic,  social,  and  medical  logics  to ultimately  make  their  decisions  on  whether  or  not  to  sell  their  drug.  Alex,  an  undeclared sophomore,  was  the  only  informant  I  interviewed  who  seemed  to  fit  the  traditional  drug  dealer stereotype.  He  had  a  legal  prescription  for  Adderall,  which  he  sold  along  with  a  number  of  street drugs,  such  as  marijuana  and  molly.  For  him,  Adderall  was  no  different  than  the  other commodities  he  peddled,  and  he  mostly  sold  to  students  (many  he  did  not  know)  who  would  use 

141

###### Page 153

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_153_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_153_7.png)

the  drug  for  recreational  purposes.  His  perception  of  impunity  seemed  the  highest,  as  I  remember him  pulling  out  a  Spiderman  lunchbox  from  his  backpack  during  our  interview,  to  reveal  a collection  of  small  baggies  filled  with  pills,  weed  and  other  drug-related  items.  Despite  his confidence  (or  maybe  because  of  it),  Alex  was  eventually  arrested  for  dealing  Molly  and  ended up  dropping  out  of  American  State  within  few  months  of  the  initial  interview.  In  contrast,  the  rest of  the  informants  in  my  study  only  ever  distributed  their  prescription  Adderall,  sometimes  for free  and  only  to  known  peers  who  "needed  it".  It  is  these  distinctions  that  would  both  socially and psychologically set them apart from “irresponsible” drug dealers like Alex.

In  the  following  sections,  I  present  three  case  studies  from  drug  dealers  whom  I  spent  a considerable  amount  of  time  with  for  this  study.  While  each  expressed  the  desire  to  both  serve and  protect  the  Adderall  seeker,  the  way  they  strategically  position  themselves  in  the  stimulant market  varies  greatly.  These  positions  served  to  ethically  rationalize  their  participation  in  this controversial  practice  and  illustrated  the  complex  value  systems  they  created  out  of  necessity.  By coupling  interviews  and  participant  observations,  the  following  cases  show  students’  moralized self-constructions  compared  to  their  lived  experiences  as  students,  friends,  patients,  and  drug dealers.

**5.2.1  Becca: Responsibility as Reliability**

It  was  a  month  before  final  exams  week  and  I  was  sitting  in  the  campus  food  court  with Becca,  a  sophomore  in  sociology.  I  had  texted  her  that  morning  to  meet  for  lunch  so  I  could  talk with  her  about  the  Adderall  shortage  that  was  supposedly  panicking  the  nation  that  spring.  As  we sat  down  with  our  trays,  Becca  began  to  describe  her  two-week  quest  to  track  down  a  pharmacy that  could  fill  her  prescription.  After  six  failed  attempts,  she  finally  found  one  an  hour  away  that 

142

###### Page 154

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_154_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_154_7.png)

could  accommodate  her.  She  recounted  her  frustrating  experience  waiting  in  line  behind  a  dozen people,  worrying  that  they  would  run  out  of  Adderall  before  it  was  her  turn.  Needless  to  say  she was  relieved  when  she  finally  came  back  to  campus,  stimulants  in  hand.  We  spent  the  rest  of lunch  talking  about  the  various  people  Becca  needed  to  contact  now  that  she  had  her  prescription refilled.  First  on  her  list  was  Jeremy,  a  student  whom  she  met  at  Battle  of  the  Bands  the  year before. He  was a  bassist in  a featured  band and  had caught  Becca’s attention  because of  his good looks  and  musical  ability.  She  told  me  that  she  “hooked  up”  with  Jeremy  that  night  only  to  find out  he  had  a  girlfriend  a  few  weeks  later.  She  laughs  and  told  me  that  now  the  three  of  them  are friends  and  that  she  sells  them  both  Adderall  on  a  regular  basis.  Another  customer  was  Rita,  a student  in  her  history  class  who,  according  to  Becca,  knows  every  DJ  and  break  dancer  at American  State.  Becca  heard  Rita  telling  another  student  before  class  how  her  “addy  hookup” fell  through.  Becca  offered  to  “hook  her  up”  and  explained  to  me  that  Rita  was  so  grateful  -  “she acted like I saved her life!”

As  we  were  finishing  up  our  lunch,  Becca  spotted  her  friend  Jack  standing  with  a  group  of athletes  across  the  cafeteria  and  waved  him  over.  1  had  met  Jack  before  at  a  soccer  party  that  I attended  earlier  that  semester  with  Becca.  Back  then,  she  did  not  really  know  him  that  well. 

Since  that  party,  she  had  been  flirting  with  Jack  via  text  but  the  extent  of  their  relationship  was unclear  to  me  at  that  point.  Jack  slowly  made  his  way  through  the  crowd  and  over  to  our  table. 

She  smiled,  playfully  tugged  on  his  shirt  and  announced:  “Guess  what?  I  just  got  my  script.  90 days.  So  tell  your  boys.”  Immediately,  a  smile  spread  across  Jack’s  face  as  he  sat  down  and  put his  arm  around  her  and  exclaimed:  “Are  you  serious?  This  is  why  I  love  you.”  Becca  giggled  and replied, “I’ll remember you said that”.

During our initial interview several months earlier, Becca had little experience selling

Adderall  but  openly  embraced  the  idea  of  being  a  “drug  dealer”  because  it  made  her  feel  like  a 

“badass”.  She  contrasts  this  glorified  persona  to  her  pre-college  identity  which  was  an 

inexperienced “prude” who did not have any friends - or fun. She told me,

“Throughout  my  life  I’ve  always  struggled  with  acceptance.  And  I’ve  been  grappling 

with  that  my  entire  life  and  especially  through  middle  and  high  school  because  I  was  like 

an  outcast  and  I  wasn’t  cool  and  all  that  stuff  and  I  didn’t  have  a  lot  of  friends.  And  so 

I’ve  always  struggled  with  that  especially  like  with  physical  image  and  just  being 

accepted.  I  have  a  need  to  be  liked  and  I’ve  been  working  on  that...  The  weird  thing  is 

that  I  resented  my  parents  for  putting  me  on  meds  so  young.  That’s  probably  a  big  part  of 

why I felt like an outcast, like a delinquent or something.”

Becca’s  claimed  that  her  insecurities  growing  up  were  rooted  in  her  initial  ADHD  diagnosis which  occurred  when  she  was  just  six-year-old.  Although  she  does  not  remember  exactly  how 

she  was  tested,  she  recalls  being  in  a  room  filled  with  toys  while  her  parents  and  doctors  talked 

about  how  they  thought  that  something  must  be  wrong  with  her.  She  was  eventually  prescribed 

Ritalin  and  remained  on  the  drug  for  only  six  months  before  she  was  switched  to  Wellbutrin,  an 

anti-depressant.  In  many  ways,  Becca  blames  her  lack  of  social  skills  on  being  medicated  from 

such  an  early  age.  She  told  me  about  her  difficulty  connecting  with  people,  especially  during high  school  when  popularity  started  to  become  more  important  to  her.  She  told  me  how  the  “cool kids”  in  school  were  known  for  their  promiscuity  and  recreational  drug  use,  something  that  she never  considered  taking  part  in  until  she  got  to  college.  When  I  asked  her  what  changed  between high school and college, she told me,

“I  guess  you  could  say  I  grew  up?  I  used  to  be  extremely  naive.  Well,  on  the  one  hand  I 

didn’t  know  things.  On  the  other  hand,  I  disagreed  with  a  lot  of  drug  use  and  stuff.  Like 

now  I  smoke  weed  and  sometimes  I  drink  alcohol  and  I  take  Adderall  and  I  sell  it  and  I’m 

not  a  virgin  anymore.  I  used  to  be  incredibly  naive  and  that  would  come  from  not  being 

in the popular crowd because it was socially acceptable for them to do everything.”

The  fact  that  Becca  seamlessly  weaves  her  Adderall  dealing  in  with  drinking  and  losing  her virginity  suggests  that  for  her,  it  is  part  of  a  larger  social  transformation  into  adulthood.  Taking

this  stance  helps  to  rationalize  her  decision  to  experiment  with  risky  behaviors  that  she  knows 

could  pose  serious  medical  and  legal  consequences.  Although  Becca  had  heard  about  students  in high  school  taking  Ritalin  recreationally,  it  was  not  until  she  was  at  American  State  that  she realized  how  valuable  of  a  commodity  prescription  stimulants  had  become.  She  had  tried Adderall  once  during  her  freshman  year  after  she  received  it  from  a  friend  with  a  prescription 

and thought  it  really he lped h er f ocus. S he  decided  that  she  wanted to  see  her psychiatrist  and try to  get  her  own  supply.  She  told  me  that  although  she  wanted  Adderall,  they  prescribed  her 

Strattera,  a  non-stimulant  ADHD  treatment.  According  to  Becca,  prescribing  Strattera  was  a 

strategy  to  prevent  students  from  gaining  access  to  Adderall  because  they  know  a  lot  of  people 

abuse it.

After  using  the  drug  for  a  few  weeks  to  mask  suspicion,  Becca  told  me  that  she  eventually 

convinced  her  psychiatrist  to  switch  her  to  Adderall  because  she  felt  it  would  work  better.  Her 

doctor  agreed,  and  for  the  first  time  Becca  found  herself  in  the  position  of  having  extra medication  laying  around.  It  was  at  that  point  that  she  first  considered  selling  her  medication  to make some  extra money.  Since Becca  knew little  about how  to sell  drugs, she  gave her  bottle to  a 

friend  who  sold  marijuana  and  claimed  he  would  be  able  to  find  buyers.  Becca  told  me  that  after 

almost  two  months  of  dodging  her  calls,  she  realized  that  he  had  ripped  her  off  and  either  could not  find  buyers  or  had  sold  the  medication  and  kept  the  profit  for  himself.  She  told  me  that  after that  incident,  she  knew  if  she  wanted  to  make  money  off  of  her  medication,  she  needed  to  handle 

it  herself.  She  had  witnessed  other  students  sell  Adderall  and  felt  like  she  now  had  a  better understanding of how the drug economy worked on campus.

After  a  few  weeks  on  Adderall,  Becca  realized  that  she  did  not  need  to  take  it  regularly  in 

order  to  complete  her  academic  work.  Once  again,  she  found  herself  with  a  surplus  of 

145

medication,  this  time  a  name  brand  pill  that  everyone  would  want.  Becca  told  me  she  really 

“owned”  the  drug  dealer  persona  and  pushed  hard  to  sell  her  medication  every  chance  she  got because she  had a  surplus of  over 100  pills that  had accumulated  over the  course of  one semester. 

I  asked  her  why  she  did  not  just  return  the  unused  drugs  to  her  psychiatrist  and/or  ask  for  a reduced  dosage  and  she  told  me  that  she  had  not  even  considered  that  before.  At  the  time,  she 

claims  that  her  decision  to  sell  them  was  strictly  pragmatic  and  that  she  would  only  sell  it  to people  she  knew.  When  I  asked  her  if  she  felt  like  she  would  be  pressured  to  sell  her  Adderall 

once  people  knew  about  her  prescription,  she  told  me,  “No.  It’s  usually  people  that  know  that  I take  it  or  that  I  have  a  prescription.  I  broadcast  it  pretty  widely  so  I’m  like  hey,  if  you  ever  need Adderall, I have some.”

Becca  seems  to  construct  herself  as  a  reliable  drug  dealer  who  is  there  to  provide  her 

friends  with  a  commodity  that  she  knew  was  in  high  demand.  Because  she  is  networked  with 

other  students  who  regularly  use  the  drug,  she  saw  her  surplus  medication  as  a  way  to  solidify those  friendships  and  build  new  ones.  When  she  talks  about  her  clients,  she  does  so  with  a positive  inflection  and  excitement  in  her  voice.  For  example,  she  told  me,  how  she  shares  her Adderall  with  her  roommate  who  does  not  have  a  prescription,  “My  roommate  takes  it  like  a  few times  and  I’m  like  totally  cool  with  giving  her  the  pills  because  she’s  my  roommate  and  I  love her  to  death.”  Later  during  my  participant  observations  with  Becca,  I  would  come  to  realize  how 

Becca  depended  on  the  affections  of  her  clients  just  as  much  as  they  depended  on  her  for  her medication.  This  fact  became  clear  when  Becca’s  surplus  eventually  ran  out  and  she  was  put  in  a position  where  all  of  her  handwork  networking  and  building  friendships  might  become 

compromised.

Although  Becca  sells  her  medication  regularly  to  people  who  do  not  have  ADHD,  she  does 

146

not  approve  of  students  who  fake  having  the  condition  in  order  to  obtain  and  sell  Adderall  to 

others,  especially  those  who  “brag  about  it”.  It  seems  that  for  Becca,  having  ADHD  meant  that her  access  to  Adderall  was  somehow  more  legitimate  than  for  others  who  only  got  a  prescription to  sell  it.  Because  it  was  rightfully  her  medication,  she  should  be  able  to  do  what  she  wants  with 

it,  and  that  includes  selling  it  to  other  students.  She  also  feels  like  students  have  the  right  to  buy Adderall  if  they  want  to  even  if  it  is  illegal  because  it  comes  with  the  territory  of  being  a  college 

student.  She  told  me  how  students,  including  herself,  brag  about  the  benefits  of  the  drug.  She  told me,

"Yeah...urn...I’ve  done  it  [bragged  about  it],  I  took  Adderall  yesterday  and  I  cleaned  my 

entire  room.  Like,  um,  a  victory..  .not  a  victory,  that’s  a  wrong  word.  Like  a  success  type 

thing.  Like,  I  cleaned  my  entire  room!  I’m  very  proud  of  myself  right  now.  Yeah  or  like  I 

finished a 30-page paper because I took Adderall.. .so yeah." Although  Becca  uses  Adderall  because  she  believes  she  has  ADHD,  she  also  acknowledges  that 

it  can  be  a  powerful  performance  enhancer  for  students  without  the  diagnosis  -  a  fact  that  does not  seem  to  bother  her.  If  anything,  it  helps  her  to  feel  connected  to  her  peers  because  they  are using  the  same  drugs  and  experiencing  the  same  sense  of  productivity  and  success.  Framing Adderall  as  a  productive  commodity  also  helps  to  rationalize  her  decision  to  continue  selling 

drugs  to  her  friends  in  the  first  place,  as  though  she  is  granting  them  access  to  its  powers.  This  is 

a  significant  departure  from  her  narrative  of  feeling  like  an  outcast  in  grade  school  because  of  her medication,  and  ultimately  illustrates  the  role  Adderall  plays  in  constructing  Becca’s  identity  as peer, patient and drug dealer.

It  seems  that  for  Becca,  the  demand  for  Adderall  in  college  is  a  large  factor  in  fashioning her  own  identity  as  a  student  with  ADHD.  It  has  transformed  the  way  she  views  her  diagnosis  as 

a  mark  of  delinquency,  to  an  opportunity  to  gain  the  social  status  she  so  desperately  wanted.  Like many  students  who  were  diagnosed  with  attention  disorders  as  a  child,  Becca  described  her

struggle  with  understanding  and  accepting  her  diagnosis,  as  well  as  her  need  for  the  medication. However,  as  she  entered  into  the  college  environment,  where  Adderall  use  was  not  only normalized,  but  glamorized,  she  acquired  a  new  lens  to  understand  her  relationship  to  her medication.  Becca  rationalizes  her  behavior  by  contextualizing  it  as  part  of  the  modem  college experience,  where  students  are  expected  to  mature  and  grow  up,  while  at  the  same  time, experiment  with  drugs  and  rebel  against  the  system.  In  other  words,  experimenting  is  in  fact  a part of Becca’s responsibility as an emergent adult in the college context.

Becca  seems  to  willingly  assume  the  drug  dealer  identity  and  constructs  her  moral  agency around  the  ability  to  reliably  provide  Adderall  to  her  friends.  The  more  time  I  spent  with  Becca, the  more  I  realized  that  the  majority  of  her  social  relationships  in  college  were  somehow connected  to  her  role  as  a  dependable  Adderall  provider.  In  this  way,  Adderall  tied  directly  to  her social value  as a  friend, roommate,  classmate, sexual  partner, and  a drug  dealer. The  strength and basis  of  these  ties  are  brought  to  light  when  Becca  is  faced  losing  the  trust  of  her  network  during the  Adderall  shortage.  It  is  only  when  she  is  able  to  finally  refill  her  prescription  that  Becca seems  to  be  able  to  uphold  her  responsibility  to  her  clients,  and  maintain  their  trust,  that  her agency is restored.

**5.2.2  Mark: Responsibility as Liability**

I  was  sitting  outside  on  the  steps  leading  up  to  the  campus  library  around  9pm  during  finals week  with  Mark,  a  junior  in  economics.  He  had  texted  me  earlier  that  night  to  meet  up  so  he could  show  me  all  of  the  messages  he  received  from  fellow  students  looking  for  Adderall  that week: “Hey  can  I  come  over  tonight?  ”,  “Can  I  get  some  Adderall?  ”,  ”  I  hate  to  ask  you  but  do you  have  any  Adderall  left?  ”,  “Did  you  get  your  script  this  month?  ”,  “Addy?  ”,  “You  studying

tonight?”  There  were  16  messages  in  total,  each  soliciting  Mark  for  Adderall  in  both  overt  and subtle  ways.  I  asked  Mark  how  he  felt  about  the  influx  of  attention  he  was  receiving  and  he rolled  his  eyes.  He  explained  that  he  thought  it  was  pathetic  how  desperate  students  were  and was  amused  that  they  thought  they  could  actually  get  him  to  just  sell  off  his  own  medication.  He also expressed  frustration because  many of  the people  who texted  him were  not even  supposed to know  that  he  had  a  prescription  for  ADHD  medications,  let  alone  assume  that  he  would  be willing to share.

A  few  minutes  into  our  conversation,  a  young  man  named  Stephen  emerged  from  the library  and  offered  us  a  cigarette.  He  sat  down  and  chatted  for  a  few  minutes,  asking  us  about exams  and  venting  about  his  own  unreasonable  finals  schedule:  two  papers,  an  oral  presentation, and  a  calculus  final.  After  about  ten  minutes  of  small  talk,  Stephen  leaned  in  toward  Mark  and asked  if  he  could  borrow  some  Adderall  to  finish  the  paper  he  was  struggling  with.  Mark  looked down  at  the  ground  and  told  him  that  he  was  sorry  but  he  did  not  have  any  on  him.  Stephen asked  if  he  could  stop  by  his  dorm  later  that  night  and  offered  to  pay  Mark  ten  dollars  for  a  lOmg tablet.  Mark  hesitated  for  a  moment  but  ultimately  gave  in.  He  told  Stephen  that  he  did  not  want his  money  as  long  promised  not  to  tell  anyone  where  he  had  got  the  Adderall  from.  Stephen enthusiastically  agreed  and  gave  Mark  and  I  a  hug  before  heading  back  into  the  library.  As 

Stephen  walked  away,  Mark  turned  towards  me  and  said,  “so  now  you  see  what  I  am  dealing with?”

During  our  initial  interview,  Mark  told  me  that  he  was  not  openly  interested  in  selling  his Adderall.  In  fact,  when  he  got  his  prescription  for  the  drug  his  freshman  year,  he  tried  his  best  to completely avoid the pressure of becoming a drug dealer by hiding his diagnosis. He explains,

"Nobody  knew  I  had  Adderall  except  my  roommate  for  as  long  as  I  could  possibly  keep  it 

that  way.  Because  when  I  first  got  it,  I  had  this  weird  moral  thing  about  giving  it  to  other

people  or  selling  it.  I  just  felt  weird  about  it,  like  ‘I  don’t  want  to  be  a  drug  dealer’  type  of 

attitude about it. Plus, I need them. I actually have ADHD." Mark  was  first  diagnosed  with  ADHD  in  the  8th  grade  when  he  learned  about  the  condition  in  a high  school  preparation  class  called  “Freshman  Focus”.  Prior  to  the  class,  he  had  a  particular image  of  students  who  were  on  ADHD  medications  in  middle  school.  He  described  them  as “truant”  and  having  an  “I  don’t  give  a  fuck”  attitude  about  their  grades  or  respecting  their  parents and  teachers.  According  to  Mark,  these  students  did  not  have  the  proper  intentions  with  the  drug for  it  to  work.  Alternatively,  his  initiative  to  seek  treatment  was  a  direct  reflection  of  his  desire  to become  a  responsible  student  and  do  well  in  school.  Mark’s  mother  took  him  to  his  pediatrician and  he  explained  the  issues  he  was  having  in  school.  After  asking  a  few  questions,  and  with  no formal  testing,  Mark  walked  out  the  door  with  a  prescription  for  Strattera,  which  he  had  not heard  of  before.  Although  he  was  hoping  for  Adderall  because  that  is  the  drug  he  was  familiar with, he decided to give this drug a try.

Over  the  next  three  months,  Mark  felt  as  though  his  academic  performance  improved significantly.  At  the  same  time,  he  also  experienced  severe  side  effects  from  the  medication,  such as  nausea  and  vomiting,  which  counteracted  any  positive  effects  of  the  drug.  Mark  decided  to stop  taking  Strattera  and  continued  through  high  school  without  any  further  use  of  prescription drugs.  As  he  reflects  on  that  time  in  his  life,  he  believes  his  improved  grades  were  a  result  of  the neurological  effects  the  drug  but  also  his  decision  to  finally  take  his  school  work  seriously. Although  he  felt  like  he  could  have  gone  back  to  his  doctor  and  asked  him  for  a  different medication,  he  decided  that  he  could  get  through  high  school  on  his  own  and  did  not  want  to  risk experiencing  any  more  side  effects.  It  was  not  until  his  freshman  year  at  American  State  that  he considered  taking  ADHD  medication  again  when  he  started  hearing  about  students  taking Adderall  illicitly  as  an  academic  performance  enhancer.  Mark  told  me  that  he  decided  to  go 

150

through  a  family  doctor  since  he  heard  it  was  easier  than  going  through  the  student  health  center. 

He  told  me  that  the  first  time  he  took  Adderall,  he  was  shocked  by  the  strength  of  the  medication 

and how “shaky” he felt when taking it.

As  Mark  embarked  on  this  new  journey  to  understand  how  to  handle  his  powerful  new medication,  he  was  also  faced  with  the  pressure  to  sell  his  medication,  especially  once  his roommate  found  out.  Once  it  became  public  knowledge,  he  started  being  approached  more  often 

for  the  drug,  which  began  to  make  him  question  the  basis  of  his  social  relationships.  He  told  me, 

“It’s  funny  because  there’s  two  approaches.  There’s  the  ‘I  want  Adderall  approach,’  and 

the  I’m  gonna  hang  out  awkwardly  and  not  say  anything  for  twenty  minutes  and  have  a 

weird  side  conversation,  while  the  whole  time  I’m  just  wondering  if  you  are  hanging 

around for Adderall... I had no problem telling these people to piss off.”

Mark  elaborated  on  his  frustration  with  drug  seekers  who  feel  entitled  to  ask  for  his medication.  On  the  one  hand,  he  is  turned  off  by  individuals  who  outright  ask  him  to  sell  his Adderall  because  it  makes  him  feel  like  he  is  being  treated  like  a  drug  dealer.  On  the  other  hand, he  feels  angry  when  certain  people  “waste  his  time”  pretending  to  be  his  friend  or  care  about  his 

life  when  ultimately  they  are  just  trying  to  get  his  medication.  As  a  result,  Mark  held  a particularly  negative  view  of  the  types  of  people  who  would  approach  him  for  Adderall, 

especially  the  ones  that  would  brag  about  snorting  Adderall  or  using  it  to  party.  For  Mark,  these boastful  narratives  of  irresponsible  Adderall  use,  likened  to  the  consumption  of  street  drugs  like methamphetamine  or  cocaine,  only  increased  his  weariness  of  sharing  his  medication.  While  it  is unlikely  that  this  description  fits  every  student  who  has  approached  him  for  Adderall, 

generalizing  this  group  of  people  as  irresponsible  drug  users  helps  Mark  solidify  his  own  moral higher ground.

While  he  shows  general  disdain  for  these  individuals,  his  sentiments  also  indicate  a  level 

of concern over the fact that these students were unaware of the potential dangers associated with

151

###### Page 163

Adderall  use.  Given  his  own  negative  experiences  with  the  drug,  even  under  the  supervision  of  a medical  professional,  he  was  concerned  how  this  might  affect  him  as  the  one  supplying  the 

drugs.  He  told  me  he  is  especially  concerned  when  people  ask  him  for  multiple  pills  at  a  time.  He told me,

"Am  I  gonna  get  in  trouble  if  this  kid  is  found  in  a  ditch  somewhere  after  he  took  4 

Adderall?”  People  don’t  realize  that  odd  things  go  into  prescription  pills.  Things  that  you 

may  or  may  not  be  allergic  to  that  you  have  no  idea  about!  Like  things  that  only  your 

doctor  knows.  Like  if  I  give  you  this  amphetamine  and  you’re  allergic  to  it  and  swallow  a 

whole bunch of them, I’m gonna be the one who’s held responsible."

Despite  Mark’s  confidence  in  his  ability  to  resist  selling  his  Adderall  to  these 

irresponsible,  uninformed  drug  seekers,  he  clearly  does  distribute  his  medication,  as  evidenced by  his  exchange  with  Stephen.  During  the  interview  I  asked  him  how  he  decides  when  it  is  okay to share his pills. He laughed and told me:

“[Mark’s]  Moral  Criteria,  that’s  what  you  have  to  meet.  I  dunno,  it’s  weird,  I  have  like  a 

moral  compass...What  if  you  use  it  to  party,  and  you  end  up  dead  in  a  ditch  or 

something?  You  know,  the  whole  responsibility  thing...People  don't  realize  the  power  of 

it.”

Mark  frames  his  hesitation  to  sell  his  medication  as  a  feeling  of  responsibility  over  the  health  of his  peers.  He  assumes  that  if  a  seeker  requests  what  he  considers  to  be  an  excessive  amount  of Adderall  from  someone  they  do  not  know  well,  they  must  be  inexperienced  or  simply 

irresponsible.  At  the  same  time,  Mark  is  also  concerned  with  maintaining  agency  over  the transaction  itself.  In  particular,  he  expresses  the  discomfort  that  comes  with  accepting  money 

from  peers  and  the  social  implications  it  brings.  He  told  me  that  one  of  the  main  reasons  he  gives the  pills  away  for  free  is  because  he  can  justify  only  giving  1-2,  versus  selling  more  pills  for  a reasonable  sum  of  money.  He  told  me  that  doing  so  “feels  like  a  transaction  or  drug  deal  or whatever... Like it would never get to that point, where like I am a legit drug dealer”.

At  the  same  time,  Mark  admitted  that  he  does  accept  money  from  people  when  it  makes

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_164_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_164_7.png)

him  feel  comfortable.  He  told  me  that  there  is  “no  rhyme  or  reason  to  it”  and  that  “Because  like 

if  I’m  giving  it  to  you,  I’m  gonna  make  the  transaction  comfortable  for  me  and  whether  that 

include  money  or  no  money,  that’s  my  decision.”  Mark’s  desire  to  maintain  agency  over  the  drug 

exchange  is  particularly  evident  when  he  described  being  approached  by  someone  who  he  feels pressured to sell to.

"They’ll  come  up  to  you  and  say  like  ‘can  I  get  two  pills,  I’ll  give  you  5  bucks  each’  -

okay,  whatever.  Or  they’ll  ask  me  rather,  so  if  I  actually  have  them  pay,  I’ll  say  like  3 

bucks  each,  so  they’ll  give  me  the  money.  And  then  he’ll  be  like,  ‘ah  man,  my  friend  has 

it  too,  I  should  have  gotten  it  from  him  because  he  has  30’s  and  you  only  have  10’s’  and 

I’m  just  like  [in  an  aggravated  voice]  ‘Then  don’t  come  to  me!’  Like  don’t  come  to  me 

and then complain about it. Like I don’t care about selling to you at all."

Mark’s  story  indicates  an  internal  struggle  over  how  to  rationalize  his  distribution  of  medication, 

especially  when  he  ultimately  does  not  want  to.  In  this  scenario,  he  gave  into  the  pressure  to  sell his  medication  and  rationalizes  it  by  not  charging  the  full  offered  amount  (e.g.  taking  $3  instead 

of  the  offered  $5  per  pill).  For  Mark,  this  proved  that  he  was  not  in  it  for  the  money,  rather,  he was  just  trying  to  be  a  nice  guy.  However,  when  the  drug  seeker  questions  the  value  of  his medication  and  argues  for  a  better  price  or  threatens  to  go  buy  Adderall  from  another  dealer, 

Mark  became  defensive.  For  him,  these  bargaining  techniques  implied  that  the  seeker  saw  him  as 

a  drug  dealer  trying  to  make  money,  rather  than  a  friend  looking  out  for  their  best  interest.  He reasserted  his  agency  by  reminding  himself  that  these  seekers  are  only  interested  getting  the  best 

deal  for  their  money,  rather  than  making  an  informed  decision  to  safely  increase  their  academic performance.

Like  many  prescription  holders,  Mark  found  himself  faced  with  the  moral  dilemma  of  how to  hold  onto  his  medication,  which  he  felt  he  needed,  without  alienating  his  peers  who  are 

experiencing  similar  academic  struggles.  To  cope  with  this,  he  constructed  a  narrative  of  a  moral 

self  who  can  resist  the  social  pressures  to  sell  to  irresponsible,  uninformed  drug  seekers.  Mark

believed  that  his  morality  precedes  his  use  and  distribution  of  Adderall  -  this  allowed  him  to justify his actions as ethical because otherwise he would not do it.

His  moral  compass  was  based  on  his  desires  to  be  a  responsible  student,  his  experience with  ADHD  medications  and  the  fact  that  he  recognizes  and  respects  the  power  of  these  drugs.  In 

contrast,  he  likened  the  typical  Adderall  seekers  to  a  recreational  drug  user  rather  than  someone who  would  use  the  drug  responsibly  and  for  noble  purposes.  At  the  same  time,  Mark  was  also 

struggling  to  understand  his  own  use  of  Adderall  as  he  described  the  simultaneously  enhancing 

and  detrimental  effects.  His  negative  experience  with  Strattera  and  the  fact  that  he  had  little 

control  over  the  powerful  effects  of  Adderall,  played  a  strong  role  in  the  way  he  understood  his hesitation  in  distributing  his  medications.  By  assuming  the  moral  authority  to  determine  who  is responsible  enough  to  access  his  medication,  he  also  asserted  his  own  morally  appropriate  use  of the drug.

Mark  was  not  an  experienced  drug  dealer,  nor  was  he  outwardly  interested  in  making money  off  his  prescription  medication.  While  he  held  on  to  the  image  of  the  upstanding  friend who  is  only  looking  out  for  his  peers,  he  also  felt  as  though  he  is  constantly  being  taken 

advantage  of  by  his  friends.  This  was  articulated  in  his  desires  to  feel  comfortable  during  the 

drug  exchange.  Once  again,  by  believing  that  his  morality  precedes  his  distribution  of  the  drug, he  relied  on  his  intuition  as  a  guide  as  to  who  to  sell  to  and  whether  or no t  to charge  them  for  the transaction.  For  him,  this  was  the  ultimate  distinction  between  his  practice  and  those  of  a traditional,  immoral  drug  dealer.  Yet  his  contradictory  actions  signaled  a  struggle  to  understand his own morality as he constantly re-evaluated these criteria with each situation.

**5.2.3  Abby: Responsibility as Authority**

It  was  6:15PM  on  a  mid-November  evening  and  I  was  driving  through  the  south  end  of campus  with  Abby,  a  senior  in  pre-medicine  at  American  State  University.  We  pulled  up  to  a duplex  in  a  student  neighborhood  and  walked  up  the  snowy  sidewalk  to  ring  the  doorbell.  We were greeted  by three  large but  friendly German Shepherds,  kept at  bay by  Jessica, a  freshman in Biology  whom  we  were  scheduled  to  meet  with.  We  took  off  our  shoes,  wet  from  the  snow outside,  and  made  our  way  to  the  living  room.  The  three  of  us  sat  on  a  large,  second  hand sectional  sofa  and  chatted  for  a  few  minutes  about  the  weather,  boyfriends  and  school  before  the conversation  turned  towards  Adderall.  The  “consultation,”  as  Abby  called  it,  was  about  to  start. 

She  began,  “So,  let’s  get  into  it.  I  know  that  you  have  never  tried  Adderall  before.  Can  you  tell me  what  you  know  about  it?”  Jessica  shifted  in  her  chair  and  replied  “Well,  I  know  it’s  supposed to help you like focus”.

Over  the  next  two  and  a  half  hours,  we  sipped  on  coffee  as  Abby  ran  through  her  complete consultation  agenda.  It  included  an  emotional  narrative  of  her  lifelong  struggles  with  ADHD,  an in-depth  medical  explanation  of  the  condition  and  the  effects  of  prescription  stimulants,  and  a full  battery  of  behavioral  questions  for  Jessica.  This  included  a  history  of  previous  prescription drug  use,  study  habits,  sleeping  patterns  and  a  number  of  other  factors  which  ultimately determined  whether  or  not  she  could  properly  benefit  from  Adderall.  Once  she  had  confirmed her  eligibility,  Abby  pulled  out  a  small  Ziploc  snack-size  bag  with  one  tiny  blue  lOmg  tablet  of Adderall  IR  and  told  Jessica,  “I  want  you  to  split  this  and  take  half  tomorrow  morning  and  half on  Friday.  Don’t  take  the  whole  thing.  Call  me  on  Saturday  and  we  can  figure  out  if  it  is  helping or  not”.  Jessica  agreed.  We  sat  for  a  few  more  minutes,  playing  with  the  dogs  and  laughing  at  the infomercial  on  TV  for  “pajama  jeans”  as  Jessica  fiddled  with  the  bag  in  her  hands.  We  followed

her to the kitchen to put our coffee mugs in the sink, hugged her goodbye and left.

When  I  first  interviewed  Abby  several  months  earlier,  she  had  clear  idea  of  who  the  typical Adderall  dealer  was  and  refused  to  put  herself  in  that  category.  She  described  them  as “ridiculous”,  “irresponsible”  and  “uneducated”  about  ADHD  the  drugs  that  they  were  selling. For  example,  she  told  me  how  some  students  would  openly  advertise  their  Adderall  as  a  “study aid”  on  “AllAmericanState.Com,”  an  online  classifieds  forum  for  students.  I  asked  her  to describe the advertisements and she told me,

“People  are  like  [sarcastically]  ‘oooh  do  you  want  study  pills?’...  These  kids  can’t  spell  it 

either!  It’s  ‘A-D-D-R-O-L’  and  I  know  what  you’re  trying  to  say  but  you  obviously  don’t 

know  what’s  going  on...  Why  the  hell  would  you  word  it  that  way?  I’m  like  ‘study  pills’, 

seriously?  And  I  almost  want  to  e-mail  them  and  be  like  who  the  hell  are  you?  First  of  all, 

if you’re going to sell it or buy it know what you’re talking about, spell it the right way.” Throughout  the  interview,  Abby  constructed  herself  as  someone  who  was  much  more  informed 

and  responsible  about  the  drug  than  these  other  dealers  she  references.  She  credits  this knowledge  to  her  therapist,  her  expertise  as  a  pre-med  student,  and  her  self-initiated  research  on the  topic.  Abby  told  me  that  most  students  who  end  up  selling  their  drugs  receive  them  from  a 

doctor  who  give  them  prescriptions  without  properly  diagnosing  them.  When  I  asked  her  why 

she  thought  that  happens,  she  told  me  that  she  believes  doctors  “just  want  to  give  you  the  meds” without  properly  testing  for  the  condition  -  which  is  why  the  condition  is  over  diagnosed.  Abby told  me  that  testing  can  be  expensive  but  it  is  worth  it  to  know  that  the  science  supported  her diagnosis,  and  as  a  result  she  had  “no  fear  that  the  drugs  [prescribed  to  her]  will  work  and  are 

safe.”

Abby  described  her  own  experience  getting  tested  for  ADHD  by  her  family  therapist  at  the 

age  of  19,  a  year  before  she  transferred  to  American  State  University  from  community  college. The  testing  was  her  therapist’s  idea  and  she  was  initially  skeptical  of  the  whole  thing  because  she

did  not  have  any  academic  performance  issues.  She  recounts  the  tedious  day-long  testing process,  much  of  which  she  saw  as  “random”  and  unnecessary  to  explaining  her  condition.  After three  months  of  waiting,  she  was  shocked  to  find  out  that  she  tested  positive  for  diagnosis,  but  as her  therapist  began  describing  the  symptoms,  and  eventually  revealed  her  own  struggles  with ADHD,  Abby  felt  like  it  finally  clicked  for  her.  Moreover,  her  therapist’s  willingness  to  divulge her  own  diagnosis  convinced  Abby  that  she  really  could  trust  her  to  know  what  was  best  in  the 

situation.  Abby  worked  with  her  therapist  to  determine  the  appropriate  dosage  of  medication  to manage  her  ADHD  symptoms.  Over  the  next  year,  she  was  prescribed  80mg  of  Vyvanse  and  two 

lOmg  Adderall  tablets  daily,  which  she  was  instructed  to  consume  in  the  evenings  to  extend  the 

effects.  However,  after  experimenting  with  her  medications,  she  determined  that  she  did  not  have to  take  Adderall  daily  -  only  on  days  she  forgot  to  take  her  Vyvanse  in  the  morning.  As  a  result, 

she  had  a  surplus  of  her  Adderall  at  the  end  of  each  month  and  the  possibility  of  sharing  her 

drugs was now on the table.

Although  Abby  did  not  sell  her  Vyvanse,  she  told  me  that  she  eventually  did  become 

comfortable  with  the  idea  of  selling  her  Adderall  under  certain  circumstances.  She  finally  sold  it 

for  the  first  time  to  a  longtime  friend  named  Jennifer  who  she  knew  had  used  ADHD medications  in  the  past.  One  day  while  studying,  Jennifer  and  Abby  had  a  long  conversation 

about  the  possibility  of  selling  her  Adderall.  She  ultimately  determined  it  was  the  ideal  scenario because  she  had  extra  medication  and  an  opportunity  to  make  a  few  extra  dollars  for  household 

expenses.  Moreover,  she  seemed  to  have  the  ideal  client  -  a  friend  who  probably  had  ADHD  and would  likely  take  the  drug  responsibly.  Although  Abby  sounded  confident  reflecting  on  her 

decision  to  sell  her  Adderall,  she  told  me  that  a  few  months  later,  she  felt  like  Jennifer  was  only 

coming  around  to  seek  the  drug  and  that  it  was  “getting  annoying.”  While  Abby  ultimately

decided  that  Jennifer  deserved  her  medication,  it  is  clear  that  the  way  her  clients  approach  her  is 

an  important  consideration  and  one  that  ultimately  shapes  her  self-understanding  as  a  responsible 

and  respectable  dealer.  Abby  mentioned  on  several  occasions  her  desire  to  maintain  agency  over not  only  who  would  receive  the  drugs,  but  when,  how  often  and  how  much.  For  example,  she told  me  that  although  she  believes  her  friend  has  ADHD,  she  does  not  give  her  enough  to  take  it on a daily basis for several reasons. She told me,

“I  made  it  clear  like  if  I  am  going  to  sell  this  to  your  or  give  it  to  you,  this  is  what  I  expect. 

Knowing  that  I’m  liable  and  you  can’t  challenge  what  I  say.  So  I’m  not  doctor  even  though 

I  don’t  prescribe  this  and  if  you  really  want  this  and  this  is  how  you  feel  and  I  trust  you, 

then  you  have  to  show  me  the  same  respect  and  acknowledge  what  I’m  saying.  So  she’s 

very good about it.”

As  more  and  more  people  found  out  about  Abby’s  Adderall  supply  and  approached  her  for the  drug,  she  became  increasingly  adamant  about  her  expectations  of  her  clients.  Her  biggest  fear was  that  they  were  trying  to  trick  her  in  order  to  obtain  the  drug  for  recreational  purposes  and,  as a  result,  would  end  up  getting  hurt.  One  of  the  primary  ways  she  determined  a  potential  client’s intentions  was  by  how  they  would  approach  her  for  the  drug.  She  told  me  that  she  is  more  likely to  give  it  to  a  person  who  shows  hesitation  asking  about  the  drug,  than  someone  who  outright 

asks  for  me.  She  explained  that  it  is  because  they  "have  a  concern  for  their  well-being  whereas the  people  who  just  walk  up  and  ask  it’s  like  do  you  want  to  ask  me  without  caring  what  I’m giving  or  selling  or  why  I’m  selling."  When  I  asked  her  why  that  was  important,  she  told  me  that a  person  who  does  not  care  about  their  own  health  is  not  some  she  would  trust  with  her  Adderall. 

She explained,

"It’s  the  whole  responsibility  aspect  where  I  feel  responsible  if  anything  happens  to  you 

and  if  you  are  irresponsible  and  immature,  why  would  I  want  to  make  myself  responsible 

for  that?  Buying  is  so  much  less  dramatic  I  guess.  Selling  is  like  you’re  responsible  if 

they overdose, like you’ve killed them."

For  Abby,  responsibility  should  be  shared  between  the  buyer  and  the  seller  and  is

negotiated  through  an  exchange  where  where  both  parties  acknowledge  and  respect  the  legal  and medical  risks  of  illicit  Adderall  use.  This  is  the  key  difference  between  the  way  she  sells Adderall  and  they  way  she  views  the  rest  of  the  stimulant  economy.  Abby  contextualizes  this 

frustration  with  irresponsible  buyer  and  dealers  when  she  told  me  a  story  about  a  girl  in  her biology  class  who  had  some  questions  about  trying  Adderall  for  the  first  time.  As  they  were 

sitting  in  the  lecture  hall  talking  about  ADHD  after  class,  another  student  named  Angela 

interrupted  and  offered  to  sell  her  Adderall  at  a  better  price.  Abby  told  me  it  felt  like  she  was  "a prostitute  on  a  comer  and  if  you  walked  up  and  tried  to  get  a  guy  and  make  money  off  him, you’re  crossing  a  boundary."  When  Abby  told  Angela  she  was  being  disrespectful,  Angela retorted  by  claiming  she  needed  the  money  more  than  Abby,  and  therefore  she  should  be  able  to put  a  bid  in  for  her  client.  Abby’s  frustration  in  this  situation  highlights  the  key  differences  she 

sees  between  herself  and  the  typical  Adderall  dealer.  The  analogy  of  Angela  as  the  prostitute 

literally  pressuring  the  “virgin”  drug  user  is  especially  telling  about  the  way  Abby  constructs  her 

own  moral  subjectivity.  While  Angela  is  more  concerned  about  who  is  entitled  to  the  sale,  Abby 

is worried about how this exchange affected her client, making her the more trustworthy party.

Abby  told  me  that  after  this  experience,  she  realized  that  there  was  a  time  and  place  to negotiate  the  drug  deal,  one  which  required  privacy,  honesty  and  mutual  respect.  This negotiation  or  initial  conversation  is  what  Abby  refers  to  as  “the  consultation”.  She  told  me  that whenever  someone  asks  her  for  Adderall,  she  told  them  that  she  will  only  consider  it  if  they  are willing  to  sit  down  and  talk  with  her  about  it  first.  Abby  told  me  that  at  this  point,  the  majority  of the  people  who  approach  her  usually  back  off,  which  in  itself  is  a  powerful  “weeding  out” process.  She  told  me,  "I’m  responsible  for  selling  to  you  so  if  you’re  not  comfortable  sitting 

down  with  me,  then  you’re  not  worth  my  time."  I  asked  her  if  she  is  concerned  that  they  will  go

and  purchase  the  drug  from  a  less  responsible  dealer.  She  responded  that  it  is  none  of  her business  what  they  want  to  do.  She  would  rather  spend  her  energy  investing  in  a  few  clients  who she knew she could help responsibly.

After  a  consultation,  Abby  also  sets  up  a  system  to  follow  up  with  her  clients.  She  told  me that  it  is  usually  less  structured  after  the  first  few  weeks  because  she  feels  like  her  clients  have enough  experience  to  manage  their  drug  experience.  At  the  same  time,  she  admits  that  there  is always  a  risk  when  it  comes  to  taking  powerful  prescription  stimulants.  I  asked  Abby  if  she could  minimize  that  risk  by  encouraging  her  patients  to  seek  professional  help  for  their condition.  She  told  me  that  no  matter  where  the  drug  comes  from  there  is  always  a  risk  and, 

"This  is  why  I’m  very  specific  to  who  I  sell  to  because  it  concerns  me  that  I’m  liable  and  I  think that anybody who sells should know that they’re liable and if they don’t they’re an idiot."

She  further  explained  all  of  the  possible  side  effects  of  taking  Adderall,  as  well  as  lesser known  facts,  that  could  impact  the  efficacy  of  the  drug,  like  consuming  it  with  orange  juice.  She told me,

"It  took  me  years  to  find  out  all  this  stuff  over  time  as  I’m  taking  this.  [My  doctors]  didn’t 

tell  me  all  this  up  front.  So  it’s  more  of  me  doing  studies  of  other  people  too  and  I’m  like 

okay  this  is  what  it  is  and  this  is  what  it  does  and  you  can  do  instead  of  this...  I  mean 

understanding  what  it  is  and  doing  more  studies  like  this  just  opens  up  a  world  of 

knowledge I don’t think that understanding is there. Thus,  although  Abby  believed  that  doctors  should  play  a  role  in  educating  patients  and supervising  their  ADHD  management,  she  feels  that  there  is  always  an  inherent  risk  with  drugs no  matter  where  they  come  from.  Moreover,  she  suggested  that  doctors  rarely  do  a  thorough  job informing  their  patients,  unlike  Abby  who  had  years  of  research  and  experience  with  her medication  and  could  share  that  knowledge  with  her  clients.  In  this  way,  Abby's  pharmaceutical expertise became the foundation to her identity as a responsible drug dealer.

As  a  pre-med  student,  and  a  person  with  ADHD,  Abby  morally  rationalized  her  approach to  selling  her  medication  through  a  rhetoric  of  both  authority  and  responsibility.  She  loathed  how the  drugs  was  being  sold  by  “clueless”  prescription  holders,  as  well  as  legally  by  indifferent 

doctors  who  charged  unreasonable  prices  and  never  followed  up  with  their  patients.  As  she 

continued  to  address  requests  for  the  drug,  these  concerns  evolved  into  ethical  criteria  and 

eventually  a  comprehensive  consultation  protocol  for  treating  and  monitoring  students  whom  she believed  suffered  from  ADHD.  During  the  consultation,  Abby  shared  her  own  experience  with the  condition  as  a  way  to  build  trust  with  her  clients.  At  the  same  time,  she  was  also  critical  of the  length  and  style  of  traditional  diagnoses.  For  that  reason,  Abby  crafted  a  new  agenda  for  her 

consultations,  which  she  felt  gets  more  to  the  heart  of  the  matter  without  all  of  the  extraneous 

components that would be taxing on someone with ADHD.

The  consultation  was  ultimately  a  way  for  Abby  to  determine  who  has  access  to  her medication.  It  served  both  as  a  way  to  diagnose  her  friends,  but  also  to  set  up  the  ground  rules 

and  expectations  for  the  drug  exchange.  Formalizing  the  process  made  Abby  feel  more  like  she was  providing  a  service  for  her  friends,  who  in  fact  need  the  help,  rather  than  someone  making money  off  selling  drugs.  At  the  same  time,  Abby  was  pragmatic  about  her  decision  to  sell  her medicines  -  the  prescription  costs money,  she  has  bills to  pay and she  is not  charging an  obscene 

amount.  She  also  referenced  other  dealers,  like  Angela,  who  claimed  she  did  not  need  the  money 

as  much a s t hey  do, ye t  she  does no t  see  it as  a  matter  of  financial  need. Ultimately, she  seemed to  understand  Adderall  dealing  as  a  private  agreement  between  two  people  where  both  parties’ 

goals are aligned.

Abby was also concerned with the responsibility that came with selling her medication.

She  often  referenced  other  Adderall  dealers  who  did  not  understand  how  serious  and  complicated the  distribution  of  Adderall  could  be.  Because  she  knew  so  much  about  ADHD  and  the  drug itself  through  research  and  personal  experience,  she  felt  she  had  more  of  an  authority  to  sell  her medication.  At  the  same  time,  she  was  highly  selective  about  the  types  of  people  she  offered  her services  to,  and  even  the  format  and  location  of  the  consultation,  in  order  to  maintain  agency over  the  drug  experience.  Although  she  went  to  other  people’s  homes,  she  as  the  one  running  the show.  Abby’s  relationship  with  her  therapist  was  also  a  key  contributor  to  how  interacted  with these  potential  clients  by  sharing  her  own  experience.  It  played  a  large  role  in  how  she understood  herself  as  a  person  with  ADHD  and,  eventually,  how  she  constructs  her  identity  as  a responsible drug dealer.

### **5.3  DISCUSSION**

The  biomedicalization  of  childhood  and  Adult  ADHD  in  the  late  1990s  and  early  2000s contributed  to  an  increase  in  the  number  of  students  entering  college  who  are  legally  medicated for  the  diagnosis.  Although  there  is  limited  data  on  the  dynamics  of  the  prescription  drug  dealer­ seeker  relationship  (Incardi  2009),  the  increased  availability  has  had  significant  effects  on  the perceived  value,  safety,  and  social  acceptability  of  sharing  and  consumer  these  medications (Quintero 2006).

My  research  suggests  that  the  illicit  Adderall  market  on  campus  can  triggered  a  series  of moral  breakdown  for  students  who  are  legally  medicated  for  the  condition.  The  breakdown  is facilitated  by  the  perceived  impunity  of  dealing,  the  demand  for  stimulants,  and  the  controversial nature  of  the  drugs  they  deal.  These  factors  have  significantly  shaped  the  values  and  experiences of  college  students  who  are  legally  medicated  for  ADHD  and  inform  their  experiences  when

encountering  Adderall  seekers.  These  factors  also  directly  set  the  prescription  stimulant  market apart from  other drug  markets and,  as a  result, shapes  how these  students perceive  themselves as empowered,  yet  responsible,  drug  distributors.  Moreover,  these  factors  influence  how  students evaluate  the  legitimacy  of  requests  from  Adderall  seekers  as  looking  to  get  high,  self-medicate, improve  studies,  or  some  hybridized  combination  of  these  uses.  Together,  these  factors contribute  to  an  ongoing  struggle  between  Adderall  dealers  and  seekers  to  properly  define  the responsible,  or  at  the  very  least  acceptable,  use  of  prescription  stimulants.  In  the  following sections,  I  discuss  how  Adderall  dealers  at  American  State  University  have  morally  positioned themselves, their  products, and  their consumers  in response  to these  social and  personal moments of moral breakdown.

**5.4.1  Practices: From Dealing Drugs to Governing Health and Performance**

The  drug  dealer-drug  seeker  relationships  presented  in  my  case  studies  were  based  on intersecting  social,  academic  and  medical  logics  that  served  a  number  of  purposes.  For  Becca, the  drug  deal  symbolized  her  investment  in  her  friendships  and  her  friend’s  dependence  on  her  as a  reliable  and  responsible  friend  who  could  supply  them  with  Adderall.  Her  decision  to  sell served  to  increase  her  social  capital  and  self-worth  within  her  growing  networks.  Because  the drug  is  such  a  foundational  part  of  Becca’s  identity  as  patient,  student,  and  peer,  it  is  hard  to distinguish  which  of  her  relationships  were  founded  on  and  facilitated  by  her  access  to  Adderall. We  see  this  when  Becca  panicked  over  her  inability  to  supply  Adderall  during  the  shortage  and  it becomes  clear  to  her  that  she  may  not  be  able  to  hold  up  her  end  of  the  relationship.  Despite  the obvious  drawbacks  to  this,  Becca  is  not  concerned,  but  rather  comforted  by  the  fact  that  as  long as she does have access to Adderall, her relationships will remain intact.

For  Mark,  the  occasional  drug  deal  was  in  the  context  of  helping  out  a  friend  in  need, rather  than  a  formal  transaction  for  social  or  financial  gain  -  motivations  he  attaches  to  the  “drug 

dealer”  identity.  Mark  was  not  particularly  interested  in  selling  his  Adderall  because  he  did  not want  to  be  liable  for  any  potential  side  effects  his  buyers  might  experience.  He  would  rationalize his  decision  to  do  so  by  only  selling  to  those  whom  he  considered  to  be  responsible  users.  This 

category,  for  Mark,  included  people  who  would  only  use  Adderall  for  academic  purposes  and never  for  recreation.  He  saw  recreational  users  as  irresponsible  and  likely  to  underestimate  the power  of  the  drug.  Avoiding  liability  was  his  primary  objective.  However,  we  nonetheless  see 

Mark  succumb  to  the  pressures  of  diverting  his  medication  even  when  he  did  not  feel 

comfortable.  Mark  grew  agitated  by  these  continual  advancements  and  begins  to  question  many 

of  his  social  relationships  and  interactions  with  friends  and  roommates.  Even  when  not  asking 

directly, he became almost paranoid, assuming that all they want is his medication.

Abby  also  expressed  her  frustration  with  peers  who  asked  her  outright  for  the  drug, viewing  this  behavior  as  a  sign  of  irresponsibility  and  disrespect.  For  Abby,  the  drug  deal  was  an honest exchange where  both pa rties’ intentions  and expectations are  aligned and  there is  a mutual respect  between  them.  To  accomplish  this,  Abby  eventually  developed  a  comprehensive protocol,  which  she  calls  the  consultation.  The  name  itself  served  to  distance  her  relationships 

from  the  traditional  dealer-seeker  exchange  and  reframe  it  as  a  professional  service.  Furthermore, this  re-framing  of  the  drug-deal  signaled  her  desire  to  maintain  agency  over  the  exchange. Although  Abby  saw  it  as  a  method  of  determining  who  has  ADHD,  it  ultimately  became  a 

strategy for her to justify whom she feels comfortable selling to.

**5.4.2  Objects: From Illicit Drugs to Social Benefits and Burdens**

By  refraining  Adderall  as  a  valuable  commodity  to  which  she  has  privileged  access, Becca  was  able  to  concurrently  reframe  her  identity  as  a  vulnerable  patient,  to  an  empowered drug  dealer.  Adderall  became  a  tool  in  her  evolution  from  immature  “prude”  to  mature  “badass” during  her college  years.  She came to  perceive the effects  of the  drug as  a performance  enhancer rather  than  a  mere  medication.  This  perception  allowed  her  to  feel  empowered  by  her  use  and connected  to  the  experiences  of  her  non-ADHD  friends,  who  use  the  drug  for  the  same  reason.  In this  sense,  Adderall  became  foundational  not  only  to  her  social  relationships,  but  also  her  identity as  a  normal  college  student.  Her  productive  view  of  the  drug  also  helped  her  rationalize  her unregulated  distribution  among  friend  and  acquaintances.  Her  only  apprehension  about  the  drug was  the  social  stigma  she  felt  when  she  was  younger.  Now  that  this  stigma  was  eliminated  in  the college context, Becca saw no reason not to use her medication to help her new friends.

For  Mark,  Adderall  went  from  being  a  potential  performance  enhancer  to  a  social  burden. It  is  unclear  whether  Mark  ever  truly  believed  he  had  ADHD  or  if  that  even  mattered  in  his decision  to  take  the  drug.  What  did  matter  for  Mark  was  the  intention  and  respect  he,  and  others had,  for  the  drug.  Stories  about  the  truant  high  school  kids  who  did  not  use  it  to  apply  themselves and  the  college  students  who  would  use  it  to  party  only  reaffirmed  his  belief  that  not  everyone deserved  access  to  the  drug.  For  Mark,  Adderall  was  only  for  those  who  would  use  it  safely  and in  appropriate  academic  situations.  The  dangers  of  Adderall  were  also  a  strong  consideration  as he  struggled  to  manage  the  strength  and  side  effects  of  ADHD  medications  at  various  points  in his  life.  Sizing  up  a  potential  buyer’s  ability  to  respect  and  handle  the  strength  of  the  drug  was  a strong  consideration  when  determining  who  he  would  sell  it  to.  Yet  with  each  pressured exchange, Mark began to view the drug as more of a social burden than a benefit.

For  Abby,  Adderall  has  and  always  will  be  a  medication  that  is  only  for  people  who  fit her  criteria  for  ADHD.  Although  she  was  apprehensive  about  her  own  drug  use  at  first,  her  rapid 

increase  in  dosage  and  the  positive  effects  in  her  social  and  academic  life  made  her  feel  like  she made  the  right  decision.  Moreover,  her  extensive  experience  gave  her  a  sense  of  expertise  over manipulating  and  harnessing  the  power  of  stimulants  to  manage  the  symptoms  of  ADHD.  Like 

Mark,  Abby  also  recognized  the  potential  dangers  of  stimulants,  which  is  why  she  spent  so  much time  educating  others  about  the  drug  before  she  sold  them.  As  a  result,  Adderall  also  served  as  a tool  for  her  to  help  others  until  they  could  be  formally  helped  through  sanctioned  medical 

channels.

**5.4.3  Subjects: Dealers/Seekers to Pharmaceutical Benefactors/Beneficiaries**

Although  each  individual  had  a  unique  construction  of  the  drug  dealer  identity,  there  are three themes  that emerged  across all  three case  studies in  various forms.  First is  the desire  to feel respected  by  the  potential  drug  seeker,  whether  it  is  by  approaching  them  in  an  appropriate  way, 

or  not  at  all,  and  showing  gratitude  for  the  transaction.  Mark  and  Abby  both  viewed  distributing Adderall  to  the  wrong  person  as  a  potential  liability  and  want  to  be  appreciated  for  the  risk  they 

are  taking.  For  Mark,  this  was  especially  important  because  he  did  not  have  the  surplus  that  both Abby  and  Becca  had  -  thus  making  his  Adderall  more  valuable.  For  Becca,  being  a  drug  dealer was  about  gaining  respect  by  selling  to  the  people  she  really  wants  to  incorporate  into  her  social network  -  especially  those  who  she  saw  as  being  popular  or  holding  some  social  status.  She justified her role by reminding herself that she was only selling to friends who needed her help.

Another  theme  that  emerged  was  the  desire  to  assert  one’s  authority  over  the  drug  deal. 

This  feeling  of  authority  came  from  a  number  of  sources.  For  all  three,  it  started  with  the  legal

access  to  the  drug.  We  saw  this  in  the  way  Becca  justifies  her  right  to  distribute  Adderall  because it  is  her  medication  and  she  can  do  what  she  wants  with  it.  This  emerged  also  in  how  Mark constructed  himself  as  understanding  the  importance  of  drug  intentionality  and  being  more cognizant  of  the  potential  negative  effects  because  of  his  past  experiences.  Abby  based  her authority  on  her  personal  experiences  as  well  as  her  close  relationship  with  responsible  medical professionals  and  her  pre-med  background.  In  all  three  cases,  a  failure  to  recognize  their authority or expertise became a sign that the seeker was not worthy of the drug.

Finally,  all  three  incorporated  some  explicit  dimension  of  morality  into  their  drug  dealer identity.  Mark  claimed  to  use  an  informal  moral  compass  to  guide  his  decisions,  implying  that  he is  fundamentally  a  good,  responsible  person  who  will  make  good  choices.  Abby  on  the  other hand,  developed  a  more  formalized  protocol  based  on  her  view  of  what  the  diagnostic  process should  be.  Becca  also  used  her  moral  judgment  when  she  claimed  only  to  sell  to  her  friends  who needed  her  help,  a  fact  that  sets  her  apart  from  the  irresponsible,  albeit  glamorized,  drug  dealer who  was  only  out  to  make  money.  However,  throughout  participant  observations,  it  became  clear that  the  inconsistencies  in  applying  these  strategies  serve  more  to  rationalize  morally  ambiguous decisions  after  the  fact,  than  make  them  in  the  first  place.  We  especially  see  this  when  Mark  gave into  the  pressure  to  sell,  Abby  continued  to  sell  to  Jennifer  despite  her  hesitations,  and  Becca realized that she may lose her friends if she is unable to refill her prescription.

### **5.4  CONCLUSION**

In  this  chapter,  I  have  illustrated  that  there  is  an  ongoing  struggle  among  college  students to  make  sense  of  and  maintain  agency  over  the  chemical  and  symbolic  transformation  that  comes from  consuming  Adderall.  I  argue  that  this  represents  a  key  moment  of  moral  breakdown 

167

associated  with  the  biomedicalization  and  pharmaceuticalization  of  performance  in  American 

college  culture.  I  take  this  as  a  departure  from  traditional  conceptions  of  the  illicit  drug  dealer 

and who are driven by purely economic interests or the desire to get high (Tunnell 1993).

I  used  a  combination  of  ethnographic  vignettes  and  interview  data  to  show  how  these 

students  move  away  from  purely  neoliberal  logics  of  financial  gain  to  create  new  forms  of moralized  pharmaceutical  subjectivity  in  response  to  this  breakdown.  They  rely  on  their positionality  to  stimulants  as  effective,  coveted,  but  potentially  dangerous  medications  as  a  way to  assert  their  agency  over  these  exchanges  and  present  themselves  as  responsible  drug beneficiaries.  This  includes  flexible  criteria  on  who  knows  about  your  Adderall  supply,  who  to 

give  it  to,  how  it  is  used,  what  it  is  used  for,  how  much  to  give  at  once,  if  and  how  much  to 

charge  for  it,  and  how  you  should  monitor  someone’s  use.  Yet  with  each  exchange,  the  symbolic meaning  of  stimulants  as  medications  becomes  unstable  as  students  struggle  to  determine  which 

seekers  are  worthy  of  their  valued  commodities.  As  a  result,  Adderall  dealers  must  strategically 

assert  their  identities  as  patient,  student,  or  friend  in  order  to  navigate  theses  morally  ambiguous 

exchanges  and  rationalize  their  decisions  to  conserve/distribute  these  powerful  drugs.  I  argue  that by  doing  so,  ADHD  students  are  in  my  study  were  able  to  respond  to  this  moment  of  moral breakdown  as  they  attempted  to  maintain  their  perceived  sense  of  responsibility  over  the responsible drug use of others.

In  the  following  chapter,  I  examine  how  these  moral  discourses  are  transmitted  and transformed  as  prescription  stimulants  are  illicitly  consumed.  I  describe  the  experiences  of 

college  students  who  are  tasked  with  defining  and  distinguishing  responsible  drug  behaviors  and maintaining  a  sense  of  moral  agency  over  the  drug  experience.  It  also  speaks  to  their 

168

positionality to Adderall dealers and medical service providers and how it influences their perceptions of responsible stimulant use.

**CHAPTER 6: CONSUMPTION**

This  chapter  looks  at  how  moral  ideologies  around  responsible  stimulant  use  from  the market,  treatment  and  circulation  landscapes  circumscribe  and  shape  the  consumer  experience.  It builds  on  anthropological  work  that  describes  the  experiences  of  the  strategic  drug  user,  a neoliberal  subject  who  empowers  themselves  through  the  strategic  consumption  of pharmaceuticals.  Here,  consumption  is  a  means  for  both  medical  and  social  transformation, 

defined  by  the  intentions  of  the  user,  the  context  in  which  the  use  occurs,  and  the  symbolic meaning  of  the  drug  itself.  I  also  draw  on  studies  from  the  health  and  social  sciences  that  look 

specifically  at  the  self-reported  motivations  and  behaviors  of  college  students  who  consume Adderall  without  a  prescription.  While  this  literature  provides  key  demographic  information 

about  this  drug  behavior,  it  largely  describes  illicit  Adderall  use  as  a  form  of  performance 

enhancement.  As  a  result,  it  fails  to  account  for  the  multiple  and  often  contradictory  moral  logics which  students  use  to  understand  and  express  their  controversial  behaviors  as  constitutive  of responsible stimulant use.

Building  on  this  literature,  I  consider  how  the  illicit  consumption  of  prescription 

stimulants  among  college  students  has  evolved  in  respect  to  pharmaceuticalization  in  the  last 

decade.  Increases  in  the  prevalence  of  this  behavior  has  raised  public  concerns  over  the 

intentions  and  actions  of  these  illicit  users.  I  use  media  reports  to  provide  key  insights  into  public 

discourse  surrounding  this  social  moment  of  moral  breakdown  and  highlight  the  ethical 

dilemmas  faced  by  college  students  who  have  illegal  access  to  prescription  stimulants.  I  situate these  dilemmas  within  the  university  stimulant  culture  and  illustrate  how  certain  factors,  such  as the  experimental  ethos  of  college  culture,  the  increasing  normalization  of  illicit  Adderall  use,  and 

170

the  simultaneously  productive/destructive  nature  of  the  drug  itself,  have  influenced  the 

consumption experience.

My  goal  in  this  chapter  is  to  understand  how  students  at  American  State  have  positioned themselves  and  stimulants  in  relation  to  both  social  and  personal  moments  of  moral  breakdown within  the  campus  stimulant  landscape.  To  accomplish  this,  I  conducted  twenty-four  months  of 

interviews  and  participant  observations  with  45  college  students,  documenting  their  experiences resisting  and  participating  in  Adderall  use  on  campus.  I  present  six  case  studies  that  highlight moments  in  which  students  interpreted  a  positive  or  negative  drug  experience  and  subsequently 

developed  strategies  to  make  themselves  feel  like  responsible  drug  users.  I  present  my  analyses 

of  these  case  examples  around  the  practices-subjects-objects  framework  to  systematically  map the  moral  discourses  that  surround  and  are  produced  through  the  modem  consumption  of prescription  stimulants.  I  conclude  the  chapter  with  a  discussion  of  how  this  analysis  informs 

conceptions and expectations of pharmaceutical morality and subjectivity in the US.

### **6.1  MORAL BREAKDOWN: MINIMIZING COSTS OR MAXIMIZING BENEFITS**

The  increase  in  illicit  prescription  stimulant  use  on  college  campuses  has  gained  the 

attention  of  scholars  across  various  fields  in  the  health  and  social  sciences.  Many  of  these  studies 

implicitly  describe  these  behaviors  through  neoliberal  logics,  framing  Adderall  use  as  an 

intentional  and  calculated  decision  to  increase  academic  performance  (Loe  et  al.  2006).  Some have  even  gone  so  far  as  to  endorse  the  availability  of  these  drugs  to  the  healthy  as  a  means  to 

improve  human  capacities  on  a  larger  scale  (Greely  et  al.  2008).  At  the  same  time,  the  increased normalization  of  this  behavior  has  raised  public  concern  over  the  implications  of  this  behavior  on 

issues  of  merit  and  success  in  the  university  setting.  As  a  result,  college  students  with  access  to

stimulants  are  faced  with  the  dilemma  of  failing  to  meet  performance  expectations  or  facing  the health, legal, ethical, and chemical consequences that come with consuming stimulants.

Media  reports  offer  insights  into  public  discourse  surrounding  this  moment  of  moral breakdown  and  the  highlight  the  ethical  dilemmas  faced  by  American  college  students.  For example,  the  issue  was  highlighted  on  April  25,  2010  during  a  segment  of  the  news  program  “60 minutes”  titled  “Boosting  Brain  Power.”  During  the  opening  sequence,  reporter  Katie  Couric asked  viewers,  “If  there  were  a  drug  that  would  make  you  smarter,  would  you  take  it?”  The morally  ambiguous  undertone  of  her  question  set  the  stage  for  the  rest  of  the  segment,  which centered  on  a  focus  group  of  eight  white  college  students  at  the  University  of  Kentucky.  She opened  the  conversation  by  asking  students  “how  common  is  it  to  see  friends  poppin’  pills during  finals?”  to  which  the  group  responded,  “it’s  the  norm.”  Her  informal  conversation  with these  young  people  about  “pill  poppin’”  was  spliced  with  commentary  from  medical  and  social science  researchers  -  a  framing  technique  that  showcased  the  dissonance  between  the  medical and  ethical  concerns  of  experts  and  casual  attitude  of  college  students  who  were  witness  to,  if  not active participants in, this controversial drug behavior.

Throughout  the  segment,  Couric  uses  the  term  “self-medication”  to  describe  the  illicit stimulant  use,  but  not  in  reference  to  the  treatment  of  self-diagnosed  ADHD.  In  fact,  she  made  a point  to  show  the  audience  a  neural  image  which  suggests  that  “Ritalin  works  in  a  healthy  brain the  same  way  that  it  does  in  a  brain  of  someone  with  an  attention  disorder.”  Rather,  her  use  of the  term  “self-medication”  was  meant  to  frame  illicit  Adderall  use  as  a  strategy  to  overcome  the academic  pressures  of  college  life.  In  doing  this,  it  seems  as  though  Couric  was  encouraging  the audience  to  remove  stimulants  from  the  auspices  of  medication  and  place  them  squarely  in  the realm  of  performance  enhancement.  From  there,  the  conversation  focused  exclusively  on  the 

172

###### Page 184

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_184_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_184_7.png)

medical  and  ethical  implications  of  using  Adderall  as  a  “brain  booster.”  Couric  interviewed  the 

director  of  the  National  Institutes  on  Drug  Abuse  (NIDA),  Nora  Volkaw,  who  warned  viewers 

against  the  addictive  and  psychosis-inducing  properties  of  stimulants.  However,  Professor  of 

Communications  at  Kentucky,  Alan  DeSantis,  who  has  conducted  numerous  studies  of  this  drug behavior,  argued  that  students  do  not  view  it  as  a  risky  drug  and  compare  its  effects  to  a  “stiff 

cup  of  coffee.”  He  explained  that  this  is  because  students  have  friends  who  have  been  on  the medication  legally  for  over  a  decade  without  issue  and  thus  see  no  harm  in  their  own  occasional use of the drug.

With  the  safety  of  the  drug  being  apparently  of  no  concern  to  students,  Couric  turned towards  the  efficacy  of  stimulant  use  in  her  interview  with  psychologist  and  researcher  Martha 

Farrah.  She  interviewed  a  number  of  subjects  from  Farah’s  study  on  the  effects  of  20mg  of Adderall  versus  placebo  on  healthy  individuals  completing  cognitively-oriented  tasks.  Farrah 

concluded  that  although  Adderall  can  increase  alertness,  it  may  also  hurt  performance  in  people by  suppressing  creativity  or  giving  them  “tunnel  vision”,  thus  missing  more  effective  methods  to 

solve  problems.  Alternatively,  featured  commentary  from  students  in  a  focus  group  suggests  that 

students  do  see  a  marked  improvement  in  their  ability  to  focus  on  tasks  and  “make  the  grade.” 

DeSantis  further  supported  these  claims  and  explained  that  according  to  his  research,  90%  of 

college  students  who  used  the  drug  believed  it  increased  their  final  marks  by  at  least  1  -2  letter 

grades.

Couric  rounded  out  her  segment  by  interviewing  an  Economics  Professor  at  Harvard  who 

openly  admitted  to  using  Adderall  throughout  college  and  during  his  career  to  help  finish  his 

latest  book.  His  professional  success  and  willingness  to  talk  about  his  illicit  drug  use  presents Adderall  as  a  de-stigmatized  method  to  improve  performance  within  the  academy.  Couric 

173

###### Page 185

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_185_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_185_7.png)

finished  the  segment  by  asking  the  focus  group  how  they  would  feel  if  Adderall  was  available  to anyone  without  a  prescription.  One  student  responded,  “I  guess  the  question  is,  ‘how  do  you  feel about it morally,’ and our general consensus is that most people are okay with it.”

The  issues  outlined  in  the  60  Minutes  news  segments  highlight  the  growing  tensions among  students  around  the  responsible  use  of  prescription  stimulants.  It  has  emerged  as  the result  of  a  number  of  factors  that  shape  this  new  stimulant  culture,  such  as  the  increasing normalization  of  illicit  Adderall  use,  and  the  simultaneously  productive/destructive  nature  of  the drug  itself.  In  this  chapter,  I  examine  how  illicit  Adderall  users  have  positioned  themselves  in order  to  navigate  this  morally  convoluted  environment.  Specifically,  I  ask  how  is  responsible stimulant  use  defined  and  facilitated  by  college  students  at  American  State  University  through the  consumption  of  prescription  stimulants?  How  do  these  practices  influence  and  embody shifting  expectations  around  the  responsibility  to  avoid/participate  in  stimulant  use?  In  the following  sections,  I  address  these  questions  and  examine  how  the  college  students  in  my  study framed  their  behaviors,  the  function  of  stimulants,  and  their  subjectivities  in  relation  to  these social and personal moments of moral breakdown.

### **6.2 CASE STUDIES**

The  data  in  the  chapter  is  based  on  24  months  of  interviews  and  participant  observations with  45  students  at  American  State  University  and  their  experiences  resisting/participating  in illicit  Adderall  use.  During  the  interview  phase,  students  were  asked  questions  about  their ideologies  and  experiences  as  they  related  to medical  factors  (ADHD,  Adderall,  pharmaceuticals, doctors); social  factors  (family,  peer  groups,  socialization,  drinking/drug  use);  and academic factors  (transitions  into  college,  college  culture,  study  habits,  grades).  Each  interview  lasted 

174

###### Page 186

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_186_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_186_7.png)

between  2-4  hours  and  was  tape  recorded  and  transcribed.  Interviews  were  coded  via  NVIVO 

around these  three primary  contexts and  then with  sub-codes related  to emergent  themes from  the 

data.

During  the  interview,  I  built  rapport  with  these  students  and  touched  base  with  each  of them  multiple  times  over  the  next  twelve  months.  Many  of  them  contacted  me  to  share  updates 

and  invited  me  to  social  events,  study  groups  and  private  residences  where  prescription 

stimulants  were  openly  discussed,  sought  after  and  sometimes  consumed.  I  also  witnessed  these 

conversations  and  behaviors  during  my  day-to-day  life  at  American  State  University  in  public 

spaces  such  as  the  library,  coffee  shops,  classrooms,  the  cafeteria  and  other  locations  where 

students  frequented.  At  first,  I  was  surprised  to  hear  students  talk  about  it  so  openly,  so  much  so that  when  I  would  talk  about  it  with  my  research  assistants  or  colleagues,  I  would  say  the  “Aword”  with  a  hushed  voice.  However,  I  soon  realized  that  Adderall  talk  among  students  is  as normalized  as  discussing  any  experimental  college  behavior,  like  drinking,  smoking  weed,  or having  sex.  They  would  talk  about  doing  it;  who  else  was  doing  it;  how  to  do  it  correctly;  where to  get  it  from;  why  it  is  a  good  idea;  and  occasionally,  why  it  is  a  bad  idea.  However,  comparing public  perceptions  to  what  I  observed  when  students  experiment  with  the  drug  in  private, 

suggests  that  the  glamorization  of  Adderall  as  a  “magic  bullet”  study  drug  did  not  tell  the  whole 

story.

In  this  chapter,  I  show  how  the  illicit  use  of  Adderall  by  students  American  State  can become  a  deeply  moralized  negotiation  of  health,  empowerment,  and  responsibility,  by  which new  biomedical  and  social  subjectivities  are  fashioned.  The  significance  of  practice  is  bolstered by  the  fact  that  experimenting  with  Adderall  is  not  only  normalized,  but  has  become  an  expected part  of  the  college  experience  for  many  of  these  students.  This  means  that  students  rarely  needed

a  reason  beyond  innocent  curiosity  or  justifiable  desperation  as  a  motivation  to  try  the  drug  in  the 

first  place.  However,  the  normalization  of  “trying  Adderall”  is  not  without  its  complexity,  a  fact that  I  realized  when  I  started  the  interview  process  and  found  that  students  had  vastly  different 

definitions of what constituted an Adderall user.

Of  the  45  students  I  interviewed,  23  were  initially  identified  as  “non-prescription  users”, 

11  as  “prescription  users”  and  11  as  as  “non-users”.  Yet  during  the  interview  process,  I  found that  some  “non-prescription  users”  used  to  have  prescriptions  for  the  drug  but  had  since  chose  to purchase  it  illegally  for  a  variety  of  reasons.  I  also  found  that  some  “prescription  users”  started  as 

“non-prescription  users”  but  subsequently  received  a  diagnosis  for  ADHD.  There  were  also  a number  of  “non-users”  who  admitted  to  using  Adderall  once  or  twice  a  long  time  ago,  but 

considered  themselves  “non-users”  because  they  do  not  consider  themselves  Adderall  users.  I began  to  rethink  the  stability  of  these  categories  -  what  exactly  was  I  trying  to  compare  by  using them:  Who  had  a  prescription  at  exactly  the  moment  I  interviewed  them?  How  recently  they  had 

consumed  Adderall  and  whether  or  not  that  single  incident  now  permanently  labeled  them  as  a user?  As  I  listened  to  their  stories  I  realized  that  these  labels  were  in  fact  an  obstacle  to  capturing the  complex  logics  they  used  not  only  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  “try  Adderall”  but  how  they 

eventually  interpreted  their  behavior  as  ir/responsible  drug  use.  In  response,  I  reorganized  my 

demographic  breakdown  to  account  for  any  use,  past  or  present  to  provide  some  indication  of their  experience  and  how  it  influenced  these  perspectives  (see  Chapter  1  for  demographic 

information).

The  students  I  interviewed  drew  on  a  combination  of  economic,  social,  and  medical 

logics  to  make  sense  of  and  maintain  agency  over  the  chemical  and  symbolic  transformation  that 

comes from consuming Adderall. This includes rules about where they access their medications;

modes  of  consumption;  and  what  types  of  academic  work  are  both  logically  and  ethically 

appropriate  for  pharmaceutical  interventions.  Yet  with  each  swallowed  pill,  the  symbolic meaning  of  stimulants  as  self-medication,  enhancement  and/or  recreation  becomes  unstable  as 

students  struggle  to  justify  their  controversial  behaviors.  As  a  result,  students  must  constantly  re­

assert  boundaries  between  their  moral  selves  and  the  potentially  immoral  pharmaceutical practices  in  which  they  engage.  I  argue  that  through  the  negotiation  of  boundaries  these  students 

are able to rationalize their behaviors as a form of responsible, albeit illicit, drug use.

In  the  following  sections,  I  present  six  case  examples  from  drug  users  with  whom  I became  well  acquainted  during  this  study.  While  each  participant  at  some  point  made  the 

decision  to  "try  Adderall"  or  eventually  use  it  without  a  prescription,  the  way  they  strategically position  themselves  as  responsible  drug  users  varies  greatly.  Each  constructed  persona  serves  to 

ethically  rationalize  their  participation  in  this  controversial  practice,  and  illustrates  the  complex value  systems  they  created  out  of  necessity.  By  coupling  interviews  and  participant  observations, the  following  cases  show  how  students’  moralized  self-constructions  compare  to  their  lived 

experiences as students, friends, patients, and drug users.

**6.2.1  Shannon: Responsibility as Seeking Health Care**

It  was  the  beginning  of  spring  semester  and  I  was  sitting  at  the  kitchen  table  with 

Shannon,  a  freshman  in  biology.  She  had  asked  me  to  come  with  her  to  her  mother’s  house  for 

“moral  support”  when  she  decided  to  tell  her  that  she  wanted  to  get  tested  for  ADHD.  After 

almost  an  hour  of  chatting  about  school  and  family,  Shannon  finally  mustered  up  the  courage  to bring  up  the  issue  at  hand.  She  began,  “Mom,  you  know  that  I  really  care  about  school,  right? 

Like I am really trying my best.” Her mother looked concerned as she nodded her head. “I know.

Your  grades  were  really  great  last  semester.  What  are  you  trying  to  tell  me?”  she  asked.  Shannon replied  “Well,  I  think  I  have  ADHD.”  Shannon  began  telling  her  mother  how  she  had  been taking  Adderall  without  a  prescription  for  about  three  months  and  that  she  had  never  felt  more 

focused.  She  was  worried  that  her  mother  would  be  angry  with  her  for  using  the  drugs  illegally but  to  her  surprise,  she  seemed  relatively  calm.  Shannon's  mother  listened  carefully  and  began  to 

ask  questions  about  where  she  got  the  drugs  and if  there were  any  side  effects.  Shannon  assured her  it  was  from  a  trusted  friend  and  that  Adderall  was  completely  safe,  especially  for  people  who needed  it  like  her.  Shannon's  mother  began  talking  about  her  own  issues  with  focus  and wondered  if  she  too  had  ADHD.  We  spent  the  next  half  hour  gathered  around  Shannon's 

smartphone,  googling  videos  about  the  condition  and  the  effects  of  Adderall  on  the  brain.  She then  told  Shannon,  “Well,  I  am  glad  you  told  me  about  this  but  I  don’t  think  you  should  be taking  someone  else’s  medication.  Let’s  talk  with  the  doctor  and  decide  what  to  do  from  there.” A  month  later,  both  Shannon  and  her  mother  obtained  legal  prescriptions  for  Vyvanse  and  began to take the medication on a daily basis.

When  I  first  interviewed  Shannon,  she  was  struggling  to  decide  if  the  increased  focus  she 

felt  with  Adderall  was  evidence  that  it  was  just  a  “study  aid”  or  if  it  was  evidence  that  she  had ADHD.  Like  many  of  the  informants  in  my  study,  she  had  tried  the  drug  for  the  first  time  during 

finals week  the night  before a  big paper  was due.  Shannon had  never used  any other  drugs, street 

or  prescription,  for  “moral  reasons”  so  she  had  no  point  of  comparison  when  it  came  to 

evaluating  the  physiological  effects  of  Adderall.  However,  the  fact  that  she  did  not  experience 

any  negative  side  effects  lead  her  to  feel  more  and  more  comfortable  with  using  the  drug  on  a regular  basis.  After  using  it  weekly  for  over  a  semester,  she  told  me  that  she  started  to  feel  guilty 

about the improvement in her grades and wondered if she was somehow “cheating the system”.

She  had  never  considered  the  possibility  of  having  ADHD  before  her  first  experience  with Adderall  because  she  was  never  “hyperactive”  or  had  problems  paying  attention  in  class. 

However,  now  that  she  knew  that  the  drug  was  “working”  for  her,  she  did  some  research  on ADHD and felt like she might meet the criteria.

Following  this  research  into  ADHD,  Shannon  told  me  that  she  asked  her  friends  what they  thought  and  they  believed  that  she  probably  did  not  have  this  disorder.  However,  she  said they  encouraged  her  to  try  to  obtain  a  script  so  she  could  contribute  to  their  supply.  After  some thought,  she  decided  that  the b est course  of action  was  to be  tested for ADHD  so she  could come 

clean  to  her  parents  about  her  Adderall  use  and  take  the  drug  the  “responsible  way”.  After  she 

obtained  a  legal  prescription,  I  asked  Shannon  if  she  would  share  her  Adderall,  like  her  friends 

assumed,  and  she  told  me  that  she  did  not  think  of  Adderall  as  a  study  aid  anymore,  but  a medication.  As  a  result,  Shannon  felt  like  she  had  more  of  a  right  to  take  the  drug  than  her 

friends  because  she  actually  has  ADHD,  as  evidenced  by  her  doctor’s  official  diagnosis  of  both herself and her mother.

**6.2.2  Peter: Responsibility as Engaging in Self Care**

It  was  the  Tuesday  after  spring  break  and  I  was  walking  into  a  coffee  shop  off  campus  to meet  with  Peter,  a  sophomore  in  history.  We  were  supposed  to  meet  that  afternoon  so  he  could tell  me  about  his  appointment  with  his  family  doctor  to  talk  about  getting  a  legal  prescription  for Adderall.  I  took  my  seat  and  we  talked  about  what  we  did  over  break  and  his  plans  for  the 

semester.  After  about  20  minutes  of  waiting  for  him  to  bring  it  up,  I  finally  asked  him  what happened  at  his  doctor’s  appointment.  He  leaned  back  in  his  chair  and  told  me  that  he  thought 

about  it  for  a  while  but  ultimately  decided  not  to  go  through  with  setting  up  the  appointment 

179

because  “it  wasn’t  worth  the  hassle”.  When  I  asked  him  what  he  means,  Peter  reminded  me  that the  only  reason  he  wanted  to  go  to  the  doctor  in  the  first  place  was  to  get  a  regular  supply  of Adderall  so  he  would  not  have  to  keep  bothering  his  friends  for  it.  However,  after  he  found  out how  much  it  would  cost  to  get  the  testing  done  and  fill  a  prescription  without  using  his  parent’s 

insurance, he realized it would be much cheaper to just buy the substance illegally.

I  asked  Peter  if  he  still  thought  he  had  ADHD.  He  told  me  that  he  knows  he  does  but  it  is not  as  severe  as  other  people  so  he  could  manage  with  obtaining  Adderall  from  his  friends  on  an 

“as  needed  basis”.  I  asked  him  if  he  would  feel  confident  in  telling  other  people  that  he  did  in 

fact  have  ADHD  without  an  official  diagnosis.  Peter  laughed  and  told  me,  “like  I  need  to  pay 

some  doctor  to  convince  me  I  have  ADHD?”  He  told  me  several  stories  about  students  he  had heard  of  who  have  the  diagnosis  but  faked  it  to  get  a  prescription  for  Adderall.  He  told  me  these 

stories  made  him  doubt  the  legitimacy  of  the  diagnostic  process  and  as  a  result,  helped  him rationalize his decision to not get tested.

During  our  initial  interview,  Peter  told  me  that  he  knew  he  had  ADHD  for  as  long  as  he 

could  remember  because  his  grades  were  always  up  and  down  and  he  could  not  concentrate  in 

classes.  When  a  few  of  his  friends  started  receiving  diagnoses  for  the  condition  in  high  school,  he had  brought  up  the  idea  with  his  parents.  He  told  me  that  they  did  not  believe  in  ADHD  and thought  Peter  was  just  using  it  as  an  excuse  for  his  poor  academic  performance.  Over  the  next 

four  years,  he  struggled  in  school  but  never  tried  Adderall  because  he  was  afraid  his  parents would  be  upset  with  him,  and  did  not  think  it  was  worth  the  consequences.  Once  he  was  in 

college,  however,  Peter  found  that  a  lot  of  people  were  using  Adderall  without  a  prescription  and he was curious as to what it would do for him.

Peter  tried  Adderall  for  the  first  time  before  an  exam  and  felt  “laser-focused”  on  the 

questions.  He  used  it  again  a  couple  of  days  later  to  study  for  a  different  exam  and experienced  a heightened  sense  of  confidence  as  he  moved  through  the  materials.  He  began  buying  the  drug regularly  from  his  roommate  and  used  it  a  couple  of  times  a  week  to  work  on  assignments  or  pay 

attention in his lectures. He saw his grades significantly improve.

Peter  explained  that  after  feeling  the  positive  effects  of  Adderall,  he  felt  both  frustrated 

and  vindicated.  Frustrated  that  he  clearly  had  ADHD  and  his  parents  and  teachers  had  failed  him by  not  taking  his  concerns  about  the  possibility  of  the  condition  seriously.  He  felt  vindicated  that he  no  longer  needed  their  permission  to  finally  address  the  one  thing  that  was  standing  between him  and  a  successful  academic  experience.  However,  because  Peter  knew  how  his  parents  would 

feel,  he  decided  to  keep  it  a  secret  from  them  and  seek  out  a  prescription  on  his  own,  which  he was  able  to  do  as  an  adult.  When  the  costs  of  the  diagnosis  and  the  drugs  itself  became  a  barrier to  Peter’s  plan,  he  turned  to  his  ability  to  self-diagnose,  in  spite  of  the  adults  in  his  life,  as 

evidence  that  he  knows  what  is  best  for  himself.  In  this  case,  it  meant  using  Adderall  without  a prescription to treat his undiagnosed ADHD.

**6.2.3  Erica: Responsibility as Avoiding Dependency**

I  was  attending  class  at  a  local  yoga  studio  when  I  saw  one  of  my  informants,  Erica,  a 

senior  in  physiology,  take  the  instructor’s  place  at  the  front  of  the  room.  I  had  met  her  almost  12 months  earlier  when  I  did  my  initial  interviews  but  had  subsequently  lost  touch  with  her  when 

she  stopped  returning  my  emails  and  text  messages.  She  spotted  me  during  class  and  gave  me  a 

gentle  squeeze  on  the  back  to  let  me  know  that  she  recognized  me.  After  the  session,  she  came 

over  and  apologized  for  “falling  off  the  face  of  the  earth”  but  promised  me  that  I  would  forgive

her  once  I  knew  the  whole  story.  We  decided  to  grab  some  coffee  next  door  which  is  when  Erica told me that she had been in rehab for almost six months because of her addiction to Adderall.

I  listened  carefully  as  she  described  her  battle  with  the  drug,  which  she  began  taking 

illegally  her  freshman  year  before  she  eventually  obtained  a  legal  prescription.  It  was  during  her time  in  rehab  that  she  took  up  yoga  and  later  became  a  certified  instructor  so  she  could  support herself  when  she  returned  to  school.  She  told  me  that  although  she  had  heard  of  “Adderall 

abuse”,  she  never  thought  she  would  be  "one  of  those  people".  I  asked  her  to  tell  me  what  that means  and  she  described  the  feeling  of  not  being  able  to  get  out  bed  in  the  morning  without  first taking  the  drug,  and  the  withdrawals  she  experienced  when  she  tried  to  quit  on  her  own.  I  asked her how  she thought  it was  possible to  become addicted  to her  own medication,  and she  asserted, 

“doctors  don’t  really  understand  how  dangerous  these  drugs  are.”  She  compared  Adderall  to  the 

street  drug  Methamphetamine  and  reminds  me  that  they  are  just  “one  methyl-group  apart.”  She 

asks  me  if  I  have  "tried  it  yet"  and  I  shake  my  head.  She  looks  relieved  and  told  me,  “Good! Never  ever  take  that  shit,  Taz.  It's  not  worth  it.  Just  stay  away  from  it  no  matter  how  good  it 

sounds. Even if you think it’s gonna help, it is not worth it.”

When  I  first  interviewed  Erica,  she  had  already  begun  questioning  her  constant  use  of  the 

drug  and  told  me  that,  “it  was  more  trouble  that  it  was  worth.”  Like  many  students,  she  had  taken Adderall  for  the  first  time  during  finals  week  her  freshman  year  to  find  that  the  drug  “worked” 

for  her.  At  first,  she  would  only  use  it  for  high-stakes  assignments,  like  exams  and  term  papers. 

Eventually,  however,  she  used  it  to  clean,  work  out,  or  just  feel  more  “social”  at  parties.  She 

interpreted  her  constant  desire  to  use  the  drug  as  evidence  of  undiagnosed  ADHD,  not  an 

addiction  problem.  Other  friends  were  using  Adderall  daily  with  a  prescription  so  she  felt  it  only made  sense  to  become  diagnosed  herself.  After  going  through  a  formal  assessment,  Erica

###### Page 194

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_194_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_194_7.png)

received  a  legal  prescription  from  her  family  doctor  at  the  beginning  of  her  sophomore  year.  She told  me  that  her  doctor  never  talked  with  her  about  the  potential  to  abuse  the  drug  and  even encouraged  her  to  take  an  extra  pill  if  she  “really  needed  it  that  day.”  Eventually,  she  needed  an extra  pill  every  day,  which  became  an  issue  because  her  friends  would  ask  her  for  her  medicine but she did not have any left for herself, let alone to share.

At  the  end  of  this  first  interview,  Erica  told  me  that  she  was  considering  not  refilling  her prescription  because  she  did  not  like  the  way  it  makes  her  feel  anymore,  but  was  tom  because she  did  not  want  her  grades  to  drop  either.  She  was  especially  concerned  when  her  pills  were stolen  from  her  apartment  during  a  house  party  and  she  was  too  embarrassed  to  ask  her  doctor for  a  refill  so  she  just  bought  the  drug  illegally  for  the  rest  of  the  month.  I  asked  Erica  if  she  felt like  she  could  talk  to  her  doctor  or  her  parents  about  what  was  happening  and  she  said  that  she does  not  want  them  to  freak  out  and  think  that  "she  is  a  drug  addict  or  something"  and  that  she can  handle  it  on  her  own.  During  that  time,  she  still  viewed  Adderall  as  a  medication,  rather  than an  illicit  substance.  Although  she  knew  it  was  similar  to  Meth,  she  told  me  the  comparison  did not really register with her because it legally came from a doctor.

**6.2.4  Jenna: Responsibility as Managing Dependency**

It  was  a  Tuesday  night  at  the  beginning  of  spring  semester  and  I  was  sitting  on  the  couch with  Jenna,  a  senior  in  economics.  We  were  at  her  apartment  and  Jenna  was  going  through  her course  syllabi  with  me,  trying  to  figure  out  how  much  Adderall  she  would  need  to  get  through the  semester.  Because  she  considered  herself  an  “Adderall  expert”,  Jenna  was  able  to  tell  me exactly  when  she  though  she  might  need  Adderall  and  exactly  how  many  milligrams  is  needed  to complete  each  assignment.  She  pointed  to  a  reflection  paper  for  an  elective  philosophy  course 

183

###### Page 195

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_195_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_195_7.png)

and  told  me  “that  is  only  worth  like  1%  of  my  grade  so  I  don’t  need  any  Adderall  for  that”.  It  is not  until  she  comes  to  the  high-stakes  assignments,  like  her  economics  final,  which  would  take 

"at least  a twen ty, ten  to study  and ten  for the  exam." She  told me  that although  she feels  like she needs  Adderall  to  help  her  get  through  finals,  she  did  not  like  how  she  felt  when  she  overloaded her  system  with  the  drug  in  just  a  couple  of  days.  Jenna  looked  at  her  planner  and  counts  back three weeks  from the  end of  the semester  and put  a star  next to  Sunday with  a green  gel pen.  She told  me,  “this  is  when  I  will  buy  my  Adderall  for  finals.  Ten-5s  [mg],  ten-lOs  [mg]  and  five-20s 

[mg].”  She  explained  that  in  order  to  avoid  getting  sick,  she  started  taking  the  5mg  tablets  every 

other  day,  then  the  lOmg  tablets  every  day  and  then  the  20mg  pills  as  needed  for  her  finals.  She 

also made  sure to  buy a  couple ounces  of weed  for the  end of  the semester  to help  “cancel out  the 

speediness”  of  Adderall  and  help  her  get  to  sleep  at  night  so  she  can  resume h er st udies t he  next 

day.  Jenna  also  told  me  that  she  never  uses  Adderall  to  write  the  final  draft  of  a  paper,  because 

every  time  she  does,  it  turns  out  to  be  “complete  rambling  bullshit”.  For  that  reason,  she  will write  a  rough  draft  of  her  history  paper  two  weeks  before  the  deadline  when  she  is  starting  on  the 

5mg  tablets,  and  just  needs  the  “motivation  to  get  started.”  Once  she  has  a  draft,  Jenna  will  edit the paper during one of her off days before she moves onto the 10-mg tablets.

During  our  initial  interview,  Jenna  told  me  that  she  was  diagnosed  with  ADHD  by  her 

family  doctor  her  senior  year  of  high  school  and  took  Adderall  every  day  through  her  freshman year  at  American  State.  However,  she  eventually  felt  like  she  was  becoming  dependent  on  the 

drug  to  get  anything  done,  not  just  school  work,  but  cleaning,  exercising  and  socializing.  I  asked her  if  there  was  a  moment  when  the  realization  hit  her  and  she  told  me,  "When  I  lost  more  than twenty  pounds  in  just  a  couple  months,  that’s  when  I  knew  it  had  gone  too  far".  Jenna  had 

stopped  filling  her  prescription  her  junior  year  and  decided  to  quit  cold  turkey  without  her

parents  finding  out.  She  told  me  that  they  would  freak  out  if  they  knew  she  was  not  taking  her medication  anymore.  However,  quitting  was  much  harder  than  she  thought  it  would  be  and  she 

experienced  severe  withdrawal  symptoms  which  caused  her  to  almost  drop  out  of  school  at  the beginning  of  her  sophomore  year.  She  told  me  that  although  she  could  have  refilled  her prescription,  she  no  longer  trusted  herself  with  sixty-ninety  pills  at  once.  She  decided  that  the best  course  of  action  was  to  start  buying  Adderall  illegally  from  her  friends  as  a  way  to  regulate her  use.  Because  she  felt  somewhat  embarrassed  to  ask  for  more  than  a  couple  of  pills  at  a  time 

from  any  one  person,  the  awkwardness  itself  is  a  good  regulation  system.  Jenna  also  told  me  that now  that  she  has  been  regulating  her  own  use  for  over  two  years,  she  had  become  somewhat  of 

an  expert  on  how  to  best  use  Adderall  to  maximize  its  benefits  and  minimize  its  side  effects.  I 

asked  her  if  she  felt  like  her  existing  ADHD  diagnosis  made  her  feel  like  she  has  a  right  to  buy the drugs illegally. She told me that that she felt more responsible doing it this way.

**6.2.5  Megan: Responsibility as Maintaining Integrity**

It  was  the  Monday  of  finals  week  and  I  was  studying  with  Megan,  a  sophomore  in 

chemistry.  We  sprawled  out  in  one  of  the  study  rooms  in  the  dorms  with  four  of  her  classmates 

from  her  organic  chemistry  class  who  were  also  preparing  for  the  final  exam  tomorrow.  Megan had  been  up  since  6:00AM  because  she  had  picked  up  an  extra  shift  working  at  the  university 

coffee  shop  at  the  library  to  earn  some  extra  money  to  save  up  for  a  study  abroad  program  next 

spring.  Although  she  had  unlimited  access  to  coffee,  it  was  clear  by  the  redness  of  her  eyes  and the  continuous  and  contagious  yawning  that  Megan  was  fading  fast.  By  11:00PM,  the  group  still had  three  chapters  to  review  for  the  exam  and  Megan  told  the  group  that  she  might  have  to  call  it 

a  night  so  she  can  some  sleep  before  the  test.  Eric,  a  young  man  in  her  study  group  offered  to 

185

###### Page 197

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_197_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_197_7.png)

share  one  of  his  Adderall  with  her  if  she  wanted  to  keep  studying,  assuming  she  would  accept. 

Megan  looked  at  me  and  said  jokingly  “I’ll  only  take  one  if  Taz  does.”  I  smiled  and  told  her 

“nice  try."  Everyone  at  the  table  laughed.  Eric  also  laughed,  but  again  he  extends  the  offer  again. 

Megan  smiled  sincerely  and  replied  “Thanks  buddy,  but  I  got  this.”  We  stay  for  another  hour before  Megan  and  I  left  and  I  drove  her  back  to  her  apartment  across  campus.  In  the  car,  I  asked her  how  she  felt  about  what  happened  and  she  told  me  that  she  appreciated  his  offer  but  she  did not  feel  like  she  needed  it.  I  asked  her  if  she  felt  weird  taking  the  Adderall  with  me  being  there, but  she  reassures  me,  and  replies  “I  know  you  wouldn’t  judge  me  Taz,  but  really,  I  just  didn’t need  it.”  She  continued  to  tell  me  that  people  like  Eric  should  not  feel  bad  about  taking  Adderall 

since they needed it but she has learned that for her, it is just unnecessary.

Although  she  did  not  use  it  that  night,  Megan  admitted  to  me  during  our  initial  interview that  she  had  indeed  tried  Adderall  before.  In  fact,  the  drug  was  offered  to  her  by  Eric  during  a 

study  session  last  semester,  much  like  the  one  we  had  attended  together  that  evening.  She 

described  the  situation  as  one  of  desperation.  She  was  always  a  good  student  but  was  having  a hard  time  finding  time  to  study  because  her  parents  were  having  financial  troubles  and  she  had  to pick  up  another  part  time  job  on  campus.  The  pressure  of  a  full  course  load  and  demanding  work 

schedule  was  beginning  to  take  its  toll  as  Megan  struggled  to  stay  awake  in  class,  let  alone prepare  for  final  exams.  She  had  seen  Eric  become  “super-focused”  after  taking  an  Adderall before  class  or  when  studying  for  exams  throughout  the  semester.  So  when  he  offered  it  to  her that  night,  she  “had  a  moment  of  weakness”  and  thought  “well  let  us  just  see  what  happens.”  I 

asked  Megan  if  she  thought  Adderall  was  a  performance  enhancer  and  she  told  me  that  it 

definitely  kept  her  awake  but  she  was  not  sure  if  it  actually  improved  her  exam  scores.  I  asked her  if  she  felt  like  it  was  cheating  to  take  the  drug  and  she  told  me  “well,  not  really  cheating

because  it  didn’t  actually  help  me  retain  any  information.  At  least  I  don’t  think  it  did?  So  I  would 

say no.”

Megan  went  on  to  tell  me  that  her  parents  would  be  really  disappointed  in  her  if  they knew she  had used  the drug  because she  does not  need Adderall  to be  a good  student -  just more 

discipline.  I  asked  her  if  she  thinks  it  is  cheating  when  other  students  use  it  and  she  says,  “I  don’t know,  probably  not  because  they  really  might  need  it.”  Megan  told  me  that  she  believed  that  any 

advantage  they  achieve  on  the  test  would  be  outweighed  by  the  fact  that  they  would  not remember  it  down  the  road.  And  if  they  did,  it  is  probably  because  they  had  ADHD  and 

legitimately needed the drug.

**6.2.6  Justin: Responsibility as Taking Initiative**

It  was  the  Sunday  before  finals  week  and  I  was  hanging  out  in  the  kitchen  with  Justin, 

Max,  and  Eddie,  all  juniors  at  American  State  who  were  also  roommates.  I  sat  at  the  table  and watched  the  three  rummage  around  the  kitchen  assembling  the  ingredients  to  make  an  impressive meal  of  pancakes,  eggs,  hash  browns  and  sausage.  As  they  began  cooking,  each  told  me  about his  finals  week  schedule.  Justin  told  me  “three  exams  and  a  twenty-page  paper,  but  I  am  done  by 

Thursday.”  Max  chimed  in,  “I  got  you  beat.  I  have  four  exams,  and  one  is  on  Friday  morning.  At 

8:00AM!”  The  three  cringed  together  at  the  thought.  Eddie  told  me  that  he  lucked  out  because  he 

only  had  two  papers  to  write  and  both  were  due  on  Friday,  but  he  had  not  even  started  the research  on  them  yet.  Although  they  were  laughing,  I  could  feel  the  nervous  energy  fill  the  room 

as  we  sit  down  to  finally  eat  our  unusually  large  breakfast.  The  rest  of  the  conversation  turned towards  plans  for  summer  break  and  the  “debauchery”  that  will  ensue  once  the  three  of  them  are 

finally  free.  It  would  start  off  with  a  party  at  their  house  on  Friday  night  to  help  them  recover

from  the  “PTSD”  from  finals  week.  As  the  three  finished  their  meals,  Eddie  pulled  out  two baggies  with  four  30mg  pills  each  and  hands  them  out  to  his  friends.  He  also  pulled  out  a  single pill  from  of  his  prescription  bottle  for  himself  and  sets  it  on  the  table.  They  each  take  a  pill,  and raised  them  -  much  like  toasting  a  glass  of  champagne  -  and  say  loudly  in  unison,  "Fuck  you, 

finals!" before swallowing them. We cleaned up the kitchen, and headed to the student union.

I  had  interviewed  Justin  earlier  that  semester  which  is  when  he  first  described  to  me  the 

finals  week  ritual  that  his  roommates  had  created  to  foster  solidarity  before  "entering  into  battle". 

The  three  had  been  friends  since  their  freshman  year  of  college  when  they  lived  in  the  dorms together.  That  was  when  Eddie  first  shared  his  Adderall  with  Justin  and  Max,  which  according  to 

Justin, would be the act that laid the foundation to their friendship for the next four years.

Justin  told  me  that  before  coming  to  know  Max  and  Eddie,  Justin  was  an  “average  student”  who had  ambitions  of  doing  something  great  with  his  life  but  never  quite  had  the  motivation  or 

initiative  to  get  started.  As  a  result,  his  grades  were  just  good  enough  to  get  into  American  State, but  within  a  semester,  he  was  on  academic  probation  for  failing  almost  every  class.  Justin  told me  that  he  never  really  took  school  seriously  and  was  used  to  disappointing  his  parents.  But when  the  reality  of  his  probation  sunk  in  and  he  knew  he  would  have  to  explain  this  to  his parents,  he  became  severely  depressed.  When  Max  found  out  about  Justin’s  problem,  he  offered him  an  Adderall  that  he  had  received  from  Eddie  and  told  Justin  that  it  was  the  only  way  to  make 

it  through  finals  week.  Justin  had  drunk  and  smoked  marijuana  before  but  had  never  tried Adderall  or  any  other  prescription  drug.  He  decided  to  give  it  a  try  and  told  me  that  it  turned  him 

into  a  “study  machine”  and  that  it  definitely  improved  his  grades.  At  the  same  time,  he  recounts moments  where  he  did  not  use  Adderall  “the  right  way”  and  ended  up  cleaning  his  room  or 

“creeping  on  Facebook  for  eleven  hours”  instead  of  studying.  He  also  found  that  if  he  did  not

drink  enough  water  or  eat  before  he  took  the  drug,  he  would  lose  his  appetite.  After  three  or  four 

days  straight,  the  effects  would  be  unbearable,  which  is  a  big  part  of  why  the  three  of  them 

developed  the  “breakfast  before  battle”  ritual  in  the  first  place.  When  I  asked  Justin  if  he  feels 

guilty  for  using  Adderall  or  what  his  parents  think  of  his  drug  use,  he  told  me,  “My  parents  don’t know  that  I  use  Adderall.  But  if  they  did,  they  wouldn’t  be  mad.  They  would  be  proud  of  me  for taking initiative and doing better in school.”

### **6.3  DISCUSSION**

Some  medical  anthropologists  have  argued  that  the  increasing  availability  of pharmaceuticals  through  both  sanctioned  and  illicit  channels  has  generated  a  sense  of  agency 

among  Americans  who  feel  they  could  benefit  from  these  technologies  for  both  medical  and nonmedical  purposes  (Vuckovic  and  Nichter  1997;  Petryna  and  Kleinman  2006;  Tone  and Watkins  2007).  This  process  requires  an  increase  in  self-surveillance  by  the  user  and  the  belief that  pharmaceuticals  could  quickly  and  effectively  improve  medical  and  social  circumstances 

(Clarke  et  al.  2006).  In  particular,  the  increase  in  drug  marketing,  flexibility  of  ADHD  diagnoses, 

and  the  pressures  of  college  life  encouraged  young  people  to  seek  out  legal  prescriptions  for 

stimulants  (Conrad  2005).  At  the  same  time,  Abraham  (2010)  notes  that  biomedicalization  theory 

alone  is  not  sufficient  in  explaining  the  growth  in  the  prevalence  in  ADHD  diagnoses;  we  must 

also  take  into  consideration  the  expanding  power  of  drugs  in  American  society.  This  is  especially true  in  the  context  of  illicit  stimulant  use,  which  has  in  some  cases  become  entirely  disassociated with  the  original  disorder  and,  in  other  cases,  has  become  even  more  entangled  with  it  (often preceding and encouraging the diagnosis). In this framework, the illicit consumption of Adderall

presents  an  opportunity  to  improve  health  and/or  cognitive  performance  issues  that  serve  as 

obstacles to academic success.

My  research  suggests  that  the  increased  availability  of  stimulants  at  American  State  can trigger  a  series  of  moral  breakdowns  for  students  with  access  to  these  drugs.  The  increased prevalence  and  publicized  normalization  of  this  illicit  drug  behavior  has  lead  the  public  to 

question  the  intentions  and  actions  of  students  who  seek  out  and  consume  these  medications. 

Medications  that  were  promoted  by  the  pharmaceutical  industry  and  health  care  providers  as having  the  power  to  improve  mental  health  and  social  performance  are  now  the  source  of  the moral  dilemmas  that  are  associated  with  pharmaceuticalization.  The  strategic  drug  user  had become  a  victim  to  irresponsible  advertising,  diagnoses,  and  a  culture  that  promoted  performance 

over  health.  This,  coupled  with  the  experimental  ethos  of  college  life  and  the  normalization  of this  drug  behavior  have  lead  to  an  ongoing  struggle  among  students  in  properly  rationalizing their  participation  in  this  contentious  drug  behavior.  In  the  following  sections,  I  discuss  how these  illicit  Adderall  users  have  morally  positioned  themselves  in  response  to  this  moment  of moral breakdown.

**6.3.1  Practices: From Transformation to Experimental Practice**

My  research  illustrates  how  college  students  have  attempted  to  empower  themselves through  the  use  of  prescription  stimulants  while  attempting  to  avoid  or  lessen  the  myriad  medical 

and  social  side  effects.  Although  each  origin  story  is  unique,  all  of  the  users  from  these  case 

examples  initially  used  the  drug  to  improve  their  academic  performance.  However,  the  way  they 

interpreted  and  rationalized  this  improvement  varied  from  managing  symptoms  of  ADHD,  to pushing  past  their  natural  limits,  to  reaching  their  full  potential,  to  coping  with  the  struggles  of

finals  week,  to  gaining  the  motivation  to  do  the  work.  This  is  because  these  students  draw  on  a variety  of  complex  moral  logics  to  interpret  the  negative/positive  chemical  and  symbolic transformations  they  experienced  through  their  consumption  of  Adderall.  As  a  result,  each  had  a unique  understanding  of  what  constituted  responsible  or  irresponsible  Adderall  use,  and 

developed  strategies  to  mitigate  the  medical  and  social  side  effects  of  the  drug.  This  included rules  about  when  and  where  they  accessed  their  medications;  modes  of  consumption;  and  what types  of  academic  work  are  both  logically  and  ethically  appropriate  for  pharmaceutical 

interventions.  However,  these  rules  changed  over  time  as  students  continued  their 

experimentation  with  Adderall  while  attempting  to  maintain  a  sense  of  agency  over  the  drug transformation.

For  Shannon,  responsible  Adderall  use  meant  seeking  a  legal  prescription  through  a 

licensed  medical  professional.  Although  she  was  treating  what  she  interpreted  as  the  possible 

symptoms  of  undiagnosed  ADHD  without  a  prescription,  she  felt  guilty  about  hiding  her  drug use  from  her  parents.  Similarly,  Peter  interpreted  his  improvement  on  Adderall  as  a  sign  of ADHD,  and  although  he  considered  the  benefits  of  obtaining  a  prescription,  he  did  not  think  it was  worth  the  money  or  the  effort.  Moreover,  he  was  skeptical  that  a  medical  professional  would 

even  diagnose  him  properly,  and  felt  that  he  could  better  manage  his  ADHD  on  his  own  as needed,  even  if  it  meant  taking  Adderall  illegally.  While  both  students  articulated  their  illicit  use 

of  Adderall  as  self-medication,  their  personal  interpretations  of  the  drug  transformation  were 

informed  by  existing  and  evolving  beliefs  about  ADHD,  the  role  of  doctors,  and  the  ethics  of 

consuming a drug in secret/illegally to improve their grades.

Others  held  legal  prescriptions,  yet  interpreted  the  drug  transformation  as  a  possible  sign 

of  addiction  or  abuse.  Although  she  was  diagnosed  with  ADHD,  Jenna  felt  like  she  knew  more 

191

about  the  drug  and  its  potential  side  effects  than  her  doctors  and  did  not  trust  herself  with  so many  pills  at  once.  For  her,  responsible  drug  use  meant  regulating  the  frequency  and  purpose  of her  consumption,  even  if  it  meant  buying  the  drug  illegally  from  friends  rather  than  filling  her 

own  legal  prescription.  On  the  flip  side,  Erica  sought  a  diagnosis  for  ADHD  after  taking Adderall  illegally  on  occasion  -  only  to  become  addicted  once  she  had  a  legal  prescription.  For her,  there  is  no  such  thing  as  responsible  Adderall  use  because  the  drug  is  simply  too  dangerous. While  both  Jenna  and  Erica  participated  in  legal  and  illegal  Adderall  use  and  were  concerned with  the  potential  for  misuse  and  abuse,  they  each  developed  individual  strategies  to  maintain 

agency  over  the  drug  experience,  by  controlling  it  or  avoiding  it  completely.  These  examples  are particularly  hard  to  classify  within  existing  frameworks  because  their  relationship  to  Adderall 

changed  so  dramatically  since  their  initial  consumption.  It  also  illustrates  the  problems  with 

labeling  users  at  any  given  period  of  time  based  on  their  motivations  alone  because  both  students 

are  still  motivated  to  do  well  in  school.  However,  the  role  of  Adderall  and  their  responsibility  in the  actual  drug  experience  is  directly  influenced  by  their  interpretation  of  the  transformation  that 

occurred when partaking, both immediately and over time.

For  Megan,  responsible  Adderall  use  meant  only  using  the  drug  if  you  really  needed  it. Although  she  admits  she  first  used  the  drug  in  a  desperate  attempt  to  complete  academic  work, 

she  eventually  convinced  herself  that  it  did  not  actually  improve  her  performance,  although  it might  for  other  people  who  were  not  as  disciplined  as  her  or  had  ADHD.  Although  she  was  able to  complete  the  assignment,  she  does  not  credit  Adderall  with  that  accomplishment  -  for  her  the transformation  was  ineffective.  Her  interpretation  of  a  failed  transformation  helped  her  to rationalize  her  decision  to  never  take  the  drug  again.  This  interpretation  further  excuses  her  from taking  the  drug  in  the  first  place  because  if  it  did  not  work,  it  is  not  cheating.  Alternatively,  Justin

saw  Adderall  use  as  the  only  way  to  cope  with  the  demands  of  finals  week,  which  was  a  large part  of  his  responsibility  as  a  college  student.  For  him,  the  transformation  was  essential  to  his academic  success,  as  evidenced  by  his  improved  grades.  Thus  the  act  of  taking  Adderall  was one of  fulfilled  academic  responsibility.  Moreover,  it  was  at  the  foundation  of  an  elaborate  ritual  that was both socially acceptable and empowering.

**6.3.2  Objects: From Magic Bullets to Moral Meanings**

While  these  students  used  a  variety  of  labels  to  describe  Adderall,  such  as  “medicine", 

"study  aid",  "drug”,  or  “addy”,  the  word  itself  was  not  a  consistent  reflection  of  how  they believed  it  functioned  or  transformed  them.  In  fact,  students  would  often  use  these  terms interchangeably  depending  on  who  they  were  with.  For  example,  Justin  and  his  friends  called  the drug  “blast”,  which  was  a  term  only  his  inner  circle  knew.  On  several  occasions  I  heard  them  say things  like  “are  you  blasting  right  now?”  or  “let  me  get  some  blast”  as  a  way  to  talk  about  their drug  use  in  front  of  others  without  being  questioned  or  put  in  a  position  where  they  would  feel pressured  to  share  their  drugs.  However,  most  people  just  called  the  drug  “Adderall”  -  even  when it  was  Vyvanse.  This  is  because,  as  a  word,  “Adderall”  holds  symbolic  meaning  within  popular culture.  It  is  a  catch  all  for  its  multiple  perceived  functions  and  effects.  This  flexible  cultural symbol  is  tangled  with  the  individual  experiences  which  give  the  drug  a  complex  meaning  that  is perhaps  impossible  to  capture  with  the  medication/enhancement/recreation  framework.  As  my case  examples  illustrate,  Adderall  does  not  only  move  between  these  boundaries,  it  blasts  them apart.  The  user  is  then  left  to  piece  together  what  they  think  the  drug  means  to  them  with  each swallowed pill.

Before  Shannon  took  Adderall,  she  saw  it  as  a  popular  study  drug  that  could  help  her 

focus  and  improve  her  performance.  It  was  only  once  she  started  feeling  guilty  about  her 

continued  use  that  she  considered  the  possibility  of  having  ADHD.  Her  exploration  of  the 

condition  and  motivation  to  fit  into  the  flexible  category  is  a  key  example  of  self  diagnosis  via 

drug  efficacy.  It  is  impossible  to  know  whether  she  really  believed  she  had  the  condition  or  if  it was  just  an  interpretation  that  allowed  her  to  maintain  a  moral  sense  of  self.  Moreover,  by viewing  it  as  a  medication,  she  could  now  seek  out  a  diagnosis  and  prescription  that  would  allow her  daily  access  to  the  drug  without  feeling  like  she  was  cheating  the  system  or  breaking  the  law. 

It also meant she no longer had to lie to her parents.

Peter,  who  claimed  he  always  believed  he  had  ADHD,  took  Adderall  for  the  first  time  as 

a  study  drug  and  and  immediately  interpreted  its  positive  effects  as  validation  of  his  self­

diagnosed  condition.  Unlike  Shannon,  he  does  not  see  Adderall  as  a  daily  necessity,  but  rather  a medication  that  should  be  used  as  needed.  Although  this  may  indicate  a  view  of  ADHD  that  is temporary  or  not  as  severe,  it  could  also  just  be  a  perspective  he  constructed  to  deal  with  the  fact that  he  could  not  afford  to  gain  regular,  sanctioned  access  through  a  doctor.  Instead,  he  was willing to re-adjust his values and continue to purchase it illegally from his friends.

While  Shannon  and  Peter  seemed  to  have  a  sense  over  the  chemical  transformation  that Adderall  provides,  Jenna,  Erica  and  Justin  were  more  aware  of  their  necessary  participation  in the  consumption  process.  Jenna  believed  she  could  harness  the  power  of  Adderall  through 

calculated  consumptions  in  which  she  only  uses  the  drug  to  do  the  tasks  necessary  and  nothing 

else.  This  management  allowed  her  to  feel  like  she  is  in  control  and  not  succumbing  to  the temptation  to  use  the  drug  for  irresponsible  purposes.  Justin  also  creates  a  ritual  around  the 

consumption  process  in  order  to  avoid  the  physiological  side  effects  of  dehydration  and  loss  of 

194

appetite.  For  him,  however,  the  consumption  process  is  at  its  core  a  social  experience  -  partaking with  his  friends  makes  him  feel  like  they  are  all  participating  in  a  rite  of  passage  and  suffering  in 

solidarity.  This  acted  to  curb  any  social  stigma  that  might  arise  from  their  illicit  use  of  the  drug. 

Of  the  three,  Erica  is  the  weariest  of  the  power  of  Adderall  and  decides  that  it  is  impossible  to 

control  the  drug  experience.  Although  it  started  as  a  legal  medication,  it  quickly  became  an 

addictive  substance  -  something  she  recognized  when  the  adults  in  her  life  did  not.  She  saw  it  as 

a  dangerous  drug  whose  benefits  as  a  medication  or  enhancer  was  outweighed  by  the  costs  of 

consumption.  As  a  result,  the  only  way  for  her  to  control  the  experience  was  to  avoid  it 

altogether.

Adderall  also  had  a  motivational  function  for  all  three  in  that  they  used  it  to  drive themselves  to  do  academic,  and  sometimes  non-academic,  work.  Justin  saw  this  as  the  primary purpose  of  the  drug  because  it  motivated  him  to  get  his  work  done,  despite  his  grueling  finals week  schedule.  However,  Jenna  only  wanted  motivation  for  appropriate  academic  tasks  and nothing  else,  which  is  why  she  had  to  be  so  calculated  about  her  use.  Finally,  Erica  also  found herself  using  it  to  “get  out  of  bed  in  the  morning”  and  did  not  want  to  rely  on  the  chemical motivation.

**6.3.3  Subjects: From Strategic Users to Pharmaceutical Interpreters**

My  study  illustrate  how  these  students  relied  on  a  number  of  moral  logics  to  not  only make  decisions  about  their  consumption,  but  to  rationalize  their  behaviors  as  a  form  of responsible,  albeit  illicit,  drug  use.  In  particular,  they  relied  on  social  and  individual 

experimentation  to  determine  if  and  how  they  could  benefit  from  the  drug  and  whether  or  not they  were  willing  to  deal  with  the  social  and  medical  side  effects.  My  case  examples  suggest  that 

195

###### Page 207

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_207_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_207_7.png)

these  decisions  were  not  based  purely  on  neoliberal  goals  of  performance  enhancement,  but  also 

included  moral  judgments  to  articulate  their  pharmaceutical  choices.  In  particular,  the  students  in my  study  continuously  re-asserted  boundaries  between  their  moral  selves  and  the  potentially 

immoral pharmaceutical practices in which they were engaged.

Megan  constructed  a  self  that  does  not  need  the  transformation  that  Adderall  provided, marking herself  as a  responsible and  perhaps moral  person. She  does not  see herself  as a ch eater, but  as  someone  who  tried  the  drug  once  with  positive  intentions  and  made  the  responsible 

decision  to  never  do  it  again.  She  is  a  responsible  student  because  she  works  really  hard  for  her 

grades  and  cares  about  retaining  the  information.  As  she  does  not  want  to  disappoint  her  parents by taking drugs illegally, she may also consider herself a responsible daughter.

Similarly,  Peter  assumed  responsibility  by  constructing  a  self  that  selectively  needs  the transformation  that  Adderall  provided.  He  does  not  see  himself  as  a  bad  student,  but  someone who  needs  medication  to  manage  his  ADHD  symptoms  from  time  to  time.  He  does  not  rely  on 

doctors  or  his  parents  to  take  care  of  his  health  needs,  taking  responsibility  for  his  own  needs.  He 

cares  about  improving  his  performance,  even  if  it  means  taking  drugs  illegally  -  delineating himself as a responsible student.

Constructing  a  self  that  selectively  needs  and  controls  the  transformation  Adderall provided,  Jenna  does  not  see  herself  as  an  ADHD  patient  or  drug  user,  but  rather  as  an  Adderall 

expert  who  knows  how  to  use  the  drug  responsibly.  She  is  a  responsible  patient  because  she recognizes  the  power  of  Adderall  even  when  her  parents  and  doctors  do  not.  As  she 

systematically  plans  out  her  use  and  knows  exactly  how  to  use  it  to  maximize  its  positive  effects while minimizing its negative ones, she is also a responsible student.

Similar  to  Megan,  Erica  identifies  as  someone  who  does  not  need,  and  actively  avoids  the transformation  Adderall  provided.  She  does  not  see  herself  as  an  ADHD  patient  or  a  drug  addict, but  rather  a  victim  of  the  drug.  In  recognizing  the  negative  effects  of  the  drug  even  when  her parents  and  doctors  did  not,  she  is  acting  responsible  for  her  own  health.  She  identifies  as  a  good 

student because  she recognized  her misuse  and sacrificed  her good  grades so  she could  take care 

of  herself  and  go  to  rehab.  She  is  also  repairing  her  mind  and  body  through  Yoga  and  using  the money  to  put  herself  through  school.  In  warning  others  about  the  dangers  of  Adderall,  Erica 

exercises responsibility in acting as a good and wise friend.

Justin  does  not  see  himself  as  a  lazy  or  stupid  student,  but  someone  who  is  doing  what  it takes  to  get  through  finals  week,  assuming  responsibility  by  constructing  a  self  who  wants  to 

control  the  transformation  Adderall  can  provide.  He  takes  the  initiative  to  receive  good  grades, 

even if  it is  at the  expense of  his health.  His use  is responsible  because he  tries to  take care  of the physiological  side  effects  by  eating  breakfast  and  drinking  water.  He  participates  in  an  Adderall ritual  with  his  roommates,  which  creates  a  sense  of  solidarity,  as  well  as  a  system  of 

accountability,  reiterating  the  responsibility  of  his  actions  and  marking  him  as  a  good,  supportive 

friend.

Shannon  does  not  see  herself  as  a  cheater  or  drug  user,  just  someone  who  needs  the medication  to  manage  her  ADHD  symptoms  -  fully  accepting  the  transformation  Adderall  can provide.  As  she  chooses  to  treat  her  condition  the  right  way  by  seeing  a  doctor  first,  she  can 

separate  herself  from  the  category  of  irresponsible  Adderall  users.  She  acts  as  a  responsible 

student  because  she  is  working  hard  to  improve  her  grades  and  Adderall  is  a  part  of  her  success 

strategy.  Choosing  to  be  honest  with  her  mother  and  encouraging  her  to  also  seek  treatment  for her undiagnosed ADHD marks her as a responsible and good daughter.

**6.4 CONCLUSION**

In  this  chapter,  I  provided  evidence  of  an  ongoing  struggle  within  these  college  students to  make  sense  of,  and  maintain  agency  over,  the  chemical  and  symbolic  transformation  that comes  from  consuming  Adderall.  I  examined  this  as  a  key  moment  of  moral  breakdown associated  with  the  biomedicalization  and  pharmaceuticalization  of  performance  in  American college  culture.  I  take  this  moment  of  breakdown  as  a  departure  from  previous  neoliberal conceptualizations  of  of  pharmaceutical  subjectivity  in  which  individuals  feel  empowered  by increased  pharmaceutical  consumption  (Fox  et  al.  2005).  Instead,  I  consider  the  range  of  moral subjectivities  and  experiences  that  emerge  from  access  to  pharmaceuticals  in  the  modem  college environment.

I  used  a  combination  of  ethnographic  vignettes  and  interview  data  to  show  how  these students  use  both  neoliberal  and  moral  logics  to  justify  their  stimulant  use.  In  the  process,  they create  new  forms  of  moralized  pharmaceutical  subjectivity  that  addresses  these  social  and personal  moments  of  moral  breakdown.  Specifically,  they  relied  on  their  interpretations  and create  strategies  to  mitigate  the  medical  and  social  side  effects  of  the  drug.  This  included  rules about  where  they  access  their  medications;  modes  of  consumption;  and  what  types  of  academic work  are  both  logically  and  ethically  appropriate  for  pharmaceutical  interventions.  Yet  with  each swallowed  pill,  the  symbolic  meaning  of  stimulants  as  self-medication,  enhancement  and/or recreation  became  completely  unstable  as  students  struggled  to  justify  their  controversial behaviors.  As  a  result,  students  must  constantly  re-assert  boundaries  between  their  moral  selves and  the  potentially  immoral  pharmaceutical  practices  in  which  they  engage.  I  argue  that  by  doing so,  these  students  are  able  to  rationalize  their  behaviors  as  a  form  of  “responsible”,  albeit  illicit, drug use.

**CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION**

In this dissertation, I presented an anthropological account of how some US college 

students are constructing and managing their moral subjectivities through engagements with prescription stimulants. I used a combination of ethnographic methods to explicate the moral 

logics students used to address dilemmas that came with seeking, circulating and consuming these drugs within a college setting. These methods included formal and informal interactions with students and health services providers at my field site who were, to various degrees, tied to the Adderall economy on campus. I presented analyses of several direct-to-consumer (DTC) 

drug marketing campaigns and news media reports to illustrate the ways in which moral 

discourses can be diffused through peripheral economic, medical, and academic landscapes to 

inform the user experience. This included messages around the safety, fairness, legality, and 

efficacy of these drugs, which in combination contributed to diverse definitions of “responsible” 

stimulant use in the university setting.

I based my analyses of this data around Zigon’s (2007) concept of “moral breakdowns” to anthropologically illustrate if and how students acknowledged these ethical concerns during their engagements with stimulants. Specifically, I examined at how students experienced Adderall use as an unreflective moral choice to manage academic performance, or one that could trigger personal moments of moral breakdown. By combining interviews with participant 

observations, I was able to witness these moments firsthand as students were made to reflect on their pharmaceutical experiences - either for the first time during the interview, or in their day to 

day lives as students, patients, dealers, seekers and users. I provided case examples to illustrate these moments and the various moral strategies students used to work through these dilemmas in 

order to continue operating productively and unreflectively in a pharmaceuticalized environment.

Together, my findings suggest that engagements with prescription stimulants have become a fundamental part of how numerous students construct themselves and are constructed by others as healthy, empowered, and responsible individuals. This is because under the process 

of pharmaceuticalization, the marketing, treatment, circulation, and consumption of these drugs has become part of daily life for many Americans. This is especially true in the context of 

college life, where participating in experimental and risky behaviors, such as drug use, is a 

fundamental part of the cultural ethos for many students. At the same time, this normalization has come under scrutiny in light of scholarly and media reports, which portray stimulants as potentially dangerous, illegal, unethical, unproductive substances that can cause more harm than 

good. As a result, individuals in my study were, at various moments, pulled from their unreflective moral states and forced to address concerns over facilitating, failing to prevent, or participating in irresponsible stimulant use.

The multi-method approach employed in this study provided the means to observe 

students’ lived experiences along Adderall against the imagined life of prescription stimulants that were described during initial student interviews. I compared this imagined life with 

conceptions of Adderall use that are commonly presented by the media, pharmaceutical 

advertisers, and the health service providers with whom I interacted at American State University. I discuss how drug promoters/providers developed criteria to define responsible Adderall use to rationalize their decisions to facilitate or deny college students access. In Chapter

3,1  provided examples of how companies like Shire Pharmaceuticals strategically protected their 

interests by supporting what appeared to be a clear delineation between responsible and 

irresponsible stimulant use in the college environment. These distinctions were based on 

endorsing legal and sanctioned access to stimulants, as determined by informed collaborations 

200

between patients and their doctors. This strategy served to delegate both the benefits and burdens 

of the drug back to the consumer and the medical professionals who are charged with prescribing 

and monitoring their use.

In subsequent chapters, I illustrated how these imaginary boundaries between responsible 

stimulant use became increasingly flexible as Adderall begins its material life and travels through contexts of treatment, circulation and, eventually consumption. In Chapter 2,1 situated this flexibility within the contentious history of stimulants and attention disorders in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as well as evolving modem economic, medical and 

academic environments in which these drugs currently operate. It is this flexible quality of Adderall as a medication, enhancement, and recreational drug which makes it seem so 

empowering in the college environment. This flexibility enabled both the users and providers in my study to mold its symbolic meaning into a form that would compliment or enhance their moral sense of self, and help them rationalize their pharmaceutical practices.

Significantly, my research also illustrated how this empowering flexibility can lead to 

instability as students were forced to adjust their definitions of responsible Adderall use to 

account for the various social and medical implications that accompanied access to these drugs. 

This includes complex concerns over medical non-compliance, malingering, social stigma, drug 

dealing, academic dishonesty, and addiction. The strategies informants developed to preclude 

and respond to these moments of moral breakdown, and the multiple functions of Adderall within these rationales, were documented by my multi-method approach. As a result, my research provides ethnographic evidence to better understand how students are managing the 

simultaneously productive and destructive aspects of prescription stimulant use.

I argue that my articulation of the flexible versus unstable boundaries between Adderall as a medication/enhancement/recreational drug is a key contribution to the project of pharmaceutical anthropology. My framework extends beyond describing boundaries between good and bad drug behaviors, and instead seeks to capture the moral ambiguity these boundaries represent. Moreover, it offers a way to articulate the benefits and costs of this ambiguity to the provider/users who engage with these powerful drugs. The notion of flexibility versus instability speaks directly to Whyte et al.’s (2002:15) argument that although pharmaceuticals may seem to empower their user, “control can lead to being controlled” by the drug through addiction, or by drug providers through processes of medicalization. Using prescription stimulants as a case study, my research highlights the moral dimensions of this slippery slope and provides ethnographic data to show how this can occur. Moreover, it describes the strategies some US college students have developed in order to maintain a sense of moral agency over their Adderall experience.

### **7.1  PHARMACEUTICALIZATION**

The case examples presented in this dissertation were limited to those key informants who actively avoided, circulated or consumed prescription stimulants. My goal was to illustrate how their engagements with Adderall figured into their day to day lives at American State University as well as their moral sense of self. In many ways, their experiences embodied Dumit and Greenslits’ (2006) description of pharmaceuticalization as an all encompassing force where students unreflectively reach for prescription stimulants to manage their ethical identities. This was evidenced by the normalization of Adderall on campus and the fact that many of the students I interviewed told me they had never seriously considered the ethical implications of the 

202


---

###### Page 214

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_214_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_214_7.png)

behavior. In these cases, it was the interview itself which triggered a moral breakdown and 

forced the student to work through the potential dilemma and explain to me why they felt their behaviors aligned with their moral sense of self.

At the same time, there were also students in my study who discontinued their Adderall use because they no longer saw it as a productive or ethical choice for them. These decisions were usually preceded by a moment of moral breakdown in which they had to reconcile the various implications that came from their use of the drug. Together, these positive and negative 

accounts supported Abraham’s (2010) description of the access-oriented versus injury-oriented 

consumer who could consciously accept or reject pharmaceuticalization. However, I found that while some of my informants developed moral boundaries around their own Adderall use, they rarely passed judgments on peers who continued to use the drug. This is likely due to the fact that students are socialized to be accepting of each other's individual choices, especially around risky behaviors like illicit drug use in the college environment.

The students in my study seemed to be, for the most part, operating unreflectively in an 

environment where prescription stimulant use is a normal and sometimes expected part of the 

college experience. However, I found that these periods of unreflective morality were punctuated with moments of breakdown in which students, for a variety of reasons, had to stop and consider how their drug behavior was compromising their moral sense of self. Sometimes, these moments were reconciled as flukes, or a single poor decision on the part of the user. Often these moments were used to inform new consumption or circulation strategies - including the decision to cease their drug use. A few students in my study experienced a traumatic moral breakdown when they realized that their Adderall use had transitioned from a form of ADHD or performance management to addiction. In these situations, students felt a complete loss of moral agency over 

203

###### Page 215

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_215_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_215_7.png)

the drug experience. In one instance, a student used this experience to warn others about the 

dangers of Adderall use, and contribute to what Abraham (2010) refers to as “depharmaceuticalization” in the university setting.

In each of these cases, students regained their sense of moral agency by adjusting their 

own behaviors or expectations to better fit their pharmaceuticalized surroundings. In other words, when Adderall’s empowering flexibility turned into instability, students themselves became unstable, which triggered the moral breakdown. To recover, they learned to become 

flexible subjects either by adjusting their definitions of morality or by adjusting the way they 

interacted with the drug to meet their moral expectations. Throughout this dissertation, I have provided detailed ethnographic examples of how this transpired in various contexts: marketing, treatment, circulation and consumption. In the following sections, I describe some of the patterns that emerged when analyzing data from within and across these contexts and how they contribute to and better understanding of pharmaceutical morality in the U.S.

### **7.2  MORAL PHARMACEUTICAL PRACTICES**

My dissertation contributes to an understanding of pharmaceutical morality by 

considering the role of drug promoters or providers in constructing and managing the moral boundaries around prescription stimulants. These individuals are responsible for determining which students should have access to Adderall and what constitutes responsible use in contexts 

of DTC drug advertisements, the diagnosis treatment and accommodations of ADHD, and illegal 

drug deals between students. However, due to the increasing complexity of the economic, medical, and academic landscapes in which these providers operate, I argue that these 

individuals are also faced with concerns over managing the flexibility/instability of prescription 

204

###### Page 216

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_216_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_216_7.png)

stimulants in the college environment. In particular, the evolving definitions of ADHD and the 

emergence of multiple, competing modalities of ADHD treatment has increased the flexibility 

and subsequent instability of Adderall as a legitimate medication. Moreover, the demand for 

stimulants in the college environment for potentially immoral purposes lead many of the drug providers in my study to create or adjust strategies to preclude or respond to the moral breakdowns that came from marketing, prescribing, and dealing ADHD medications at American 

State.

Although these providers had diverse definitions of responsible Adderall use, I found that they often employed similar strategies when morally framing their interactions with drug 

seekers. The most common of which was establishing a sense of authority over the pharmaceutical practice through claims of expertise. During DTC drug marketing and ADHD treatment, this predominantly referred to formal credentials such as coaching certifications or medical degrees. It also included professional experience such as original research, number of publications, years of assessment work, or high ranking positions within professional 

organizations. As Adderall moved through treatment and into circulation and consumption 

stages, I found more stakeholders making claims to informal expertise. This included reference to personal experience such as suffering from ADHD, having family or close friends with the 

condition, or personal experiences with prescription stimulants. In particular, many of the student 

dealers I interviewed referred to personal research and experimentation with Adderall, which they believed made them more suitable to facilitate the drug use of their fellow students than 

some doctors with formal training.

The Adderall/ADHD experts in my study translated their claims to expertise into a variety of structured protocols which served to justify why they held the power to decide who 

205


---

###### Page 217

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_217_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_217_7.png)

ultimately has access to prescription stimulants. I provided examples of the generic selfassessments and ADHD resources that Shire manufactured to establish their expertise on ADHD. I also showed how some health service providers also use multiple assessments to diagnose ADHD and determine who has access to not only stimulants, but academic resources. Even the 

student drug dealers in my study had some form of protocol or disqualifying criteria which they would refer to when rationalizing why one peer deserved their medication over another.

At the same time, I found that at every level these criteria were, in themselves, highly modifiable and in the end, left open to interpretation. Sometimes, this flexibility served to increase access to prescription stimulants. This was especially true for the generalized quizzes 

and resource materials featured on Shire’s website, with the implicit aim of increasing selfdiagnosis among consumers. This was also the case for many of the health service providers and dealers in my study who believed they were helping students by facilitating access to Adderall to 

either treat ADHD and/or improve their academic performance. Other times, the belief that an 

expert should grant final approval was actually a safeguard against the instability of these assessments and the fact that students can potentially manipulate the results or work around the qualifying criteria. As a result, the doctors, disabilities services providers and even drug dealers in my study were able to justify denying students access to ADHD treatments and services if they did not feel as though the student would use it responsibly.

### **7.3  MORAL PHARMACEUTICAL OBJECTS**

I also mapped the fluid symbolic meaning of Adderall within specific transactions and 

across contexts. I presented ethnographic evidence to highlight the drug’s capacity, through the processes of pharmaceuticalization, to produce and mediate moral subjectivities. My intention 

206


---

###### Page 218

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_218_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_218_7.png)

was to uncover and explore the tensions between agency and dependency that Whyte et al. 

(2002) argue are inherent to many instances of pharmaceutical use. I conceptualize this tension 

as the shift between the flexibility and instability of Adderall’s symbolic meaning. I provided a 

limited genealogy of this flexibility in Chapter 2 and described how the cultural meaning of Adderall is directly shaped by shifting paradigms of medicalization and biomedicalization at the turn of the century. As definitions for Adult ADHD continued to evolve throughout the late 

2000s and early 2010s, it both expanded and obscured criteria for diagnosis. Moreover, it morphed ADHD into a simultaneously psychiatric, neurobiological, and behavioral problem, 

creating opportunities for new forms of expertise to become engaged with and emerge from these newly expanded/refined diagnostic categories.

My research showed how increasing the qualifiers that are placed around responsible 

drug use, the more ambiguous the definition becomes. I found that many of the students in my 

study used this ambiguity to their advantage by either identifying with ADHD (e.g. I probably 

have ADHD anyway) or using it to reject the category altogether (e.g. ADHD isn ’t real, so Adderall isn’t really a medication) in order to rationalize their illicit behaviors. Thus, it appears that the flexibility of stimulants is what gives users a sense of both moral agency and neoliberal 

agency to be able to access the drug and apply its power as needed. This flexibility is also what made Adderall a logical resolution to other moments of moral breakdown associated with college 

life. This includes dealing with the pressures of improving academic performance, paying for 

college, treating mental illness, preserving academic integrity, and maintaining social relationships.

At the same time, my informants rarely described Adderall as a magic bullet that could, without influence or consequence, solve their social or medical problems. For some, Adderall 

207


---

###### Page 219

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_219_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_219_7.png)

was a tool that could be used as part of a larger plan to increase mental health, cognitive function, and/or academic performance. For others, Adderall was a tool that came with social and medical side effects that needed to be strategically managed. This includes flexible criteria on who knows about the Adderall, who to give it to, where to get it from, how it is used, what it is used for, how much to give/take at once, etc. Yet, my study illustrates how students constantly adjusted these rules in order to constrain Adderall within their perceived moral boundaries of medication/enhancement/recreation. I articulate this as the movement from categorical flexibility, where users perceive control over the drug experience - to categorical instability, where users must adjust their behavior and definitions of responsible stimulant use to maintain a sense of moral agency over the drug experience.

### **7.4  MORAL PHARMACEUTICAL SUBJECTS**

A third contribution to the study of pharmaceutical morality made by this dissertation was in examining the various ways in which Adderall users interpreted their pharmaceutical experiences in relation to their moral subjectivities. In each data chapter of this dissertation, I analyzed how the participants in my study described what they believed to be the ideal moral consumer, patient, drug seeker and user. Each of these moral subjectivities represented a variable combination of social contexts, relationships, practices, and value systems. They also entailed a diverse set of moral considerations and breakdowns, each stemming from an increased availability of prescription stimulants in the college environment. My research illustrated how students relied on both neoliberal and moral logics to rationalize their desires to seek out, circulate and consume Adderall. However, these logics were not consistent and were often conflated to the point where it was difficult to tell whether their decisions were pre-mediated or 

208


---

###### Page 220

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_220_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_220_7.png)

rationalized after the fact. However, by combining interviews with participant observations, I was able to identify the congruencies and dissonances between how my informants described themselves during interviews—as healthy, empowered and responsible individuals—and their 

lived experiences as students, friends, patients, drug dealers and drug users.

One of the key findings from this study is that moral subjectivity was intimately linked to 

students’ ability to maintain agency over the drug experience by maximizing the benefit and/or minimizing the harms. This was a skill that could be developed overtime through supervised 

experimentation with a medical professional. In some cases, this meant working with a doctor who would be willing to explore treatment options which may or may not include Adderall. In 

other cases, this meant working with a doctor who would adjust or increase their dosage to make 

sure they were achieving the maximum desired effects of the drug.

Agency was also maintained by the students in my study through ongoing, unsupervised 

experimentation with the stimulants. This refers to the independent practice of consuming Adderall with or without a prescription, reflecting on the positive or negative experience, and 

adjusting accordingly. In many cases, these adjustments highlighted the range of conflicting moral logics students relied on to justify their pharmaceutical choices. For example, I found that 

some illicit Adderall users engaged in optimization strategies which included stockpiling and 

seeking out high dose pills. In some cases, these illicit users would decide to seek out a prescription in order to justify their illicit behaviors while at the same time, gaining regular 

access to the drug. I also found that some illicit Adderall users would engage in personalization 

strategies which included only consuming certain brands or dosages obtained from dealers they trusted. Some students rejected the suggestion that obtaining their own prescription or 

209

###### Page 221

![THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_221_7](Generated/images/THEMORALLIFEOFADDERALL_221_7.png)

discontinuing a previous prescription in favor of illicit use because it would limit their temptations to consume Adderall more often than needed.

It is important to note that these experiments were not always premeditated calculations, rather, they are a constant feedback loop of moral breakdowns that students use to inform their 

future pharmaceutical choices. As I mentioned earlier, some students claimed that they never really thought about their strategies before their participation in my research. When I asked them to explain their behaviors to me, it forced them to work through the potential moral concerns my 

questions triggered. Documenting how students responded to these questions during the 

interview and acted on them in day-to-day situations was key to understanding how students 

dealt with the double-edged nature of these drugs. As discussed, students in my study did not fit Abraham’s (2010) dichotomy of access-oriented versus injury-oriented drug consumers. Instead, 

I found that most students were either ambivalent or respectful about the power of Adderall. This 

approach allowed students to cope with the temptations of Adderall use without compromising their moral subjectivities.

### **7.5  TOWARDS AN ANTHROPOLOGY OF PHARMACEUTICAL MORALITY**

As prescription stimulants become an increasingly normalized yet controversial fixture in the college environment, it is important to contextualize the origins and implications of this trend 

across multiple domains and levels of pharmaceutical experience. This is because no single theory or account of pharmaceutical consumption is enough to understand the wide-reaching 

influence of these powerful cultural objects. As commodities, stimulants produce and mediate a range of economic relationships between consumers, political regulatory bodies, and multinational corporations. As treatments for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), 

210

they embody the healing power of biomedicine to transform impaired bodies into healthy, 

industrious citizens. As illicit substances, they carry implicit medical and social side effects 

including the potential for heart attacks, psychosis, addiction, and stigma. As cognitive 

enhancers, they stretch the imagination of what is possible to accomplish with the medically upgraded brain.

Like any prescription drug, Adderall is not inherently good or bad, yet its complex 

chemical and cultural functions have made it incredibly contentious, especially within the university setting. In this dissertation, I illustrated the flexible quality of prescription stimulants 

and how it can reflect and reshapes moral expectations and experiences of health, empowerment, 

and responsibility among U.S. college students. I accomplished this by tying together theories of pharmaceuticalization and morality and grounding these abstract concepts through authentic 

ethnographic accounts of Adderall use in multiple forms and across multiple contexts. I argue that when considered collectively, these moments contribute to a more thorough understanding 

of the ways in which pharmaceutical morality is challenged, negotiated and constructed across the social life of Adderall at American State University.
