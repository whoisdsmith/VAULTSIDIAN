Key Words: drug abuse • neurotoxicity • bcl gene family

Amphetamines and analogs  known  as  ‘Speed’, ‘Ice’,  ‘Eve’,  or  ‘Ecstasy’  (methylenedioxymetham­ phetamine,  or  MDMA)2  are mi sused as  psychostimu­ lants  and  have  become  popular  recreational  drugs  of abuse over the last decade. Users assume these drugs are  safe  because  they  believe  that  the  drugs  to  not produce  physical  dependence  and  damage.  How­ ever,  a  growing  number  of  deaths  after  MDMA intoxication  have  been  reported  recently  (1).  Main clinical  toxic  features  of  amphetamines  such  as  hy­ perthermia,  circulation,  and  hepatic  failure  correlate with  pathomorphological  demonstration  of  acute myocyte  and  hepatocyte  necrosis.  Amphetamines 

<sup>0892-6638/99/0013-1065/$02.25 © FASEB1065</sup>

have  also  been  associated  with  teratogenesis  and increased  fetal  and  infant  death  rates  related  to maternal  drug  abuse  comparable  to  the  effects  of cocaine (2, 3).

In  addition,  ‘Ecstasy’  and  other  amphetaminederived  drugs  induce  hallucinations  as  well  as  long­

term  neuropsychiatric  alterations  such  as  panic  dis­ orders,  psychosis,  and  affective  disorders  (4-6).  Very recently,  quantitative  positron  emission  tomographic evidence  (PET)  studies  provided  evidence  of  a  de­ crease  in  brain  5-HT  transporters  in  human  MDMA users, stron gly suggesting  toxic eff ects of  ‘Ecstasy’ in human  serotonergic  neurons  (7).  Indeed,  for  several years  experimental  data  had  demonstrated  neuro­

toxicity  to  neurons  of  laboratory  animals  and  non­ human  primates  (8-11).  So  far,  reports  of  the  neu­ rotoxic  effects  of  amphetamines  are  focused  to serotonergic  and  dopaminergic  neurons,  which  are located  mainly  in  midbrain  structures.  However, structural  neuronal  alterations  have  also  been  de­

tected  in  the  striatum  and  prefrontal  cortex  of amphetamine-treated  rats,  indicating  a  more  general 

toxic  process  (12,  13).  The  underlying  mechanisms of  action  in  amphetamine  neurotoxicity  are  still unknown,  although  there  is  some  evidence  for  hy­ droxyl  radical  formation  and  for  activation  of  apo­ ptotic pathways (14-18).

The  present  study  aimed  to  determine  whether amphetamines  deleteriously  affect  cortical  neurons and,  if  so,  which  cell  death-associated  pathways  are involved in the neurotoxic process.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Cell culture**

Primary  cultures  of  fetal  neurons  were  prepared  as  described previously  (19).  In  brief,  pregnant  Wistar  rats  were  killed  after halothane  narcosis  by  cervical  dislocation  and  fetuses  (E  18) were  removed  after  midline  incision.  Neocortical  regions were  microdissected  under  sterile  conditions  and  kept  on  ice in  preparation  medium  (Dulbecco’s  modified  Eagle’s  me­ dium  (DMEM)/25  mM  HEPES).  After  mechanical  dissocia­

tion  of  tissue,  cells  were  centrifuged,  resuspended  in  MEM 

(minimal  essential  medium)  supplemented  with  antibiotics 

(antibiotic/antimycotic  solution:  10,000  U  penicillin,  10,000 

pg  streptomycin,  25  pg  amphotericin  B/ml  in  saline),  1  mM pyruvate,  and  10%  heat-inactivated  fetal  calf  serum.  They were  then  plated  at  a  density  of  1.75  X  105  cells/well  in poly-D-lysine-coated  24-well  dishes.  After  24  h,  the  medium was  replaced  by  a  serum-free  medium  (START  V).  Cells  were maintained  at  37°C  and  5%  CO2  at  a  humidity  of  95-100% and  used  for  experiments  starting  at  day  11  of  cultivation in 

vitro.  Cell  culture  media  and  supplements  were  purchased from  Seromed  (Berlin,  Germany),  poly-D-lysine  from  Sigma 

(Deisenhofen,  Germany),  and  cell  culture  dishes  from  Nunc 

(Wiesbaden, Germany).

**Treatment with amphetamines**

Cortical  neurons  were  treated  with  125,  250,  500,  750,  and 

1000  pM  of  D-amphetamine  (DA),  methamphetamine  (MA), methylenedioxyamphetamine  (MDA),  and  MDMA  for  1,  24, and  96  h,  respectively.  All  amphetamines  were  supplied  by Sigma  (Munchen,  Germany);  stock  solutions  were  prepared in  phosphate-buffered  saline  and  further  diluted  in  medium under sterile conditions.

**Quantification of cell viability**

Cellular  morphology  was  photographically  documented  by phase  contrast  microscopy  after  1,  24,  and  96  h  of  amphet­ amine  treatment.  In  addition,  cell  viability  after  96  h  of exposure  to  amphetamines  was  quantified  by  a  modified  MTT 

[3-(4,5-dimethyl-tetrazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium  bro­ mide]  assay  (EZ4  U,  Biozol  GmbH,  Eching,  Germany).  After 

3.5  h  of  incubation  at  the  end  of  the  treatment  period, absorption  was  measured  at  490  nm  in  a  microplate  reader 

(Dynatech,  Denkendorf,  Germany).  A  620  nm  reference  filter was  used  to  correct  for  nonspecific  background  values.  Data of  the  MTT  assay  represent  results  of  four  independent experiments.  Differences  between  treatments  were  evaluated using Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance on ranks.

**Analysis of DNA fragmentation**

Isolation of genomic DNA and agarose gel electrophoresis

Genomic  DNA  was  extracted  from  cortical  neurons  treated with  500  pM  each  of  DA  and  MA  for  96  h,  as  follows.  Cells were  washed  in  phosphate-buffered  saline  and  rinsed  in homogenization  buffer  containing  10  mM  TrisCl  (pH  7),  10 mM  EDTA,  and  0.6%  sodium  dodecyl  sulfate.  After  30  min  of incubation  with  10  pg/ml  RNase  A  at  56°C,  NaCl  was  added to  an  end  concentration  of  1  M  and  the  mixture  was  incu­ bated  for  an  additional  2  h  at  4°C.  Protein  precipitations  were removed  by  20  min  of  centrifugation  at  4°C  and  20,000 g,  the supernatant  was  extracted  first  with  phenol-chloroformisoamyl  alcohol  (25:24:1)  and  then  with  chloroform-isoamyl 

alcohol  (24:1).  Precipitation  of  DNA  was  performed  with 

absolute  ethanol  overnight  at  —20°C  and  centrifugation  at 

20,000  gfor  20  min.  After  photometric  quantification,  5  pg  of 

each  DNA  sample  were  run  on  1.6%  agarose  gel  and  visual­

ized with ethidium bromide staining.

In situ biotinylation of DNA strand breaks and immunodetection

DNA  fragmentation  was  determined in  situ  after  96  h  of 

treatment  with  500  pM  of  amphetamines  and  in  control  cells. 

For  this  purpose,  we  used  the  FragEL  Klenow  Kit  from 

Calbiochem-Novabiochem  (Bad  Soden,  Germany)  according 

to  the  manufacturer’s  protocol.  In  brief,  DNA  strand  breaks 

within  the  nuclei  were  labeled  by  biotinylated  dNTPs  and 

Klenow  polymerase,  and  detected  with  a  peroxidase-coupled 

secondary  antibody.  Visualization  was  performed  by  3'-diami-

nobenzidine tetrahydrochloride.

**RNA extraction and detection of gene products by reverse** 

**transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)**

Total  mRNA  was  extracted  from  cultured  and  untreated  cells 

with  the  RNeasy  total  RNA  isolation  kit  (Quiagen,  Hilden, 

Germany).  cDNA  first-strand  synthesis  was  performed,  incu­

bating  250  ng  RNA  of  control  and  treated  cells  for  90  min  at 

37°C  in  a  20  pl  standard  RT  reaction  mix  containing  random 

hexamers  (6.25  A260  units/ml),  IX  RT  reaction  buffer,  10 

mM  DTT,  62.5  pM  dNTPs,  and  100  U  MMLV  reverse  tran­

scriptase  (Life  Technologies,  Eggenstein,  Germany).  First-

strand  cDNA  (2.5  pl)  was  used  as  template  for  subsequent 

PCR, applying primers (MWG, Ebersberg, Germany) for

PCR  mix  contained  1X  PCR  reaction  buffer,  1.5  mM  MgCl2, 

20  pM  dNTPs,  100  nM  primer,  and  0.5  U Taq  polymerase 

(Quiagen,  Hilden,  Germany).  PCR  products  were  separated  by 

electrophoresis  in  5%  nondenaturating  polyacrylamide  gels  and 

visualized  by si lver st aining as  described  previously (20) . Semi-

quantitative  analysis  was  assessed  by  using  the  NIH  Image 

analysis program on a Macintosh Power PC.

**RESULTS**

**Neurotoxicity of amphetamine analogs**

Microscopic  evaluation  and  photodocumentation  of 

the  amphetamine  effects  on  cortical  neurons  re­

vealed  no  morphological  differences  between  un­

treated  controls  and  amphetamine  exposed  cells 

after  the  first  hour.  The  first  neuritic  cell  damage 

became  visible  after  24  h  of  treatment.  The  neuro­

toxic effect was obvious within 96 h of incubation

**Figure  1.** Primary  rat  cortical  neurons  are  cultured in  vitro  for 

14  days  without  amphetamine  treatment  (A).  96  h  exposure to  500  pM  D-amphetamine  (day  11  to  14  of in  vitro  culturing) leads to neuritic damage and loss of viable neurons (B).

with  amphetamines,  as  shown  by  destroyed  neuronal dendrites  and  quantitative  reduction  of  viable  cells 

**(Fig.** 1).

This  morphological  effect  of  amphetamine  treat­ ment  was  underscored  by  quantification  of  neurotox­ icity  by  using  the  MTT  cell  viability  test.  After  an incubation  period  of  96  h,  we  observed  dose-depen­ dent  toxic  effects  for  all  four  compounds  compared with  untreated  cells **(Fig.** 2A-D).  Using  a  mean dosage  of  500  pM  of  amphetamines,  we  found  that all  four  amphetamine  compounds  induced  a  signif­ icant  decrease  in  cell  viability  compared  with  control 

(P<0.01  in  Kruskal-Wallis  one-way  analysis  of  vari­ ance  on  ranks).  The  nonmethylated  derivatives  DA and  MDA  showed  a  significantly  higher  neurotoxic­ ity  with  49.6%  ±  16.8  (DA)  and  43.3%  ±  7.0  (MDA) cell  viability  than  the  methylated  amphetamine  com­ pounds  MA  and  MDMA,  with  neuronal  survival  rates of  74.8%  ±  9.4  and  65.8%  ±  11.4,  respectively 

(P<0.01 in Kruskal Wallis) **(Fig. 3).**

**DNA fragmentation**

Genomic  DNA  extracted  from  untreated  cortical neurons  explanted  and  grown in  vitro  for  14  days 

<sup>AMPHETAMINE-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN CORTICAL NEURONS1067</sup>

showed  a  high  proportion  of  high  molecular  weight 

DNA  and  only  a  distinct  laddering  of  DNA  due  to 

endonucleosomal  cleavage  in  the  agarose  gel  elec­

trophoresis.  However,  after  96  h  treatment  with  500 

pM  of  DA  and  MA,  the  amount  of  apoptotically 

cleaved  DNA  dramatically  increased  and  the  typical 

DNA laddering phenomenon was present **(Fig. 4).**

Using  the  FragEL  DNA  fragmentation  assay,  we 

observed  only  3-5%  positive  nuclei  in  the  untreated 

control  cells.  However,  after  96  h  of  500  pM  MA  and 

DA  treatment,  prominent  immunoreactivity  and  nu­

clear  fragmentation  were  present  in  approximately 

40% (MA)-70% (DA) of cells **(Fig. 5).**

**Alteration of gene expression**

Analysis  of  gene  expression  was  performed  after 

treatment  with  500  pM  of  amphetamines  DA,  MDA, 

MA, and MDMA for 1, 24, and 96 h, respectively.

Using  RT-PCR,  we  observed  distinct  differential 

expression  patterns  of  the  bcl-xL  (long)  and  bcl-xs 

(short)  isoforms  during  amphetamine  treatment 

**(Fig.  6A).** Bcl-xL  was  down-regulated  by  all  four 

amphetamine  compounds  after  96  h  of  incubation. 

In  contrast,  the  bcl-xs  isoform  was  induced  by  am­

phetamine  treatment.  Induction  was  observed  as 

soon  as  1  h  after  treatment  with  MA  and  MDMA  and 

after  incubation  for  96  h  with  the  nonmethylated 

compounds  DA  and  MDA.  Although  up-regulation 

of  the  bcl-xs  splice  variant  was  delayed  in  DA  and 

MDA  treatment,  the  intensity  of  induction  after  96  h 

treatment  was  as  prominent  as  for  MA  and  MDMA. 

No  significant  transcriptional  regulation  was  ob­

served  for  bax  and bcl-2  mRNA w hen compared  with 

the  expression  of  the  housekeeping  gene  [3-actin 

(Fig- 6B).

750,  and  1000  pM  for  a  treatment  period  of  96  h.  MTT  cell 

viability  tests  demonstrate  dose-dependent  toxic  effects  for  all

**Figure  6.** RT-PCR  from  RNA  of  control  and  amphetamine-treated  cortical  neurons  shows  differential  regulation  of  the  bcl-x splice  variants  with  induction  of  the  short  bcl-xs  transcript  and  reduced  transcription  of  the  long  bcl-xL  variant.  (A).  No regulation of bcl-2 or bax expression was observed in comparison to [i-actin (B).

The  immediate  early  gene  c-jun  and  the  inhibitor of  translation  initiation  p97  were  up-regulated  by both  DA  and  MDA.  Whereas  a  2.5-fold  induction  of p97 mRNA  was observed  transiently after  1 h  of drug treatment  (Fig.  7.8),  cjun  showed  a  prolonged  four­ fold  induction,  with  a  peak  at  24  h  of  treatment  (Fig. 7/1).  The  methylated  amphetamine  analogs  MA  and MDMA  did  not  significantly  influence  cjun  or  p97 transcription.  No  significant  changes  in  c-fos  mRNA levels  were observed  in an y of the  experiments (data not shown).  RT-PCR results  were confirmed  by semiquantitative  analysis  using  the  NIH  Image  analysis program (Fig. 6/1, Fig. 7/1, B).

### **DISCUSSION**

The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  determine whether  popular  amphetamine  drugs  of  abuse  are able  to  direcdy  damage  rat  cortical  neurons in  vitro. The role of cell stress- and apoptosis-associated path­

ways  in  amphetamine  neurotoxicity  was  also  investi­ gated.  We  were  able  to  demonstrate  that  subchronic exposure  to  either  DA  (‘Speed’),  MA  (‘Ice’),  MDA, or  MDMA  (‘Ecstasy’)  leads  to  significant  neurotoxic­ ity  in  rat  neocortical  neurons.  Amphetamine-in­ duced  neuronal  cell  death  was  accompanied  by endonucleosomal  DNA  cleavage  and  nuclear  break­ down  as  well  as  differential  expression  of  the  antiand  proapoptotic  bcl-xL/s  splice  variants,  indicating an  involvement  of  apoptotic  pathways  in  amphet­ amine neurotoxicity.

Amphetamines are  widely misused  as psychostimulatory  and  hallucinatory  agents.  The  analogs  MDA and  MDMA  as  main  compounds  of  the  designer drug  ‘Ecstasy’  became  appallingly  prominent  as  rec­ reational  drugs  of  abuse  during  the  last  decade. Postmortem  findings  in  accumulating  human  deaths associated with  ‘Ecstasy’ intoxication  resemble hepa­

tocyte and myocyte  necrosis as well  as brain perivas­ cular  hemorrhagic  and  hypoxic  changes  (1).  Mc­

Cann and co-workers were able to demonstrate a

decrease  in  brain  5-HT  transporters  in  abstinent human  MDMA  users  by  quantitative  PET  studies  (7). Their  data  strongly  suggest  that  ‘Ecstasy’  leads  to long-lasting  toxic  effects  in  human  serotonin  neu­ rons. For  a  decade,  animal  experiments  have  provided evidence  that  certain  amphetamine  analogs  have  the potential  to  directiy  damage  central  monoaminergic neurons.  It  has  been  shown  in  nonhuman  primates and rodents  that DA  is toxic to  dopaminergic neurons, MDMA  to  serotonergic  neurons,  and  MA  to  both  (8, 9).  This  neurotoxic  effect  and  the  amphetamine-in­ duced behavioral syndrome are associated with a mas­ sive  and  rapid  depletion  of  serotonin  and  dopamine

storages by enhanced release and blocked reuptake of neurotransmitters  (21).  The  underlying  mechanism for neuronal cell  damage is still  unknown, but involve­ ment of oxygen-based  free radicals in th e mediation of toxicity has been suggested by several authors (16-18, 22, 23).  The attenuation  of MA  neurotoxicity in  CuZnsuperoxide  dismutase  transgenic  mice  and  pretreat­ ment with  ascorbic acid  supported the  hypothesis that endogenous  formation  of  6-hydroxydopaminee  and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine  might  be  responsible  for  the toxic  effects.  In  this  context,  activation  of  apoptotic pathways  by  amphetamine  intoxication  has  recendy been discussed. Cadet et al. (14, 24) demonstrated that MA  neurotoxicity  in  rat  neural  cells  is  preventable  by

overexpression  of  antiapoptotic  bcl-2  protein  and  ho­ mozygous  knockout  of  p53.  Evidence  for  amphet­ amine-induced apoptosis has also come from Simantov and Tauber (15), who  showed cell cycle arrest  in G2M phase  and  DNA  laddering  in  the  human  placental serotonergic cell line  JAR after 48  h of MDMA  and DA 

treatment.

Whereas  earlier  investigations  have  mainly  been restricted  to  serotonergic  and  dopaminergic  neu­ rons,  the  present  study  focused  on  amphetamine neurotoxicity  in  rat  cortical  neurons.  Induction  of endonucleosomal  DNA  cleavage  demonstrated  by DNA  laddering  in  the  gel  electrophoresis  and in  situ detection  accompanies  significant  loss  of  cell  viability in  the  primary  cortical  cell  cultures.  Furthermore,  we were  able  to  show  differential  expression  of  the bcl-xL/s  gene  during  amphetamine  treatment.  The protective  long-splice  variant  bcl-xL,  was  down-regu­ lated  by  amphetamines,  whereas  the  contrary  effect was  observed  for  the  proapoptotic  bcl-xs  isoform, which  was  up-regulated  during  the  progress  of  neu­ ronal cell  damage. In  contrast, bax  and bcl-2  expres­ sion  were  not  affected  by  amphetamine  treatment. These  data a re  in  accordance  with t he observation  of Parasadanian  et  al.  (25),  who  emphasized  the  role  of bcl-xL  as  an  antiapoptotic  regulator,  especially  for mature  central  neurons.  They  demonstrate t hat  over­ expression  of  bcl-xL  in  transgenic  mice  prevents apoptosis  of  cortical  and  hippocampal  neurons  in  a hypoxia-ischemia  paradigm.  However,  a  complete lack  of  bcl-xL  expression  in  knockout  mice  leads  to extensive  apoptotic  neuronal  cell  death  and  lethality at  embryonal  day  13,  underscoring  the  crucial  role  of bcl-xL  in  the  survival  of  postmitotic  neurons  (26). Therefore,  the  drug-dependent  regulation  of  the bcl-xL/s  variants  observed  during  the  progress  of amphetamine  neurotoxicity  might  be  an  important step  in  the  induction  of  amphetamine-induced  apo­ ptosis of rat cortical neurons in vitro.

Regulation  of  pro-  and  antiapoptotic  genes  is  well characterized  in  the  hypoxia-ischemia  paradigm and  occurs  simultaneously  with  changes  in  the  ex­ pression  pattern  of  the  immediate  early  genes  (27, 

28).  However,  a  direct  functional  connection  be­

tween  these  gene  families  has  not  yet  been  estab­ lished.  Expression  of  eJun  can  be  associated  with both  cell  proliferation  and  cell  death,  depending  on cofactors  such  as  c-fos  expression  (29,  30).  In  isch­ emic  neuronal  cell  damage,  induction  of  eJun  with­ out  coexpression  of  its  AP-1  partner  c-fos  and  inhi­ bition  of  protein  synthesis  initiation  are  the  most predictive  markers  for  delayed  neuronal  death.  In 

the  present  study  we  observed a prolonged  induction of  e  Jun  transcription  after  24-96  h  of  treatment  with 

the  highly  toxic  DA  and  its  ring  substitute  MDA.  The methylated  and  less  toxic  MA  and  MDMA  analogs, however,  did  not  significandy  alter  the  eJun  RNA 

<sup>AMPHETAMINE-INDUCED APOPTOSIS IN CORTICAL NEURONS1071</sup>

level. A  c-fos induction  was not  present after  either of 

the  amphetamine  treatments.  These  findings  were 

underscored  by  the  differential  induction  of  p97 

after  amphetamine  treatment.  p97  inhibits  initiation 

of  protein  biosynthesis  as  a  competitive  homologue 

of  the  initiation  factor  E4F  (31).  Similar  to  eJun,  a 

transient  up-regulation  of  p97  after  1  h  treatment  is 

also  induced  only  by  DA  and  MDA,  but  not  by  MA  or 

### MDMA.

In  conclusion,  our  investigation  demonstrates  am­

phetamine-induced  neurotoxicity  in  cortical  neu­

rons  accompanied  by  apoptotic  DNA  fragmentation. 

Furthermore,  we  were  able  to  associate  amphet­

amine-induced  differential  regulation  of  the  bcl-xL/s 

splice  variants  with  neuronal  cell  death.  Down-regu­

lation  of  the  protective  bcl-xL  and  simultaneous 

induction  of  the  proapoptotic  bcl-xs  variant  accom­

pany  the  neurotoxic  effect.  Expression  of  the  imme­

diate  early  transcription  factor  eJun  and  the  transla­

tion  initiation  inhibitor  p97  are  restricted  to  the 

nonmethylated  DA  and  MDA  analogs  and  thereby  to 

high neurotoxic potential.  [D]
