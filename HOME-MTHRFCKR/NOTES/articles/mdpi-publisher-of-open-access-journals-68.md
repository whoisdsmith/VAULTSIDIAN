Self-paced learning (SPL) is a learning mechanism inspired by human and animal learning processes that gives variable weights to samples, gradually introducing simple to more complicated samples into the learning set as the “age” parameter increases. To regulate the learning process, a self-paced weighting regularization term with an “age” parameter is introduced to the learning function. Several self-paced weighting methods have been proposed, and different regularization terms might result in varied learning performance. However, on the one hand, it is difficult to select a suitable weighting method for SPL. On the other hand, it is challenging to determine the “age” parameter, and it is easy for SPL to obtain poor results as the “age” of the model increases. To solve the aforementioned difficulties, an ensemble SPL approach with an adaptive mixture weighting mechanism is proposed in this study. First, as the “age” parameter increases, a set of base classifiers is collected to produce a new data set, which is used to learn the second-level classifier. Then, the ensemble model is used to generate the final output to avoid the selection of the optimal “age” parameter. An adaptive mixture weighting method is designed to reduce the dependence of parameters on human experience. The previous methods find it difficult to determine the “age” parameters or self-paced parameters. In this paper, these parameters can be adjusted adaptively during the learning process. In comparison with the previous SPL techniques, the proposed method achieves the best results in 27 of the 32 datasets in the experiments with the adaptive parameters. The statistical tests are carried out to show that the proposed method is superior to other state-of-the-art algorithms. [Full article](/2079-9292/11/19/3154)

Children with Down syndrome (DS) are at risk for challenges with aspects of executive function (EF). The current study explores whether heterogeneity in EF profiles can be detected within a sample of children with DS. Participants were 69 children with DS, ages 3–10 years (M = 6.23, SD = 1.91). T-scores from a caregiver-report measure of executive function were modeled using latent profile analysis, and auxiliary analyses examined the association between demographic and biomedical factors and probability of profile membership. The two-profile solution was the best fit for the sample, with a profile that involved elevated scores in working memory only (“Working Memory Only” profile; 43% of sample) and a “Multi-Domain” profile that involved elevated scores in planning, inhibition, and working memory (57%). The presence of congenital heart defects was associated with a higher probability of assignment to the Multi-Domain profile. Findings from this study contribute to the characterization of heterogeneous outcomes associated with DS. [Full article](/2076-3425/12/10/1333)

Vascular risk factors may predispose to post-stroke delirium (PSD). A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. The primary outcome was the prevalence of vascular risk factors in PSD vs. non-PSD patients. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Fixed effects or random effects models were used in case of low- or high-statistical heterogeneity, respectively. We found an increased prevalence of atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.74, _p_ = 0.0004), prior stroke (OR = 1.48, _p_ < 0.00001), coronary artery disease (OR = 1.48, _p_ < 0.00001), heart failure (OR = 2.01, _p_ < 0.0001), and peripheral vascular disease (OR = 2.03, _p_ < 0.00001) in patients with vs. without PSD. PSD patients were older (MD = 5.27 y, _p_ < 0.00001) compared with their non-PSD counterparts. Advanced age, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease appeared to be significantly associated with PSD.

This paper reports on the most ancient unusual morphological trait of the apertures of Poaceae pollen found in archaeological layers. In Poaceae, high levels of hybridization, polyploidy, apomixis, and multiporate pollen are often related. Multiple genomes in polyploids are critical for the adaptation of plant species to stresses and could be revealed by anomalies in pollen development. Therefore, the paleoenvironmental research can gain great benefits from identifying polyploids in past contexts by observing anomalous pollen morphology during pollen counts. The occurrence of multiporate pollen in Poaceae has also been related to special features of the ecology of the species showing this anomaly, as well as to climatic and environmental stresses experienced by Poaceae living in a given region. Multiporate and bi- or tri-porate instead of monoporate pollen grains have been observed in samples taken from Takarkori rockshelter, an archaeological site in southwestern Libya (central Sahara) that has been occupied between ~10,200 and ~4650 cal BP. Multiporate pollen was found in organic sands and coprolites of ovicaprines. On the basis of archaeobotanical research, this work aims to investigate whether the presence of supernumerary pores in Poaceae pollen may be an effect of both climatic/hydrological changes and continued anthropogenic pressure on the wild grasses living in the region. The presence of multiporate pollen reveals that Poaceae that lived in central Sahara tackled several kinds of stress during the early and middle Holocene. The Takarkori pollen record suggests that climate change could have played a major role in the early Holocene, while human pressure became stronger during the middle Holocene. The change in environmental conditions determined adaptive responses of polyploid grasses even in the form of multiporate pollen. [Full article](/2571-550X/5/4/41)

Let _R_ be a Galois ring, GR(pn,r), of characteristic pn and of order pnr. In this article, we study cyclic codes of arbitrary length, _N_, over _R_. We use discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to determine a unique representation of cyclic codes of length, _N_, in terms of that of length, ps, where s=vp(N) and vp are the p-adic valuation. As a result, Hamming distance and dual codes are obtained. In addition, we compute the exact number of distinct cyclic codes over _R_ when n=2. [Full article](/2075-1680/11/10/519)

Initial screening of criminal evidence often involves serological testing of stains of unknown composition and/or origin discovered at a crime scene to determine the tissue of origin. This testing is presumptive but critical for contextualizing the scene. Here, we describe a microfluidic approach for body fluid profiling via fluorescent electrophoretic separation of a published mRNA panel that provides unparalleled specificity and sensitivity. This centrifugal microfluidic approach expedites and automates the electrophoresis process by allowing for simple, rotationally driven flow and polymer loading through a 5 cm separation channel; with each disc containing three identical domains, multi-sample analysis is possible with a single disc and multi-sample detection per disc. The centrifugal platform enables a series of sequential unit operations (metering, mixing, aliquoting, heating, storage) to execute automated electrophoretic separation. Results show on-disc fluorescent detection and sizing of amplicons to perform comparably with a commercial ‘gold standard’ benchtop instrument and permitted sensitive, empirical discrimination between five distinct body fluids in less than 10 min. Notably, our microfluidic platform represents a faster, simpler method for separation of a transcriptomic panel to be used for forensically relevant body fluid identification.

This article discusses how the pattern of elastic scattering of an electron on a pair of identical atomic centers is modified if we abandon the assumption, standard in molecular physics, that outside of some molecular sphere surrounding the centers, the wave function of the molecular continuum is atomic-like, being a linear combination of the regular and irregular solutions of the wave equation. For this purpose, the elastic scattering of slow particles by a pair of non- overlapping short-range potentials has been studied. The continuum wave function of the particle is represented as a combination of a plane wave and two spherical s-waves propagating freely throughout space. The asymptotic behavior of this function determines the amplitude of elastic particle scattering in closed form. It is demonstrated that this amplitude can be represented as a partial expansion in a set of the orthonormal functions Zλ(r) other than spherical harmonics Ylm(r). General formulas for these functions are obtained. The coefficients of the scattering amplitude expansion into a series of functions Zλ(r) and determine the scattering phases ηλ(k) for the considered two- atomic target. The special features of the S-matrix method for the case of arbitrary non-spherical potentials are discussed. [Full article](/2218-2004/10/4/105)

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has the highest mortality rates worldwide, yet effective treatment remains unavailable. TBI causes inflammatory responses, endoplasmic reticulum stress, disruption of the blood–brain barrier and neurodegeneration that lead to loss of cognition, memory and motor skills. Saffron (_Crocus sativus_ L.) is known for its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects, which makes it a potential candidate for TBI treatment. Zebrafish (_Danio rerio_) shares a high degree of genetic homology and cell signaling pathways with mammals. Its active neuro-regenerative function makes it an excellent model organism for TBI therapeutic drug identification. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of saffron administration to a TBI zebrafish model by investigating behavioral outcomes such as anxiety, fear and memory skills using a series of behavioral tests. Saffron exhibited anxiolytic effect on anxiety-like behaviors, and showed prevention of fear inhibition observed after TBI. It improved learning and enhanced memory performance. These results suggest that saffron could be a novel therapeutic enhancer for neural repair and regeneration of networks post-TBI. [Full article](/1422-0067/23/19/11600)

Current market trends point at increasing demand for functional foods, namely those carrying probiotics. In the case of table olives, presence of probiotics would convey a competitive advantage to Mediterranean-based diets, already established for their cultural heritage and gastronomic character. This work assessed the safety and resistance to gastrointestinal digestion of 19 native LAB strains from _Cobrançosa_ table olives. Strains were identified via molecular sequencing (4 fingerprints/10 strains for _Lactiplantibacillus_ _pentosus_, and 2 fingerprints/9 strains for _L. paraplantarum_), and exposed to simulated gastrointestinal fluids, as per the INFOGEST in vitro protocol with modifications. None of those strains proved dangerous for human consumption. Survivability to the gastrointestinal resistance test ranged from 29% to 70%, with strain-dependent variability. _L. paraplantarum_ i18, i27, and i102, and _L. pentosus_ i10 and i11 exhibited statistically lower survival rates (29–35%) than probiotic the Greek table olive reference strain _L_. _pentosus_ B281 (53%). Among the other strains, _L. paraplantarum_ i101 and _L. pentosus_ i53 and i106 showed the highest survival rates but were not significantly different from the strain of _Lacticaseibacillus casei_ isolated from commercial probiotic yoghurt (65–70%). In vitro results proved that strains retrieved from fermenting cultivar _Cobrançosa_ possess the potential to be claimed as probiotics—thus deserving further attention toward the development of a specific starter culture.

Soil structure is an important key in the bioremediation process; for instance, clay soils tend to have high absorption of pollutants and low rates of bioremediation due to their high plasticity and oxygen restrictions. This work assesses seven different treatments for contaminated clay soil using lime, silica nanoparticles, and both components in combination. After a three-month treatment, the variation of the soil granulometry, pH, porosity, cation exchange capacity (CEC), humidity, organic matter, respirometry, and humic acids were measured in order to evaluate the improvements regarding soil structure. Furthermore, total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals were monitored before and after the treatments. The combined treatment using lime and nanosilica presented the best results, reducing the percentage of clays from 61% to 5% and showing a relationship between improved of soil structure and the reduction of pollutants, with a 35% removal for TPHs being the highest obtained with the seven treatments.

Bioethanol to butadiene is currently the most promising non-oil-based butadiene production route. Here, copper is introduced into the conventional bimetallic zeolite catalyst to partially substitute for zinc; the isolated tetracoordinated Cu(II) species are formed, with weak and strong basic sites transformed into medium acid sites in trimetallic CuZnY/SiBEA catalyst. A partial substitution of zinc by copper increases the dispersion of metal, reduces the formation of ZnO clusters, decreases the pore blockage, and enhances the total pore volume of catalyst. The Cu1Zn2Y5/SiBEA catalyst with an appropriate 0.33 Cu/(Cu + Zn) mass ratio, a highest medium acid sites/(weak + strong) basic sites value of 6.17, and largest total pore volume of 0.251 cm3/g in all samples presents excellent catalytic performance in the ethanol to butadiene reaction: 99.01% ethanol conversion and 73.36% butadiene selectivity, higher than most reported ethanol to butadiene catalysts. The isolated tetracoordinated Cu(II) structure is stable, which is beneficial to the stability of trimetallic catalyst; when the reaction time is 60 h, the butadiene selectivity is 45.95%, 14% higher than corresponding bimetallic catalyst. The butadiene productivity of Cu1Zn2Y5/SiBEA catalyst reaches up to 1.68 gBD·gcat−1·h−1 at WHSV = 6 h−1 and time-on-stream = 8 h. Increasing reaction temperature could linearly increase the ethanol conversion, while the butadiene selectivity increases first and then decreases, the suitable temperature is 375 ℃ for the highest butadiene yield.

Anthropogenic activities and natural climate changes are the central driving forces of global ecosystems and agriculture changes. Climate changes, such as rainfall and temperature changes, have had the greatest impact on different types of plant production around the world. In the present study, we investigated the spatiotemporal variation of major crops (cotton, rice, wheat, and sugarcane) in the District Vehari, Pakistan, from 1984 to 2020 using remote sensing (RS) technology. The crop identification was pre-processed in ArcGIS software based on Landsat images. After pre-processing, supervised classification was used, which explains the maximum likelihood classification (MLC) to identify the vegetation changes. Our results showed that in the study area cultivated areas under wheat and cotton decreased by almost 5.4% and 9.1% from 1984 to 2020, respectively. Vegetated areas have maximum values of NDVI (> 0.4), and built-up areas showed fewer NDVI values (0 to 0.2) in the District Vehari. During the Rabi season, the temperature was increased from 19.93 °C to 21.17 °C. The average temperature was calculated at 34.28 °C to 35.54 °C during the Kharif season in the District Vehari. Our results showed that temperature negatively affects sugarcane, rice, and cotton crops during the Rabi season, and precipitation positively affects sugarcane, rice, and cotton crops during the Kharif season in the study area. Accurate and timely assessment of crop estimation and relation to climate change can give very useful information for decision-makers, governments, and planners in formulating policies regarding crop management and improving agriculture yields.

The overwhelming acceptance and growing need for Internet of Things (IoT) products in each aspect of everyday living is creating a promising prospect for the involvement of humans, data, and procedures. The vast areas create opportunities from home to industry to make an automated lifecycle. Human life is involved in enormous applications such as intelligent transportation, intelligent healthcare, smart grid, smart city, etc. A thriving surface is created that can affect society, the economy, the environment, politics, and health through diverse security threats. Generally, IoT devices are susceptible to security breaches, and the development of industrial systems could pose devastating security vulnerabilities. To build a reliable security shield, the challenges encountered must be embraced. Therefore, this survey paper is primarily aimed to assist researchers by classifying attacks/vulnerabilities based on objects. The method of attacks and relevant countermeasures are provided for each kind of attack in this work. Case studies of the most important applications of the IoT are highlighted concerning security solutions. The survey of security solutions is not limited to traditional secret key-based cryptographic solutions, moreover physical unclonable functions (PUF)-based solutions and blockchain are illustrated. The pros and cons of each security solution are also discussed here. Furthermore, challenges and recommendations are presented in this work. [Full article](/1424-8220/22/19/7433)

Climate warming can affect freeze–thaw cycle (FTCs) patterns in northern high-latitude regions and may affect permafrost carbon emissions. The response of carbon release and microbial communities to FTCs has not been well characterized. Here, we conducted laboratory incubation experiments to investigate the relationships among carbon emissions, bacterial community, and soil variables in a permafrost-affected forest–wetland ecotone in Northeast China. The emission rates of CO2 and CH4 increased during the FTCs. FTC amplitude, FTC frequency, and patch type had significant effects on carbon emissions. FTCs increased the contents of soil DOC, NH4+-N, and NO3--N but reduced bacterial alpha diversity. CO2 emissions were mainly affected by bacterial alpha diversity and composition, and the inorganic nitrogen content was the important factor affecting CH4 emissions. Our findings indicated that FTCs could significantly regulate CO2 and CH4 emissions by reducing bacterial community diversity and increasing the concentration of available soil substrates. Our findings shed new light on the microorganism-substrate mechanisms regulating the response patterns of the soil carbon cycle to FTCs in permafrost regions. [Full article](/2076-2607/10/10/1950)

Analog optical computing (AOC) has attracted great attention over the past few years, because of its ultra-high speed (potential for real-time processing), ultra-low power consumption, and parallel processing capabilities. In this article, we design an adder and an ordinary differential equation solver (ODE) on chip by Fourier optics and metasurface techniques. The device uses the 4f system consisting of two metalenses on both sides and one middle metasurface (MMS) as the basic structure. The MMS that performs the computing is the core of the device and can be designed for different applications, i.e., the adder and ODE solver in this article. For the adder, through the comparison of the two input and output signals, the effect of the addition can be clearly displayed. For the ODE solver, as a proof-of-concept demonstration, a representative optical signal is well integrated into the desired output distribution. The simulation result fits well with the theoretical expectation, and the similarity coefficient is 98.28%. This solution has the potential to realize more complex and high-speed artificial intelligence computing. Meanwhile, based on the direct-binary-search (DBS) algorithm, we design a signal generator that can achieve power splitting with the phase difference of π between the two output waveguides. The signal generator with the insertion loss of −1.43 dB has an ultra-compact footprint of 3.6 μm× 3.6 μm. It can generate a kind of input signal for experimental verification to replace the hundreds of micrometers of signal generator composed of a multi-mode interference (MMI) combination used in the verification of this type of device in the past.

The quest for novel nanoscale materials for different applications necessitates that they are easy to obtain and have excellent physical properties and low toxicity. Moreover, considering the ongoing environmental impact of noxious chemical waste products, it is important to adopt eco-friendly approaches for nanoparticle synthesis. In this work, a natural polymer (medium molecular weight chitosan) derived from chitin was employed as a reducing agent to obtain gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with a chitosan shell ([[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)) by a microwave oven. The chitosan is economically viable and cost-competitive in the market showing also nontoxic behavior in the environment and living organisms. The synthesized [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) NPs were fully characterized by spectroscopic and microscopic characterization techniques. The size distribution of NPs was about 15 nm, which is a suitable dimension to use in biomedical applications due to their high tissue penetration, great circulation in blood, and optimal clearance as well as low toxicity. The prepared polymer-capped NPs were further functionalized with a fluorescent molecule, i.e., Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC), to perform imaging in the cell. The results highlighted the goodness of the synthesis procedure, as well as the high internalization rate that resulted in an optimal fluorescence intensity. Thus, this work presents a good sustainable/green approach-mediated polymer nanocomposite for various applications in the field of diagnostic imaging. [Full article](/2571-8797/4/4/58)

Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic disease, but feline leptospirosis is rarely reported. This study aimed at investigating _Leptospira_ spp. prevalence in cats from southern Italy, evaluating risk factors, clinical findings and laboratory data associated with infection. The serum of 112 cats was investigated by microscopic agglutination test (MAT), detecting anti-_Leptospira_ antibodies against 14 pathogenic serovars. Blood and urine samples were tested by a real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the _lipL32_ gene of pathogenic _Leptospira_. Antibodies against serovars Poi, Bratislava, Arborea, Ballum, Pomona and Lora were detected in 15.3% (17/111) of cats (titers range: 20–320). _Leptospira_ spp. DNA was found in 3% (4/109) of blood and 9% (10/111) of urine samples. The spring season was the only risk factor for urinary _Leptospira_ DNA shedding. Laboratory abnormalities significantly associated and/or correlated with _Leptospira_ spp. positivity were anemia, monocytosis, neutrophilia, eosinopenia, increased alanine aminotransferase activity, hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia. In the investigated areas, cats are frequently infected by _Leptospira_ spp. and can represent an additional reservoir or sentinel for a risk of infection. Moreover, some laboratory changes could be compatible with a pathogenic effect of _Leptospira_ spp. in the feline host. [Full article](/2076-0817/11/10/1129)

Drinking water contamination by arsenic (As) is of significant concern due to its potential cause of cancer and arsenicosis. In this study, out of the 200 samples (_n_ = 200), the mean As concentrations ranged from below detection limit (BDL) to 3.30, 4.81, 4.42 and 3.85 µg L−1 in small residential, roadside, industrial and household areas, respectively. From 200 total samples, 9% of the groundwater samples showed As levels higher than the WHO safe guideline limit of 10 μg L−1. Human health risk was assessed using average daily intake (ADD), hazard quotient (HQ) and cancer risk (CR) values which were found to be greater than the recommended values by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (1.0 and 10−6) for health risk assessment. The CR were ranged from 0–5.7 × 10−1, 4.0 × 10−1, 2.0 × 10−1 and 1.0 × 10−1 in small residential areas for children, adolescents, males and females, respectively. In roadside areas, the values ranged from 0–2.8 × 10−1, 4.0 × 10−1, 2.0 × 10−1 and 2.8 × 10−1 for children, adolescents, males and females, while 0–5.9 × 10−1, 4.1 × 10−1, 2.1 × 10−1 and 1.6 × 10−1 in industrial areas and 0–8.0 × 10−1, 2.91 × 10−1, 2.6 × 10−1 and 3.9 × 10−1 were calculated in household sites. All the CR values were found to be exceeding the US-EPA limit (10−6) recommending that the people in the study area are more prone to carcinogenic risk. Overall, it was concluded that due to presence of As in drinking water, these areas tend to be at higher cancer risks. To provide safe drinking water for the people living in these As-affected areas, urgent remedial and management steps are required. [Full article](/2071-1050/14/19/12460)

The features of Patellar-Tendinopathy are (1): pain localised to the inferior pole of the patellar; (2): the presence of load-related pain. Body-Weight and Body-Mass-Index, as two easily-measured variables, could potentially aid the prediction of PT. This review aims to establish relationships between Body-Weight and Body-Mass-Index and Patellar-Tendinopathy via synthesising the evidence from prospective-cohort and cross-sectional studies in elite basketball and volleyball players. Seven databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Health-Management-Information-Consortium, National-Technical-Information-Service, ClinicalTrial.gov) and citation chasing were used to identify English peer-review articles from 2000 to 2022. An adapted version of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for critical appraisal. Two reviewers were involved in literature searching, data extraction, and quality review. Two prospective cohort and five cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria, providing 849 subjects (male:female: 436:413). Five studies found BW is associated with PT. Three studies found a relationship between BMI and PT. Six out of seven studies were classified as very good studies. All studies were level IV evidence. The very low certainty evidence suggests an association between BW and PT. There is moderate certainty evidence that BMI is associated with PT. These preliminary findings should be treated cautiously due to the lack of strong evidence. [Full article](/2227-9032/10/10/1928)

Based on the generalized Routh–Hurwitz criterion, we propose a sufficient and necessary criterion for testing the stability of fractional-order linear systems with order α∈1,2, called the fractional-order Routh–Hurwitz criterion. Compared with the existing criterion, ours involves fewer and simpler expressions, which is significant for analyzing the robust stability of high-dimensional uncertain systems. All these expressions are explicit ones about the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the system matrix, so the stable parameter region of fractional-order systems can be described directly. Some examples show the effectiveness of our method. [Full article](/2504-3110/6/10/557)

Sheeppox (SPP), goatpox (GTP), and lumpy skin disease (LSD) are economically significant pox diseases of ruminants, caused by sheeppox virus (SPPV), goatpox virus (GTPV), and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), respectively. SPPV and GTPV can infect both sheep and goats, while LSDV mainly affects cattle. The recent emergence of LSD in Asia and Europe and the repeated incursions of SPP in Greece, Bulgaria, and Russia highlight how these diseases can spread outside their endemic regions, stressing the urgent need to develop high-throughput serological surveillance tools. We expressed and tested two recombinant truncated proteins, the capripoxvirus homologs of the vaccinia virus C-type lectin-like protein A34 and the EEV glycoprotein A36, as antigens for an indirect ELISA (iELISA) to detect anti-capripoxvirus antibodies. Since A34 outperformed A36 by showing no cross-reactivity to anti-parapoxvirus antibodies, we optimized an A34 iELISA using two different working conditions, one for LSD in cattle and one for SPP/GTP in sheep and goats. Both displayed sound sensitivities and specificities: 98.81% and 98.72%, respectively, for the LSD iELISA, and 97.68% and 95.35%, respectively, for the SPP/GTP iELISA, and did not cross-react with anti-parapoxvirus antibodies of cattle, sheep, and goats. These assays could facilitate the implementation of capripox control programs through serosurveillance and the screening of animals for trade. [Full article](/2076-2607/10/10/1956)

This study aimed to detect and identify microorganisms in ticks collected in the Western Highlands of Cameroon. Quantitative real-time and standard PCR assays, coupled with sequencing, were used. A total of 944 ticks collected from cattle in five distinct sites in Cameroon were selected for the analyses. They belonged to five genera (_Amblyomma_, _Hyalomma_, _Rhipicephalus_, _Haemaphysalis,_ and _Ixodes_) and twelve species. Real-time PCR revealed that 23% (_n_ = 218) of the ticks were positive for _Rickettsia_ spp., 15% (_n_ = 141) for bacteria of the Anaplasmataceae family, 3% (_n_ = 29) for Piroplasmida, 0.5% (_n_ = 5) for _Coxiella burnetii,_ 0.4% (_n_ = 4) for _Borrelia_ spp., and 0.2% (_n_ = 2) for _Bartonella_ spp. The co-infection rate (3.4%, _n_ = 32) involved mainly _Rickettsia_ spp. and Anaplasmataceae. Of the _Rickettsia_ spp. positive ticks, the targeted PCR and sequencing yielded _Rickettsia africae_ (78.9%)_, Rickettsia aeschlimannii_ (6.4%), _Rickettsia massiliae_ (7.8%), _Candidatus_ Rickettsia barbariae (0.9%), and _Rickettsia_ sp. (0.9%). Anaplasmataceae included _Anaplasma marginale_ (4.3%), _Anaplasma platys_ (1.4%), _Anaplasma centrale_ (0.7%), _Ehrlichia ruminantium_ (0.7%), _Wolbachia_ sp., _Candidatus_ Ehrlichia rustica (13.5%), _Candidatus_ Ehrlichia urmitei (7%), and an uncultured _Ehrlichia_ sp. (4.2%). _Borrelia theileri_ was identified in one _Rhipicephalus microplus_ tick. Unfortunately, Piroplasmida could not be identified to the species level. This study demonstrates that in Cameroon, ticks harbour a wide variety of microorganisms and present a risk of zoonotic diseases. [Full article](/2076-2607/10/10/1957)

Given that human _Campylobacter jejuni_ infections are rising globally and antibiotic treatment is not recommended, infected patients would substantially benefit from alternative therapeutic strategies. Short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate are known for their health benefits, including anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects. This prompted us to investigate potential disease-alleviating properties of butyrate treatment during acute murine _C. jejuni_-induced enterocolitis. Therefore, following gut microbiota depletion IL-10−/− mice were challenged with 109 viable _C. jejuni_ cells by oral gavage and treated with butyrate via the drinking water (22 g/L) starting on day 2 post-infection. As early as day 3 post-infection, butyrate reduced diarrheal severity and frequency in treated mice, whereas on day 6 post-infection, gastrointestinal _C. jejuni_ burdens and the overall clinical outcomes were comparable in butyrate- and placebo-treated cohorts. Most importantly, butyrate treatment dampened intestinal pro-inflammatory immune responses given lower colonic numbers of apoptotic cells and neutrophils, less distinct TNF-α secretion in mesenteric lymph nodes and lower IL-6 and MCP-1 concentrations in the ileum. In conclusion, results of our preclinical intervention study provide evidence that butyrate represents a promising candidate molecule for the treatment of acute campylobacteriosis.

Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) may be potential adjuvant immunotherapy for COVID-19 patients. In this work, we assessed gene expression profiles associated with the IFN-γ pathway in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Employing a case-control study from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative patients, we identified IFN-γ-associated pathways to be enriched in positive patients. Bioinformatics analyses showed upregulation of _MAP2K6_, _CBL_, _RUNX3_, _STAT1,_ and _JAK2_ in COVID-19-positive vs. -negative patients. A positive correlation was observed between _STAT1_/_JAK2_, which varied alongside the patient’s viral load. Expression of _MX1_, _MX2_, _ISG15,_ and _OAS1_ (four well-known IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs)) displayed upregulation in COVID-19-positive vs. -negative patients. Integrative analyses showcased higher levels of ISGs, which were associated with increased viral load and _STAT1_/_JAK2_ expression. Confirmation of ISGs up-regulation was performed in vitro using the A549 lung cell line treated with Poly (I:C), a synthetic analog of viral double-stranded RNA; and in different pulmonary human cell lines and ferret tracheal biopsies infected with SARS-CoV-2. A pre-clinical murine model of Coronavirus infection confirmed findings displaying increased ISGs in the liver and lungs from infected mice. Altogether, these results demonstrate the role of IFN-γ and ISGs in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting alternative druggable targets that can boost the host response.

Herein, we report the isolation, structure elucidation and a proposed biosynthesis of the new congener myxochelin B-succinate from the terrestrial myxobacterial strain MSr12020, featuring a succinyl decoration at its primary amine group. Myxochelin-B-succinate exhibited antibacterial growth inhibition and moderate cytotoxic activity against selected human cancer cell lines. This unique chemical modification of myxochelin B might provide interesting insights for future microbiological studies to understand the biological function and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite succinylation.
