## Prepublication Classification Review Board

Interested in publishing your work? If you’re a current or former CIA employee or contractor, you’ll need to submit your publication to the Prepublication Classification Review Board (formerly called the Publication Review Board). The Prepublication Classification Review Board reviews all publications prior to public release to protect classified information and U.S. national security.
