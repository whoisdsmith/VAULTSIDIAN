**1. Introduction** Adult  ADHD  affects  an  estimated  3%  to  5%  of  adults  world­ wide.  It  is  seen  in  4.4%  (62%  male,  38%  female)  of  the  US adult  population  [1].  CNS  stimulants,  namely,  ampheta­ mine  based  stimulants,  methylphenidate,  dextrometham­ phetamine,  dextromethylphenidate,  and  modafinil,  are  the first  line  of  treatment  for  ADHD.  CNS  stimulants  act  by inhibiting  reuptake  of  norepinephrine  and  dopamine  as well  as  increasing  their  release  into  the  extracellular  space. Approximately,  2%  of  American  adults  in  20-44  age  groups were  using  stimulant  medications  for  ADHD  in  2010  which was  a  significant  increase  in  use  among  both  males  and females  (+188%  and  +265%,  resp.)  when  compared  to  the prior  decade  [2].  In  the  study  by  Gerhard  et  al.,  10.5%  of  adult ADHD  patients  had  evidence  of  >1  preexisting  cardiovascular condition.  Even  in  patients  with  preexisting  cardiovascular

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  a  chronic  neurobiological  disorder  exhibited  by  difficulty  maintaining attention,  as  well  as  hyperactivity  and  impulsive  behavior.  Central  nervous  system  (CNS)  stimulants  are  the  first  line  of  treatment for  ADHD.  With  the  increase  in  number  of  adults  on  CNS  stimulants,  the  question  that  arises  is  how  well  do  we  understand the  long-term  cardiovascular  effects  of  these  drugs.  There  has  been  increasing  concern  that  adults  with  ADHD  are  at  greater  risk for  developing  adverse  cardiovascular  events  such  as  sudden  death,  myocardial  infarction,  and  stroke  as  compared  to  pediatric population.  Cardiovascular  response  attributed  to  ADHD  medication  has  mainly  been  observed  in  heart  rate  and  blood  pressure elevations,  while  less  is  known  about  the  etiology  of  rare  cardiovascular  events  like  acute  myocardial  infarction  (AMI),  arrhythmia, and cardiomyopathy  and its  long-term sequelae.  We present  a unique  case of  AMI in  an adult  taking Adderall  (mixed amphetamine salts) and briefly discuss the literature relevant to the cardiovascular safety of CNS stimulants for adult ADHD.

## conditions,  close  to  80%  of  all  ADHD  medications  initiated 

were  stimulants.  The  knowledge  of  preexisting  cardiovascular 

conditions  did  not  significantly  reduce  the  likelihood  of 

Adults  with  ADHD  are  possibly  at  higher  risk  for  devel­

oping  unhealthy  lifestyle  and  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  such 

as  smoking  and  obesity,  and  have  a  greater  probability  of 

chronic  substance  misuse.  Studies  suggest  that  adult  ADHD 

patients  are  more  likely  to  experiment  with  licit  and  illicit  sub­

stances,  especially  at  earlier  ages,  and  exhibit  risky  substance 

use  patterns  and  subsequently  develop  substance  use  disor­

ders  [4,5].  ADHD  patients  also  have  cooccurring  psychiatric 

disorders,  like  anxiety  (47%),  mood  disorder  (38%),  poor 

impulse  control  (20%),  and  substance  use  disorders  (15%)  [1]. 

These  individuals  can  be  on  a  number  of  medications  along 

with  stimulant  drugs;  effect  of  combination  drug  therapy  on

2 Case Reports in Cardiology

It  is  possible  that,  in  adults  on  CNS  stimulant  therapy, chances  of  having  other  cardiovascular  risk  factors  may increase  with  each  passing  decade  of  life.  Scrutiny  has recently  increased,  primarily  due  to  marked  increase  in  the use  of  CNS  stimulants  among  adults  [6].  AMI  as  well  as atrial  fibrillation  has  been  previously  reported  in  cases  of recreational  amphetamine  abuse  [7]  and  also  in  adolescent ADHD  patients  on  stimulant  therapy  [8].  Here,  we  discuss  a rare  case  of  AMI  and  atrial  fibrillation  in  an  adult  who  was  on mixed  amphetamine  salts  and  briefly  review  pertinent  litera­ ture.

**2.  Case** A  31-year-old  Caucasian  man  presented  to  the  emergency room  with  palpitations  associated  with  shortness  of  breath and  lightheadedness.  He  was  diagnosed  with  ADHD  at  15 years of  age and  was prescribed  mixed amphetamine  salts. His starting  dose  of  mixed  amphetamine  salts  was  7.5  mg  and  he took  it  for  5  years  after  the  diagnosis.  He  restarted  taking  it  6 months  prior  to  presentation  as  his  symptoms  were  interfer­ ing  with  his  daily  activities.  He  had  been  prescribed  20  mg  of mixed  amphetamine  salts  twice  daily  but  three  months  back had  cut  back  on  his  dose  to  20  mg  once  a  day,  on  account of  intermittent  self-limiting  episodes  of  palpitations  lasting 5-10  minutes.  He  did  not  seek  medical  attention  for  these symptoms.  On  the  day  of  presentation,  he  had  taken  mixed amphetamine  salts  20  mg  in  the  morning  and  later  took  10  mg in  the  afternoon.  However,  that  evening  he  also  consumed four  16-ounce  beers  but  denied  any  smoking  or  use  of  illicit drugs.  After  about  1-2  hours,  he  developed  significant  palpita­ tions  that  were  different  in  nature  and  lasted  longer  along  with shortness  of  breath  and  lightheadedness  without  any  chest pain, nausea, or diaphoresis. His  past  medical  history  was  unremarkable  except  for ADHD.  He  did  not  have  other  symptoms  or  signs  sugges­ tive  of  pheochromocytoma  or  hyperthyroidism.  There  was no  family  history  of  cardiovascular  diseases.  He  admitted occasional  use  of  alcohol  and  marijuana  (once  a  month)  but denied  the  use  of  energy  drinks  or  other  illicit  drugs.  He  had no  known  drug  allergies  and  took  no  other  medications  other than  mixed  amphetamine  salts.  On  physical  examination,  his heart  rate  was  92  beats  per  minute,  respirations  were  20,  and blood  pressure  was  90/53  mm  of  Hg.  His  cardiac  exam  was significant  for  irregularly  irregular  heart  sounds  of  varying intensity.  His  lung  fields  were  clear  and  he  was  alert  and  ori­ ented  to  person,  place,  and  time.  A  12-lead  electrocardiogram (EKG)  revealed  atrial  fibrillation  with  an  average  ventricular response  of  98  bpm  and  ST  elevations  in  leads  I,  aVL,  VI,  and V2  with  reciprocal  changes  in  leads  III  and  aVF  (Figure  1(a)). The  EKG  after  13  minutes  showed  resolution  of  the  ST segment elevations (Figure 1(b)). His  initial  set  of  cardiac  enzymes  was  CPK:  138  U/E, CK-MB:  5.9ng/mE,  troponin  I:  0.13ng/mL,  and  myoglobin: 4.7  ng/mL.  He  received  aspirin  325  mg.  He  was  later  admitted to  the  cardiac  unit  for  hemodynamic  monitoring  and  serial cardiac  enzymes,  EKGs,  and  assessment  of  left  ventricular (LV)  function.  Subsequent  troponin  levels  rapidly  increased to  6.91  ng/mF.  The  rest  of  his  cardiac  enzymes  were  CPK: 

## 387  U/E,  CK-MB:  77.9  ng/mL,  and  myoglobin:  34  ng/mL. Chest  X-ray  was  normal.  All  of  his  routine  laboratories including  lipid  profile  were  unremarkable.  His  TSH  was 1.83  U/mL  and  free  T4  was  0.91  ng/dL.  The  urine  drug  screen was  positive  for  amphetamines  only.  A  transthoracic  echocar­ diogram  showed  normal  LV  dimensions  and  good  LV  systolic function,  without  evidence  of  wall  motion  abnormalities.  He also  underwent  coronary  angiography  that  did  not  reveal  any epicardial  coronary  artery  disease.  He  was  treated  with  oral diltiazem  30  mg  three  times  daily  and  the  patient’s  symptoms and  atrial  fibrillation  resolved  (Figure  1(c)).  Serum  troponin levels  started  trending  down  by  second  day.  The  final  diag­ nosis  of  AMI  and  atrial  fibrillation  secondary  to  mixed amphetamine  salts  use  was  made.  Patient  had  uneventful hospital course and was discharged on third day.

**3.  Discussion** Adderall,  formulation  of  D-amphetamine  and  L-amphetamine  salts  in  the  ratio  of  3:1,  is  a  prescription  CNS  stimulant drug for  ADHD and  is used  in all  age groups.  The exact  mech­ anism  of  cardiovascular  impact  of  stimulants  is  unknown. The  proposed  mechanisms  by  which  stimulants  may  give rise  to  adverse  cardiovascular  events  are  (a)  by  elevating blood  pressure  (BP)  and  increasing  the  heart  rate  (HR)  [9], 

## (b)  increased  levels  of  circulating  catecholamines  inducing vasospasm  [10],  (c)  higher  levels  of  circulating  proinflammatory immunoactive glycation end products causing vasculitis

[11],  (d)  inducing  QT  interval  prolongation  which  is  associ­ ated  with  torsades  de  pointes  [12],  and  (e)  coronary  artery intimal hyperplasia [13].

Amphetamines  have  acute  chronotropic  and  pressor effects.  The  cardiovascular  epidemiological  literature  has shown  that  even  modest  increases  in  BP  and  HR  have been  associated  with  increased  risk  of  adverse  cardiovascular events  [14-17].  In  the  meta-analysis  carried  out  by  Mick  et  al. on  2665  adult  patients,  it  was  observed  that  CNS  stimulants used  for  adult  ADHD  were  associated  with  a  statistically significant  increase  in  resting  heart  rate  of  5.7  bpm  and increase  in  systolic  blood  pressure  of  1.2  mmHg  but  not  of diastolic  blood  pressure.  A  low  overall  risk  (<5%)  of  clinically significant  cardiovascular  events,  including  tachycardia  or hypertension,  was  also  observed  [18].  Epidemiological  studies have  demonstrated  that  elevated  resting  heart  rate  is  a  sig­ nificant  independent  predictor  of  mortality  and  a  shorter  life expectancy  [16,17].  Cooney  et  al.  demonstrated  that  15bpm increase  in  heart  rate  was  found  to  increase  the  rate  of  car­ diovascular  disease  mortality  by  23-50%  in  men  and  women 

[16].  Perret-Guillaume  et  al.  showed  that  heart  rate  increase of  10  bpm  is  associated  with  a  20%  increased  risk  of  cardiac death  [17].  HR  increases  comparable  with  those  observed with  CNS  stimulant  treatment  for  adult  ADHD  have  been associated  with  a  17%  increased  cardiovascular  mortality  [19] and  about  8%  in  those  with  coronary  artery  disease  [20].  In another  study  carried  out  by  Wilens  et  al.,  statistically  sig­ nificant  change  in  systolic  blood  pressure  by  about  5  mm  Hg and  diastolic  blood  pressure  of  about  7  mm  Hg  was  observed. Blood pressure variations of this magnitude, in particular

during  long-term  therapy,  have  been  acknowledged  to increase morbidity and mortality [21]. Abnormal  sympathetic  and  parasympathetic  cardiac inputs  secondary  to  stimulant  use  can  result  in  increased myocardial  excitability  and  conductance.  Patients  with  exag­ gerated  sympathetic  nervous  system  activity  are  more  sus­ ceptible  to  develop  clinically  significant  cardiac  arrhythmias typically  more  in  the  setting  of  an  underlying  structural heart  defect  [22].  There  are  very  few  reports  associating amphetamine-dextroamphetamine  therapy  to  new  onset atrial  fibrillation  [23]  and  atrial  flutter  [24].  A  recent  case series  analysis  study  conducted  in  1224  patients  aged  <17 years  showed  increased  risk  of  arrhythmia  in  all  exposed  time periods  (incidence  rate  ratio  1.61,  95%  confidence  interval 1.48 to  1.74), and  the risk  was highest  in the  children with  con­ genital  heart  disease.  The  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  was higher  between  8  and  56  days  after  the  start  of  treatment  with methylphenidate.  Overall,  for  all  exposed  time  periods  there was  no  significant  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  (1.33,  0.90  to 1.98).  There  was  no  significant  increased  risk  for  hyperten­ sion, ischemic stroke, or heart failure [25]. Other  CNS  stimulants  such  as  modafinil  and  methyl­ phenidate  have  also  been  rarely  reported  to  cause  frequent premature  ventricular  contractions  [26].  Zhang  et  al.  showed that  long  QT  syndrome  patients  especially  males,  when treated  with  ADHD  medications,  had  higher  risk  of  unfa­ vorable  cardiac  events  during  follow-up.  The  stimulant  drugs 

did  not  significantly  change  average  QTc  interval.  Small proportion  of  individuals  in  the  study  cohort  however  did have  increment  in  QTc  by  30-60  milliseconds  to  above  470500 milliseconds [27].

The  three  most  important  observational  studies  con­ ducted  on  adults  that  address  whether  prescription  stim­ ulant  and  nonstimulant  drugs  are  associated  with  adverse cardiovascular  events  are  by  Holick  et  al.,  Schelleman  et  al., and  Habel  et  al.  [28-30].  Holick  et  al.  conducted  their  study on  matched  cohort  of  21,606  stimulant  ADHD  medication initiators,  21,606  atomoxetine  initiators,  and  42,993  age  and sex  matched  general  population  cohort  (greater  than  or  equal to 18  years of  age) between  2003 and  2006. They  observed an increased  risk  of  transient  ischemic  attack  only  and  not  of stroke,  among  adult  ADHD  medication  starters  when  com­ pared  to  the  general  population,  in  their  secondary  analysis. However,  unlike  the  primary  analysis  the  general  population cohort  was  not  matched  with  the  combined  atomoxetine  and prescription  stimulant  user  cohort  using  propensity  matching 

[28].

Schelleman  et  al.  matched  43,999  new  methylphenidate users to 175,955  nonusers in adults  (greater than or  equal to 18 years  of  age)  and  reported  that  methylphenidate  is  associated with  a  1.8-  fold  increased  risk  of  sudden  death  or  ventricular arrhythmia,  but  no  similar  trend  was  noted  for  stroke,  myo­ cardial  infarction,  or  combined  stroke/myocardial  infarction. The  drawback  with  this  study  was  that  primary  analyses  were

4 Case Reports in Cardiology

adjusted  for  age  and  data  source  only.  There  was  smaller but  significantly  increased  risks  of  sudden  death,  ventricular arrhythmia,  and  all-cause  death,  similar  to  primary  analyses, with  subsequent  analyses  using  propensity  scores  to  address confounding factors [29].

Most  extensive  and  largest  of  the  three  adult  studies carried  out  by  Habel  et  al.  did  not  report  any  increased  risk of  myocardial  infarction,  sudden  cardiac  death,  and  stroke among  150,359  adults  ADHD  prescription  stimulant  users during  short  median  exposure  (0.33  years)  when  compared  to 292,839 nonusers  in adults  aged 25  years to  64 years.  Surpris­ ingly,  statistical  results  suggested  that  ADHD  medications have  protective  effect  with  regard  to  serious  cardiovascular outcome  which  according  to  the  authors  themselves  is  bio­ logically  implausible  and  most  likely  could  be  attributed  to  be biased  by a  “healthy user  effect” [30].  Patient  pool in  the above three  observational  studies  was  less  selective  as  compared  to randomized  clinical  trial  but  certainly  healthier  than  the  gen­ eral  adult  ADHD  population.  The  biggest  limitation  of  Habel et  al.s  study  is  consideration  of  only  severe  cardiovascular events  that  dampened  the  absolute  conclusion  in  spite  of  big sample size.

These  results  were  similar  to  two  other  studies  that  were conducted  in  children  and  young  adults.  McCarthy  et  al. showed  no  increase  in  risk  of  sudden  death  associated  with stimulants  and  atomoxetine  in  patients  aged  2-21  years  [31]. Cooper  et  al.  conducted  a  retrospective  cohort  study  in children  and  young  adults  aged  2-24  years  and  showed  that current  users  of  ADHD  drugs  were  not  at  increased  risk  for serious  cardiovascular  events,  although  the  upper  limit  of  the 95%  confidence  interval  indicated  that  a  doubling  of  the  risk could  not  be  ruled  out.  However,  the  absolute  magnitude  of such an increased risk would be low [32].

Safety  concerns  with  regard  to  prescriptions  stimulants use  have  guided  governmental  regulatory  policy  from  time to  time.  Current  clinical  recommendations  emphasize  the need  to  assess  the  patients  personal  and  family  cardiac history  prior  to  initiation  of  ADHD  pharmacotherapy,  being vigilant  about  abnormal  cardiovascular  history  (e.g.,  prema­ ture  sudden/unexpected  death  in  children  or  young  adults, clinically  important  arrhythmias,  prolonged  QT  syndrome, hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy,  and  Marfan  syndrome)  [33]. HR  and  BP  should  be  measured  before  initiating  medications and  routinely  during  treatment.  Universal  EKG  screening  has not been  shown to  be cost  effective, as  it has  not demonstrated any  incremental  benefit  in  preventing  sudden  cardiac  death in  children  with  ADHD  [34].  EKG  screening  and  cardiologist consultation  are  recommended  for  ADHD  patients  who have  positive  history  of  structural  cardiac  abnormalities  [35] and  even  though  baseline  EKG  before  initiating  ADHD medications  is  considered  reasonable  by  ACC/AHA  [36],  it is not endorsed by American Academy of pediatrics [33].

Ours  is  the  first  case  report  of  AMI  and  atrial  fibrillation in  an  adult  who  was  on  short  acting  mixed  amphetamine salts  without  intention  to  overdose  or  abuse,  to  the  best  of our  knowledge.  Patient  reduced  his  earlier  dose  of  20  mg  of mixed  amphetamine  salts  twice  daily  to  20  mg  once  daily. He  did  however  consume  higher  than  his  daily  total  dose 

(30  mg  «—  20  mg)  of  mixed  amphetamine  salts  on  the  day  of 

presentation.  The  temporal  association  of  AMI  and  atrial  fib­

rillation  with  higher  than  usual  dose  of  mixed  amphetamine 

salts  makes  amphetamines  the  most  plausible  etiology.  It  is 

difficult  to  ascertain  whether  atrial  fibrillation  occurred  inde­

pendently  or  it  was  exacerbated  by  higher  than  usual  dose  of 

stimulant.  The  simultaneous  use  of  alcohol  with  stimulants 

may  have  had  additive  effects.  Cytochrome  P450  enzymes 

in  the  liver  areinvolved  in  metabolism  of  both  alcohol  and 

amphetamine.  Alcohol  competes  with  amphetamine  for  the 

metabolism  in  the  liver  and  hence  may  enhance  the  bioavail-

ability of amphetamine [37, 38]

In  an  adult  stimulant  user,  in  absence  of  cardiovascular 

risk  factors,  coronary  vasospasm  either  epicardial  or  micro-

vascular  may  be  a  predominant  reason  for  AMI.  Such  patients 

usually  present  with  atypical  chest  pain.  The  diagnosis  of 

AMI  involves  elevation  of  myocardial  necrosis  biomarkers, 

ischemic  symptoms,  and  EKG  changes.  Management  of  such 

patients  is  guided  by  clinical  presentation  and  initial  imaging 

studies  employed  to  assess  left  ventricular  function  and  coro­

nary  patency.  Those  with  persistent  chest  pain,  hemodynamic 

instability,  and  rising  troponin  levels  should  be  managed  on 

a case-by-case basis.

Adult  ADHD  is  significantly  impairing  and  the  use  of 

CNS  stimulants  among  adults  is  on  the  rise.  It  is  likely 

that  in  coming  years  increasing  number  of  unhealthy  adult 

ADHD  population  is  going  to  be  exposed  to  CNS  stimulant 

treatment.  Definite  conclusions  regarding  the  overall  cardio­

vascular  safety  of  these  agents  cannot  currently  be  made  for 

patients  at  varying  risk  for  cardiovascular  disease  or  in  rela­

tion  to  chronic  treatment  exposure.  At  present,  there  is  less 

data  available  to  guide  and  inform  clinical  practice  in  many 

patients  with  adult  ADHD  and  concomitant  cardiovascular 

disease and/or risk factors.

**4.  Conclusion**

## The  ongoing  debate  about  the  cardiovascular  safety  of  these 

medications  is  here  to  stay  and  underscores  the  challenge  in 

conclusively  establishing  safety  and  the  need  to  evaluate  risk 

in  the  context  of  the  evolving  clinical  practice.  Prospective 

scientific  investigations  should  include  systemic  cardiovas­

cular  monitoring  in  clinical  trials,  more  extensive  and  pro­

longed  cardiovascular  studies,  and  large-scale  epidemiologic 

studies  to  help  gain  insight  with  regard  to  both  the  short-

and  longer-term  cardiovascular  impact  of  CNS  stimulants  in 

adults with ADHD.
