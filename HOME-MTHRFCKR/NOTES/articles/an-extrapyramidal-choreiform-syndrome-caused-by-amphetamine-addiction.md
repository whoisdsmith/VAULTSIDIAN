### Short report

## An extrapyramidal choreiform syndrome caused by amphetamine addiction H LUNDH AND K TUNVING

# From the Departments of Neurology and Psychiatric Research, University of Lund, Sweden

### summary  Four  cases  are  described  to  demonstrate  the  extrapyramidal  clinical  syndrome sometimes  appearing  in  chronic  amphetamine  users.  The  symptoms  are  dominated  by  choreiform or  athetoid  movements,  ataxia  and  disturbances  of  gait.  The  syndrome  develops  during  am­ phetamine  abuse  and  may  be  observed  also  during  abstinence.  The  symptoms  usually  disappear within a week when the drug is discontinued, but may remain for years.

The mental symptoms,  including psychosis, caused by  amphetamine  intoxication  are  well-known,1 but  neurological  side-effects  sometimes  appearing are  much  less  recognised.  Choreo-athetoid  move­ ments caused  by high  doses of  amphetamine have been  mentioned  in  the  literature2  3  and  a  “jerking syndrome”  was  reported  by  Rylander.4  We  give a  more  comprehensive  description  of  this  syn­ drome  and  point  out  that  it  may  remain  for  years after finishing drug abuse.

#### **Case reports**

Case 1 A  man,  now  aged  27  years,  during  the  period  1971— 1977  injected  himself  intravenously  with  high  doses (gram  doses)  of  amphetamine  one  to  four  times  a  day except  for  short  periods  of  abstinence.  A  few  months after  starting  to  inject  amphetamine  he  suffered  from more  or  less  constant  grinding  of  his  teeth  and  in­ voluntary  choreiform  movements  of  his  face  around his  mouth.  Only  a  few  months  later  he  developed generalised  choreiform  and  athetoid  movements  of arms,  legs  and  body.  His  gait  was  markedly  disturbed, his  legs  flung  erratically  and  irregularly  sideways,  there were  constant  large  and  small  involuntary  movements of  his  arms,  and  different  parts  of  his  body  rapidly jerked  from  side  to  side  and  forwards  and  backwards. Quick choreiform movements dominated, but he also

showed  slower  more  athetoid  movements  of  his  trunk, arms  and  fingers.  The  strong  reeling  involuntary movements  of  the  trunk  rendered  a  dancing  or drunken  appearance  to  the  gait  and  the  patient  was known  as  “the  screw.”  Symptoms  were  more  pro­ nounced  just  after  an  injection  of  amphetamine  but did  not  disappear  during  periods  of  abstinence.  When performing  voluntary  motor  activities  like  the  finger­ nose  or  heel-knee  test  the  involuntary  movements diminished  and  the  patient  could  play  different  sorts of ballgames.

After  he  stopped  amphetamine  abuse  the  involun­ tary  movements  gradually  diminished  but  not  until 

1978,  a  year  afterwards,  did  they  decrease  markedly. Three  years  afterwards,  in  1980,  the  patient  still suffered  from  teeth  grinding  and  involuntary  grimacing of  his  face.  Apart  from  this  his  motor  performance and gait now is normal.

Case 2 At  the  age  of  20  years  this  man  began  to  abuse  am­ phetamine  and  during  the  following  4-5  years  inter­ mittently  injected  several  grams  of  amphetamine 

intravenously  daily  for  periods  of  one  to  several  weeks. 

At  the  age  of  24  years  he  stopped  using  amphetamine and  changed  to  morphine.  He  claimed  he  changed because  of  adverse  reactions  after  amphetamine  in­ jections.  During  his  period  as  an  amphetamine  addict he  was  admitted  twice  to  the  psychiatric  ward  for detoxification.  Each  time  he  showed  dramatic  extra­ pyramidal  symptoms.  His  gait  was  markedly  ataxic and  he  could  not  walk  straight  forward  but  con­

stantly  pushed  against  the  walls  of  the  corridor,  his 

legs  vigorously  jerking  irregularly  and  his  arms  per­

forming large, abrupt, rapid ballistic movements like 728

An extrapyramidal choreiform syndrome caused by amphetamine addiction

### the  arms  of  a  windmill.  His  head  moved  abruptly and  irregularly  in  all  directions.  He  was  treated  by large  intravenous  doses  of  biperiden  hydrochloride (Akineton)  and  haloperidol  but  his  involuntary  move­ ments  continued,  and  48  hours  passed  before  he  could sleep.  His  involuntary  movements  almost  disappeared during  sleep.  Within  a  week  his  involuntary  move­ ments diminished and, finally, vanished completely.

Case 3 This  man  was  admitted  to  the  ward  at  the  age  of 20  years  after  one  year  of  continuous  intravenous abuse  of  large  doses  of  amphetamine.  He  was  hyper­

active  and  unable  to  sit  or  stand  and  continually changed  his  position.  There  were  almost  continuous choreiform  movements  of  his  facial  muscles,  body, arms  and  legs.  The  patient’s  gait  was  wide-based  and 

obviously  ataxic,  being  fast  and  stiff  with  rapid  jerking 

movements  somewhat  like  an  actor  in  a  fast  moving 

film  resembling  the  gait  seen  in  Huntington’s  chorea. 

This  patient  was  treated  orally  by  central  cholinergic 

blocking  drugs  (the  atropine  group  of  drugs),  and 

became  almost  free  of  symptoms.  A  month  after  ad­

mission  to  the  ward  he  ran  away  and  again  injected 

amphetamine,  but  he  soon  returned  with  an  exacerba­

tion  of  choreiform  movements.  In  the  following  years 

the  patient  had  several  relapses  of  drug  abuse  and 

every  time  the  neurological  symptoms  reappeared. 

Finally  he  stopped  drug  abuse  and  after  that  the 

choreiform  movements  gradually  decreased  and  dis­

appeared entirely after more than a year.

Case 4

This  man,  now  aged  35  years,  from  1965  to  1972 

almost  continuously  took  amphetamine  by  mouth  at 

a  dose  of  about  0  3  gram  two  or  three  times  a  day. 

During  that  time  he  suffered  from  general  hyper­

activity  with  stereotyped,  compulsive  behaviour  such 

as  repetitively  buttoning  and  unbuttoning  his  jacket 

or  tidying  up  over  and  over  again,  i.e.  punding.1  From 

1972  to  1977  the  patient  took  amphetamine  intra­

venously  in  high  doses  (about  one  gram  per  injection). 

After  daily  injections  for  six  months  continuous 

jerking  involuntary  movements  of  arms  and  legs 

began,  most  pronounced  in  proximal  muscles,  together 

with  involuntary  grinding  of  his  teeth.  On  several 

occasions  there  were  short  episodes  of  spasmodic 

torticollis  which  always  disappeared  when  treated 

with  diazepam.  His  choreiform  movements  continued 

even  during  periods  of  drug  abstinence  for  weeks  or 

months  and  did  not  diminish  when  the  patient  did 

not  inject  amphetamine  for  one  year  1977-1978.  He 

had  a  short  relapse  into  abuse  in  1978,  but  after  that 

he  has  not  used  drugs  for  three  years.  Since  1978  his 

involuntary  movements  have  diminished  but  not  dis­

appeared.  They  are  temporarily  suppressed  by  vol­

untary  movements  and  do  not  interfere  with  fine 

motor  activity  and  disappear  during  sleep.  They  are 

less  pronounced  when  the  patient  is  calm  and  relaxed 

and  become  more  obvious  when  he  is  tired  or  nervous. 

In 1980 this patient was treated with flupenthixol

the head in 1980 was normal.
