### **ABSTRACT**

**Our  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  the  new  wake-promoting  drug  modafinil  to** **that  of  dextroamphetamine  for  the  treatment  of  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder** **(ADHD)  in  adults.  Twenty-two  adults  who  met  DSM-IV  criteria  for  ADHD  participated  in** **a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  three-phase  crossover  study  comparing** **placebo,  modafinil,  and  dextroamphetamine  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD.  The  twice-daily** **study  medications  were  titrated  to  doses  of  optimum  efficacy  over  4-7  days  and  then  held** **constant  during  the  rest  of  each  2-week  treatment  phase.  Measures  of  improvement  included** **the  DSM-IV  ADHD  Behavior  Checklist  for  Adults,  the  Controlled  Oral  Word  Association** **Test  (COWAT,  using  the  letters  C,  F,  and  L  version),  Stroop,  and  Digit  Span  (Wechsler** **Adult  Intelligence  Scale  version).  For  the  21  (96%)  completers,  the  mean  (±SD)  optimum** 

**doses  of  modafinil  and  dextroamphetamine  were  206.8  mg/day  ±  84.9  and  21.8  mg/day  ±** 

**8.9,  respectively.  Scores  on  the  DSM-IV  ADHD  Checklist** **(p  <0.001)  were  significantly  im­**

**proved  over  the  placebo  condition  following  treatment  with  both  active  medications.  Per­**

====**formance  on  the  COWAT** ====**(p  <====0.05)  reached  trend  levels  of  significance.  Both  medications**==== 

====**were  generally  well  tolerated.  This  preliminary  study  suggests  that  modafinil  may  be  a  vi­**

====**able alternative to conventional stimulants for the treatment of adults with ADHD.**

### ====**INTRODUCTION**

# <sup>f  the approximately5%  of  children  with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD),  18-30%</sup> 

of them may  carry the diagnosis  into adulthood (Mannuzza  et al. 1993).  Stimulants have been the  treat­

ment of  choice for  ADHD in  both children  and adults  (Biederman 1998),  but they  may have  undesirable 

side  effects  and  potential  for  abuse  (Zametkin  and  Rapoport  1987).  Modafinil,  a  medication  with  few  side 

effects and  a low  abuse potential  (Ferraro et  al. 1997;  Wong et  al. 1999)  would be  a useful  addition to  cur­

### TAYLOR AND RUSSO

(peak  plasma  concentrations  are  achieved  within  2  to  4  h),  an  elimination  half-life  of  about  15  h,  and  has a  relatively  benign  safety  profile  (US  Modafinil  in  Narcolepsy  Study  Group  1998;  Wong  et  al.  1999). Modafinil  is  chemically  and  pharmacologically  distinct  from  traditional  psychostimulants.  Unlike  amphet­ amine  stimulants,  modafinil  probably  promotes  vigilance  via  non-dopaminergic/adrenergic  mechanisms (Ferraro  et  al.  1997;  Lin  et  al.  1992,  1996;  Simon  et  al.  1995).  Instead,  modafinil  appears  indirectly  to  ac­ tivate  the  frontal  cortex  via  the  hypothalamus  and/or  the  tuberomammilary  nucleus  (Chemelli  et  al.  1999; Eastbrooke et  al. 1999;  Lin et  al. 1996).  Whether agents  that activate  the hypothalamic  arousal system  could be  of  benefit  for  ADHD  is  unknown.  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  same  stimulants  effective  for  the  treatment of  ADHD  are  also  effective  for  narcolepsy.  Together,  these  neurochemical  and  pharmachological  proper­ ties suggest  that modafinil  may have  some value  in the  treatment of  ADHD, but  to date  there have  been no clinical trials of this drug in those with ADHD.

The  primary  intent  of  this  study  was,  therefore,  to  determine  if  modafinil  is  a  viable  alternative  to  stim­

ulants  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD,  and  if  so,  at  what  doses.  We  compared  the  efficacy  of  modafinil,  dex­

troamphetamine  (^-amphetamine),  and  placebo  in  adults  with  ADHD  using  a  randomized,  double-blind, 

placebo-controlled,  three-phase  crossover  study  design.  Our  hypothesis  was  that  the  wake-promoting  drug 

modafinil would be effective in the treatment of ADHD.

## Subjects

### **METHODS**

The  subjects  were  people  more  than  21  years  old  from  a  single  local  community.  They  were  told  of  the 

study  by  their  health  care  providers,  and  if  they  expressed  an  interest  were  told  how  to  contact  the  outpa­

tient  clinic  of  the  first  author.  Those  subjects  meeting  entry  criteria  were  consecutively  identified.  The  na­

ture  of  the  study  was  fully  explained  before  obtaining  written  informed  consent  from  the  22  participants. 

All  patients  underwent  an  assessment  for  ADHD,  including  a  neurological  exam;  clinical,  developmental, 

and  childhood  histories;  and  a  semi-structured  interview.  To  be  given  a  diagnosis  of  adult  ADHD,  subjects 

had  to  (a)  meet  the  full Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  fourth  edition  (DSM-IV; 

American  Psychiatric  Association  1994)  criteria  for  the  disorder  by  the  age  of  7  years  as  well  as  currently, 

(b) describe  a chronic  course of  ADHD symptoms,  (c) endorse  at least  a moderate  level of  impairment from 

the  symptoms,  and  (d)  provide  corroborating  history  of  the  disorder  from  at  least  one  parent  or  older  sib­

ling.  The  history  included  inquiry  as  to  the  nature  and  extent  of  the  subject’s  behaviors  that  could  be  in­

dicative  of  childhood  ADHD.  We  also  looked  for  other  evidence  of  ADHD,  such  as  from  report  cards, 

====schoolwork, or results of prior psychological testing.

====The  DSM-IV  ADHD  Behavior  Checklist  for  Adults  was  also  used  to  select  study  subjects.  This  DSM-IV-

====based scale has age-matched cu toff values and scoring  above the 93rd percentile of  symptom severity, which 

====has  been  found  to  be  a  good  predictor  of  a  correct  diagnosis  of  ADHD  (Murphy  and  Barkley  1996).  This 

====18-item  checklist  has  two  9-item  subscales  for  evaluating  inattentive  and  hyperactive-impulsive  symptoms. 

====Each item is rated  for severity in terms  of how often the  symptoms are present (maximum  score of 54 points). 

Therefore,  to  be  eligible  for  the  study,  patients  were  required  to  score  above  the  93rd  percentile  of  severity 

for at  least one  subtype of  ADHD on  both the  childhood and  adult versions  of this  scale. For  example, to  be 

eligible,  adults  aged b etween 1 7 and  29 ye ars had a  combined score of 1 4.7 o r hi gher, a nd t hose bet ween 

30 and 49  years a score  of 12.0 or  higher on the  adult scale. Subjects  were then diagnosed  as having ADHD 

of the primarily inattentive subtype, the primarily hyperactive-impulsive subtype, or the combined subtype.

Exclusion  criteria  included  narcolepsy  and  conditions  associated  with  altered  cognitive  abilities  includ­

ing  schizophrenia,  Tourette’s  disorder,  and  diagnosable  neurologic  conditions.  Motor  tasks  including  the 

finger  to  nose  to  examiner’s  finger,  thumb  to  forefinger  tap,  and  Romberg  test  were  used  to  exclude  sub­

jects  with  neurological  soft  signs  that  may  be  associated  with  frontal  lobe  cognitive  deficits  (Thienemann 

and Koran  1995). Medical  conditions likely  to effect  mood and  cognition, such  as metabolic  disorders, men­

tal  retardation,  untreated  endocrine  disorders,  and  pregnancy,  precluded  entry  into  the  study.  Subjects  us­

ing  any  cannabis,  cocaine,  heroin,  or  nonprescription  amphetamines  within  6  months  of  beginning  drug  tri­

als were excluded. Subjects taking tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine, or bupropion within 3 months of

### MODAFINIL FOR ADHD

starting  the  study  or  prescription  stimulants  within  2  weeks  prior  to  the  beginning  of  the  study  were  not  in­ cluded  because  the  efficacy  of  these  drugs  for  ADHD  symptoms  (Wilens  et  al.  1995)  would  make  the  in­ terpretation  of  our  results  more  difficult.  Twenty-nine  people  were  considered  for  this  study,  and  of  these, 22  met  the  criteria  and  were  enrolled.  Four  people  were  excluded  because  they  did  not  meet  DSM-IV  cri­ teria  for  ADHD,  two  because  of  illicit  substance  use,  and  one  because  of  remote  head  injury  and  neuro­ logic  soft  signs  on  exam.  The  subjects  were  screened  for  other  DSM-IV  psychiatric  diagnoses  by  history taking,  consultation  of  medical  records,  and  the  use  of  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory  (Beck  1970)  and  the Hamilton  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (Clark  1994).  Family  histories  were  obtained  including  an  inquiry  of  psy­ chiatric diagnoses, medications prescribed, and prior hospitalizations.

Procedure

The study  design included  three randomized,  2-week drug  treatment phases  of placebo,  modafinil, and  d-

amphetamine, separated by 4-day  washout periods between phases  to minimize carryover effects o f the pre­

vious medication (Fig. 1).  The rationale for the  relatively brief treatment phases  was because of the  rapid on­

set and short duration of action of d-amphetamine and probably modafinil (about 10 h, based on an open-label 

modafinil  feasibility  study  on  two  ADHD  patients  prior  to  this  study—unpublished  data).  Subjects  received 

drugs  or  placebo  in  unmarked  capsules,  which  contained  lactose,  50  mg  of  modafinil,  or  5  mg  of 

d-amphetamine. Throughout, a pharmacy prepared, distributed, and tracked all the drugs separately from raters 

and subjects in order t o maintain double-blind conditions.  Daily dosing was on awakening and  again 5 h later. 

Each drug  phase began  with one  capsule twice  daily and  was increased  by an  additional capsule  twice daily 

every 1  to 2  days as  tolerated up  to four  capsules per  dose (a  maximum of  eight capsules  a day  of placebo, 

400 mg of  modafinil, or 40  mg of d-amphetamine).  At each dosage  interval, the clinician  (F.T.) consulted with 

the subjects by phone to check on progress and for side effects. The phone checks occurred at least five times 

during each of the three drug phases. The subjects met with the clinician  at least three times during each drug 

phase: (a) before beginning the drug, (b) when  an optimum dose was reached, and (c) on the last day of  each 

trial when  ratings and  tests were  done. An  optimum daily  dosage was  one in  which the  benefits outweighed 

the side effects and  was decided by consensus of the  subject and the clinician. This d ose was selected within 

4 to 7 days, and treatment at that fixed dose was maintained for another 7 to 10 days.

Measures

Rating scales and  cognitive testing were  done at the  clinic on four  occasions: before beginning  drug treat­

ment (baseline)  and on  the last  day of  each drug  treatment phase  within 3  h of  the last  dose. Baseline  as­

ments.  At  baseline,  family  history  and  demographic  data  were  collected.  For  a  subject  to  be  considered  to have  a  family  history  of  ADHD,  the  relatives  in  question  had  to  have  been  diagnosed  with  the  disorder. The  subjects  were  screened  for  current  and  past  psychiatric  diagnoses  meeting  DSM-IV  criteria.  This  in­ cluded  inquiry  as  to  present  symptoms,  past  diagnoses,  hospitalizations,  and  medications.  For  assessing change during  treatment, we  used three  rating scales:  one scale  for ADHD  and one  each for  depression and 

anxiety.  The  self-rated  ADHD  Behavior  Checklist  for  Adults  is  a  severity  rating  scale  specifically  designed for adults  over 18  (described above).  The other  two scales  were the  self-rated 21-item  Beck Depression  In­ ventory,  with  a  maximum  score  of  63  (Beck  1970),  and  the  clinician-administered  14-item  Hamilton  Anx­ iety  Rating  Scale,  with  a  maximum  score  of  56  (Clark  1994).  The  latter  two  scales  were  used  to  look  for drug  effects  on  mood  that  could  influence  the  results  of  the  ADHD  scales.  On  the  last  visit  of  each  drug trial,  as  part  of  the  clinician  review  of  the  subject’s  status,  a  17-item  checklist  was  completed  to  screen  for the  typical  stimulant  side  effects,  such  as  irritatibility,  appetite  suppression,  insomnia,  and  rebound  effects between doses or between drug trials (Barkley and Murphy 1998).

Three  tests  of  cognitive  functioning  were  administered  by  the  clinician  (F.T.).  The  version  using  the  let­

ters  C,  F,  and  L  of  the  Controlled  Oral  Word  Association  Test  (COWAT)  was  used  to  measure  verbal  flu­

ency,  task  persistence,  and  divided  attention  (Benton  and  Hamshire  1989).  There  is  one  trial  for  each  let­

ter  (C.  F,  and  L),  and  the  task  is  to  say  as  many  words  as  possible  in  1  minute  that  begin  with  the  letter. 

Rules  about  not  using  proper  nouns  and  the  same  root  word  are  explained  to  the  subject.  The  Wechsler 

Adult  Intelligence  Scale-Revised  digit  span  subtests  (forwards  and  backwards)  were  used  to  assess  work­

ing  memory  and  concentration  abilities  (Kovner  et  al. 1 998). The  task  is  to  repeat,  after  the  examiner, su c­ cessively  longer  strings  of  numbers  without  mistakes.  The  Stroop  Color-Word  Interference  Test  was  used 

as a measure  of focused  (undivided) attention  (Golden 1976). The  Stroop tests  the rapidity of  correctly read­

ing  aloud  the  colors  on  each  of  three  lists.  The  first  is  a  list  of  words  (colors)  written  in  black  ink,  next  a 

list  of  colored  bars,  and  last  a  list  of  words  (colors)  written  in  the  wrong  color  ink.  The  test  is  scored  ac­

cording to the number of correct responses given in 45 sec.

Statistical analysis

To  compare  the  effects  of  modafinil  to  d-amphetamine  and  placebo  for  ADHD  treatment,  repeated  mea­

sures  analyses  of  variance  (ANOVAs)  were  performed.  There  were  no  violations  of  assumptions  of  the  re­

peated measures  ANOVAs in  any analysis.  An intent-to-treat  design was  used where  the baseline  score was 

carried  forward  for  the si ngle  patient w ithout  complete  data.  In t he case  of a  significant drug effect,  planned 

comparisons between the  drug and placebo  groups were conducted  using a pooled  error term. To  reduce the 

probability  of  type  I  errors,  a  Bonferroni  correction  to  the p  values  was  used  for  each  study  measure.  This 

====resulted  in  a  significance  level  of  0.002.  Although  only  tests  with ====p====  values  of  0.002  or  less  are  considered 

====statistically significant, the other ====p==== values and significance are included for descriptive purposes only.

====Prior  to  these  analyses,  we  used  paired ====t====  tests  to  determine  if  the  placebo  means  differed  from  baseline 

====means,  and  there  were  no  statistical  differences  on  any  measure.  Prior  to  analyses,  we  also  tested  for  se­

====quence (carryover effects) and period  (repeated administration o r practice) effects.  Sequence was tested  us­

====ing the  sequence of  drug treatments  as the  between-groups factors  in repeated  measures ANOVAs.  To test 

for period  effect,  repeated measures  ANOVAs were performed  where the  repeated measures  were the  first, 

second, and  third administration  of the  measures regardless  of treatment.  There were no  sequence or period 

effects (p < 0.01).  Treatment response  scores were  the change  scores between  placebo and  the drug  con­

dition  on  the  DSM-IV  ADHD  Behavior  Checklist  for  Adults.  Drug  treatment  responses  were  correlated 

with  the  final  drug  dose  as  a  check  on  how  effectively  true  optimum  drug  levels  were  achieved.  There 

should  be  little  correlation  if  optimum  dosing  was  indeed  accomplished.  Treatment  responses to b oth d rugs 

were  correlated  with  each  other,  with  the  total  number  of  side  effects,  and  with  baseline  scores.  In  other 

drug trials  of ADHD  adults, a  favorable response  to drug  treatment has  been defined  as a  30% or  more re­

duction  of  ADHD  symptoms  (Spencer  et  al.  1998).  Using  this  standard,  a  McNemar’s  test  was  used  to  de­

termine  if  the  number  of  subjects  with  a  “favorable  response”  differed  between  the  two  drug  treatments. 

Lastly, McNemar’s  tests for  correlated proportions  were used  to determine  if the  percentages of  patients re­

porting specific side effects differed depending on active drug or placebo.

### MODAFINIL FOR ADHD

Inventory or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale.

### **RESULTS**

The  22  patients  averaged  40.8  years  of  age  (SD  =  12.5)  with  a  median  age  of  43  and  a  range  from  18 

to 59.  Nine of  the patients  were women  (41%), and  13 (59%)  were men.  All patients  had a  high school  ed­

ucation,  and  12  (55%)  had  completed  college.  Fifteen  (75%)  required  tutoring  by  the  12th  grade.  All  but  2 

(9%)  subjects  (adopted)  had  a  family  history  of  ADHD,  and  16  (73%)  of  these  had  at  least  one  child  or 

sibling  with  the  disorder.  Eleven  (50%)  subjects  were  of  the  inattentive  ADHD  subtype,  9  (41%)  were  of the  mixed  ADHD  type,  and  2  (9%)  were  of  the  hyperactive-impulsive  ADHD  subtype.  The  mean  baseline Hamilton anxiet y score  was 11.4  (SD =  7.0) and  ranged from  3 to  27. The  mean baseline  Beck Depression 

Inventory  Score  was  11.9  (SD  =  9.3),  with  a  range  of  0  to  33.  Prior  to  this  study,  1  (5%)  subject  had  prior treatment  with  one  stimulant  and 4  (18%) had  two prior  stimulant tria ls. Eleven  (41%) had  at least  one life ­ time  comorbid  axis  I  disorder,  but  only  one  (5%)  had  current  ratings  of  both  depression  and  anxiety  that 

were  severe.  The  most  common  comorbidities  were  as  follows:  10  (46%)  subjects  had  at  least  one  prior episode of  depression, and  3 (14%)  subjects had  both generalized  anxiety disorder  and a  past history  of al­ cohol dependence.  One subject  (5%) was  dropped from  the study  after enrollment  but before  drug trials  be­ gan due to an emergent hyperthyroid condition.

The  mean  ±  SD  daily  doses  of  modafinil  and  d-amphetamine  were  206.8  ±  84.9  mg  and  21.8  ±  8.9  mg, respectively. With  respect to  baseline measures,  there were  no significant  differences between  baseline and placebo scores  for any  scales or  cognitive tests.  Tables 1  and 2  depict the  averaged data  collected at  base­ line and  at the  end of  each treatment  phase. Sequence  effects and  Sequence X  Treatment effects  were ex­ amined for  all measures,  and none  was significant.  There were  also no  significant period  effects. Therefore, sequence  or  period  effects  did  not  bias  the  following  analyses.  Table  1  shows  that,  using  planned  ANOVA comparisons,  modafinil  and  d-amphetamine  treatments  resulted  in  a  significant  reduction  of  ADHD  symp­ toms  by  the  DSM-IV  ADHD  scale  in  comparison  to  the  placebo  condition (p  <  0.001).  On  average,  pa­ tients  had  less  severe  ADHD  symptoms  during  the  modafinil  trial  compared  to  the  d-amphetamine  trial,  but these differences were not statistically significant.

Table  2  depicts  the  results  of  cognitive  testing,  which  were  in  the  direction  of  improvement  but  did  not reach  statistical  significance.  However,  performance  on  the  COW  AT  trended  toward  significance  during both  active  drug  conditions (p  =  0.02).  With  respect  to  the  mood  scores,  there  were  no  significant  differ­ ences between  placebo and  either active  drug treatment.  With respect  to the  mood scales,  analyses showed that  there  were  no  differences  between  active  drug  and  placebo  conditions  for  either  the  Beck  Depression 

In  other  medication  response  studies,  a  30%  or  more  reduction  in  ADHD  symptom  measures  is  consid­ ====ered  a  favorable  response  to  medication.  Ten  (48%)  subjects  had  a  favorable  response  to  d-amphetamine ====and 10  (48%) to  modafinil. Six  (29%) subjects  had a  favorable response  to both  drugs, 4  (19%) to  modafinil ====alone,  4  (19%)  to  d-amphetamine  alone,  and  7  (33%)  to  neither  drug.  There  was  no  association  between ====favorable  treatment  response  to  the  two  drugs  (McNemar  %====2====  =  0).  Also,  on  the  DSM-IV  ADHD  measure, 

====there were no significant correlations  between responses t o either drug  condition and the  final drug dosages, 

====number of side effects on that drug, baseline ADHD scores, or retrospective childhood ADHD scores.

====At  the e nd o f t he stu dy,  before  unblinding, subjects  were asked their  opinion about  which medication  re­

sulted  in  the  best  improvement  of  their  symptoms.  Nine  (43%)  subjects  chose  modafinil,  and  five  (24%)  of 

these  subjects  were  of  the  inattentive  ADHD  subtype.  Ten  (48%)  subjects  chose  d-amphetamine,  and  six 

(29%)  of  these  subjects  were  of  the  inattentive  ADHD  subtype.  Two  (10%)  subjects  chose  placebo.  After 

unblinding,  11  (52%)  subjects  elected  to  continue  long-term  treatment  with  modafinil,  and  10  (48%)  sub­ jects chose d-amphetamine.

Table  3  presents  the  adverse  effects  reported  by  subjects.  Insomnia,  irritability,  muscle  tension,  and  ap­

petite  suppression  were  the  most  common  adverse  effects.  The  rebound  effects  occurred  in  the  evenings 

and  were  between  30  min  and  1  h  in  duration.  No  rebound  effects  were  reported  during  the  drug  washout 

periods.  All  three  subjects  who  developed  transient  lingual  dyskinesia  reported  that  the  condition  resolved 

when  the  drug  dose  was  lowered.  McNemar’s  tests  showed  no  significant  differences  in  the  prevalence  of 

side effects between the active drugs and placebo conditions.

**DISCUSSION**

Treatment  with  modafinil  was  effective  and  well  tolerated  in  this  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-con­ trolled,  crossover  study  of  21  adults  with  ADHD.  The  effective  dose  of  modafinil  in  this  study  (206.8 mg/day)  was  within  the  range  of  effective  dosing  for  the  treatment  of  narcolepsy  (US  Modafinil  in  Nar­ colepsy  Study  Group  1998).  Although  this  was  a  crossover  study  of  short  duration,  the  magnitude  of  im­ provement  in  ADHD  symptoms  after  modafinil  treatment  was  comparable  to  the  magnitude  of  improve­ ment  following  treatment  with  d-amphetamine. The  48% fa vorable  response r ate t o t reatment  with m odafinil was  similar  to  that  reported  in  studies  of  the  typical  stimulants  for  the  treatment  of  ADHD  in  adults  (54%) (Wilens  et  al. 1 995). No  subjects discontinued treatment with  either modafinil  or d-amphetamine. These  re­ sults  support  the  hypothesis  that  modafinil  may  be  a  viable  treatment  for  ADHD  in  adults.  The  viability  of modafinil  is  also  supported  by  a  trend  level  improvement  of  the  COW  AT,  which  tests  for  verbal  fluency, task persistence,  and divided  attention. The  optimum dosages  of modafinil  appeared to  vary widely  between individuals (mean = 206.8mg/day, SC = 84.9 mg/day).

There  was  no  correlation  between  the  severity  of  childhood  or  baseline  ADHD  symptoms  and  the  re­ duction  of  ADHD  symptoms.  It  is  possible  that  there  were  other  predictors  of  drug  response  that  masked the  usual  correlation  of  illness  severity  to  the  degree  of  drug  response  phenomenon.  There  was  no  signifi­ ====cant  correlation  between t he r eduction  of  ADHD  symptoms f rom  one dr ug to th e oth er, wh ich su ggests  that ====the mechanism of action of the two drugs may be different.

====The  pharmacologic  mechanisms  underlying  the  apparent  beneficial  actions  of  modafinil  in  ADHD  are  of ====interest.  Recent  animal  studies  suggest  that  modafinil's  action  is  quite  selective  for  the  hypothalamus  and ====tuberomamillary nucleus  (TMN) (Chemelli  et al.  1999; Eastbrooke  et al.  1999). Preclinical  data also  suggest ====that, unlike  amphetamine stimulants,  modafinil produces  arousal through  a mechanism  that does  not appear ====to involve  enhanced dopaminergic  activity (Ferraro  et al.  1997). Instead  modafinil may  activate hypothalamic and TMN  arousal pathways  involving hypocretin  neurons from  the lateral  hypothalamus and/or  histaminergic neurons  from  the  TMN  that  have  exitatory  projections  including  heavy  innervation  to  the  frontal  cortex (Chemelli  et  al.  1999).  These  findings  are  especially  interesting  in  light  of  the  important  role  that  hypofunctionality  of  the  prefrontal  cortex  and  diminished  executive  functioning  may  play  in  the  etiology  of  ADHD (Castellanos 1997). Whether modafinil is indeed efficacious for ADHD by these mechanisms is undetermined.

These findi ngs should  be considered  in light  of some  methodological limitations.  The short  (2 weeks)  ex­ posure  to  medications  and  4-day  washout  periods  between  trials  may  have  been  too  brief  to  examine  the therapeutic effect  of modafinil  fully. Despite  the short  duration of  the drug  trials, our  statistical analyses  sug­ gest that our  results are not  biased by sequence  or by the  period of drug  administration. This is  probably be­ cause prior  studies indicate  that both  d-amphetamine and  modafinil have  a rapid  onset of  action and  a short duration of action of 12 h or less (US Modafinil in Narcolepsy Study Group 1998; Wilens et al. 1995).

These results suggest that modafinil, with low abuse potential, may be a well-tolerated treatment option
