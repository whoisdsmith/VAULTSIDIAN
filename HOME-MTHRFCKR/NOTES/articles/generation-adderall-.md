ADHD: Is there an “epidemic”? o NYT Article: “The Selling of Attention Deficit 

### Disorder” Dec 2013 • Discussed concern over rapid increase in ADHD 

<sup>diagnoses and stimulant prescriptions • Focused particularly on the role of pharmaceutical</sup> 

<sup>advertising • From Dr. Keith Conners (creator of the Conners</sup> 

<sup>ADHD rating scale): “The numbers make it look like an epidemic. Well, it’s not.</sup> 

<sup>It’s preposterous. This is a concoction to justify the giving out of medication at unprecedented and unjustifiable levels.”</sup>

Epidemiology o Estimated natural prevalence of ADHD:

### <sup>• 3-5% of children</sup>

<sup>• 2.5-4.4% of adults o But...</sup>

<sup>• Surveys indicate 11% of 4-17 year olds had been</sup> 

<sup>diagnosed with ADHD as of 2011</sup>

<sup>• Rates of diagnoses increased 5% per year between</sup> 

<sup>2003-2011</sup>

There’s a pill for that... o Sales of prescription stimulants have increased 

### from $1.7 billion to $9 billion in the past decade

o There were 16 million prescriptions written for 

adults ages 20-39 in 2012, triple the amount 

written in 2007

College students: the next generation? • Rates of ADHD in college students estimated at 

### 5% based on surveys of incoming freshmen • Rates of diagnosis during college difficult to 

determine, but is not inconsequential • Significant overlap between ADHD symptoms 

and normal traits • In one study of students self-referred for ADHD 

evaluation, 25-48% exaggerated symptoms

A Dangerous Trend? o NYT Article: Drowned in a Stream of

### Prescriptions (Feb 2013) • Story of 24-year old Richard Fee, a honors college 

<sup>graduate started on stimulants after a brief initial</sup> 

<sup>assessment and diagnosis of ADHD after having never had symptoms • Details his 2-year history of escalating use, functional</sup> 

<sup>decline, psychotic symptoms, and ultimate suicide • From on of Richard’s prescribers: “He didn’t seem like</sup> 

<sup>he was a drug person at all, but rather a person that was misunderstood, really desirous of becoming a</sup> 

<sup>physician. He was very slick and smooth. He convinced me there was a benefit.”</sup>

Not Just College... o A 2010 study of a large public medical school

prescription use of prescription stimulants o 70% of these students reported obtaining 

medications from their peers o Most common motivations for use were increased 

alertness for studying and improved academic 

performance

Who misuses stimulants? o Hartung et al. 2013 study of students at 4 universities: • Misusers more likely to stay awake, to study, and for

Who provides them? o Desantis et al. 2013 study of 2,139 undergraduates:

### <sup>• Of students with stimulant prescription, 52.5% had</sup> 

<sup>given pills away, 39.2% had sold them</sup>

<sup>• Distribution was predicted by: gender (men>women),</sup> 

<sup>sorority/fraternity membership, overestimation of</sup> 

<sup>perceived stimulant use by others, use of ETOH, MJ,</sup> 

<sup>hallucinogens, painkillers</sup>

<sup>• No significant differences across GPA or majors o Students with stimulant prescriptions were more likely to</sup> 

<sup>be approached to sell/give/trade their meds than those with</sup> 

<sup>prescriptions for opiates, benzos, or sleeping pills</sup>

Different groups with overlap

•  Those with clear ADHD. •  Those with some ADHD symptoms and disturbance in 

academic performance. •  Those who use stimulants as cognitive enhancers for 

studying/exams/writing papers/etc. •  Those who use stimulants recreationally.

Arguments against cognitive enhancers

It’s cheating. They’re illegal. Indirect coercion. They are dangerous. What does it mean regarding learning? What is the value we are seeking? Does product change 

after stimulant use in this way?


---

###### Page 36

![GenerationAdderall__36_7](Generated/images/GenerationAdderall__36_7.png)

Arguments for...

•  Could prevention of neuroenhancement be enforced? 

Prohibition is likely to fail. •  Limiting autonomy? •  Should we limit people from working longer hours, 

being more focused, etc? •  Inequalities already exist. •  People use caffeine, nicotine, etc, already.

###### Page 37

![GenerationAdderall__37_7](Generated/images/GenerationAdderall__37_7.png)

Arguments for...

•  Cosmetic neurology vs. cosmetic surgery vs. vs. shift 

work treatments vs. sleep aids vs. sexual dysfunction 

treatments vs. general medical treatments. •  Could they actually be used to decrease inequalities? •  At least a working relationship with them would exist if 

we gave stimulants to them.


---

###### Page 38

![GenerationAdderall__38_7](Generated/images/GenerationAdderall__38_7.png)

What do we do?

Systems-based interventions to optimize performance, 

attention, reduce perceived need for non-medical

stimulant use, and value learning?

Could these same interventions decrease mood and 

anxiety disorders and substance misuse as well?
