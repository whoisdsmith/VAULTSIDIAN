This Entry is Addressed to All Three of My Children

Since my Dad (Your Grandpa Johnnie) died back in February of this year, I’ve been trying to get my life in order so that if anything happens to me, you all will have access to everything that was my life.

I really haven’t had my shit together since my divorce.

I fell apart for 3 straight years and in those 3 years I made a lot of bad decisions, I took that heartbreak out on temporary solutions and sometimes or maybe a lot of times, neglected giving all 3 of you the love and attention you deserve.

Just know that is all on me and I take full accountability for it. So please do not grow up believing and thinking that you did anything wrong or that I didn’t care or love you. You 3 are my whole heart and the center of which the world to me pivots on.

In life we make mistakes, we fuck up and than we fuck up some more. What’s important is that we learn from those mistakes and correct our actions and behavior because of those mistakes.

You’re going to have good days and you’re going to have bad days, really bad days and “it’s the end of the fucking world” bad days. The good news is, those days don’t last long and they don’t come around often or at least they shouldn’t.

Life is about living and dreaming and finding out who you are. Do your best to be open minded and kind and caring. Things are going to happen to you that will not be your fault, things that will be out of your control and things that will make you feel shit you never knew existed. Don’t let those things or those people turn your hearts of Gold into Stone. Don’t become the things that hurt you.

Most important, don’t make the same mistakes I have. Don’t be anything like me.

I love you.

Dad.
