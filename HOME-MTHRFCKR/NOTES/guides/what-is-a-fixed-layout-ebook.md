## Are you uncertain about the difference between a fixed layout eBook and a standard (“flowable”) eBook?

There are the two types of eBook formatting: Standard eBooks and Fixed Layout eBooks.

1. **Standard eBooks (ePub and .mobi)** feature a dynamic (“flowable”) layout for text and images. This means that your eBook will look different when viewed on different eReaders.
2. **Fixed Layout** eBooks quite literally “affix“ images and text to exact spots on each electronic page – just like their printed book counterparts — so that they look the same, regardless of which reader you use.

### Does your eBook need a Fixed Layout?

Most eBooks do not require a Fixed Layout file and are only needed when it’s important that the images and text appear in a specific and consistent way.

These books are usually good candidates:

- Illustrated children’s books
- Cookbooks
- Coffee table books
- Graphic novels
- Textbooks and technical manuals
- …and any book that relies on a heavily-designed, static presentation, full-page images, or text that overlaps with images.
