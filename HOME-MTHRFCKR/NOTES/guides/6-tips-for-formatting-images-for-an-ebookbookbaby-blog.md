## If a picture’s worth a thousand words, correctly formatted images for an eBook can be priceless

We often get inquiries about image formatting, so here are a few tips to make sure the images you are using for your eBook are eReader ready.

**1\. Avoid wrapping text around images**. Use in-line images with text above and below for best results.

**2.Include that same text description of your picture below the image** to make your images/pictures searchable.

**3\. Cover graphics should be at least 1400px wide,** portrait or vertical rectangle-shaped artwork (no squares). We recommend a height/width ratio of 1.5 (1400px wide x 2100px tall). Your images should be 300 dpi/ppi (only in .jpg format).

**4\. Full-page images should be a minimum of 300 dpi/ppi,** which equals a resolution of 600px wide x 800px tall on a letter-sized page. Logos or simple images: 75 – 100 pixels tall.

**5. Don’t worry too much about the exact size of images within your document.** The best approach is to size it how you want it to appear in relation to the text.

**6\. All images must be RGB only and 300 dpi** (CMYK images are not accepted by our retail partners).

Other important tips of note when it comes to images are:

### Image conversion

[BookBaby can convert](http://www.bookbaby.com/services/ebookconversion) all of the graphic elements included in your eBook (and will convert up to 10 graphic elements for free on each eBook submission).

### Images, tables, and diagrams

Images, tables, and diagrams require optimization to ensure proper display on the supported eReaders. Non-image materials such as excel tables, pie charts, and non-flattened artwork will be converted to jpegs for proper display on eReaders. These items will not scale or resize with the fonts.

### Digital cameras pictures

When you take a photograph with a digital camera or scan an image using a digital scanner, the resulting file uses the RGB color mode so you will not need to convert these files.

### Photoshop and color mode

If you are using Adobe Photoshop and want to check the color mode of your file, you can do so under Image > Mode. We suggest making any necessary color mode conversions from CMYK to RGB before you start color/tonal changes or photo manipulation.
