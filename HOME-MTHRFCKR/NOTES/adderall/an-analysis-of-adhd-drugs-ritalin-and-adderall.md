#### INTRODUCTION

```
Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is a psychiatric condition that is treated with a
class of drugs called psychostimulants whose major function is to increase activity of the central
nervous system (CNS). The main region of exertion is the dopamine transporter (DAT) in the
brain. Psychostimulants have been found to be the most effective drugs in reducing symptoms of
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in patients with ADHD [1]. To gain an understanding
of ADHD drugs, this paper will provide an overview of two commonly prescribed drugs:
Adderall (dextroamphetamines) and Ritalin (methylphenidate), with emphasis on the chemical
and physical properties, chemical structure, mode of action, dosage, and adverse effects.
PART I: CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
Ritalin
The brand name Ritalin is made up of the chemical compound Methylphenidate (MPH)
with the IUPAC (abbreviation from the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry)
name methyl phenyl(piperidin-2-yl)acetate [2]. The molecular formula for MPH, C 14 H 19 NO 2 and
structural formula (pictured below) indicate that the chemical compound consists of the elements
carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen with a molecular weight totaling to 233.31 g/mol. MPH is a
piperidine compound due to the presence of an amine group bonded within a carbon cycle. The
melting point of this compound is 214 °C [2]. The finished product that makes up MPH is an
odorless, white solid as crystalline powder [3].

Methylphenidate
Adderall
The brand name Adderall is a chemical compound that is made up of powerful blends of
the amphetamine (abbreviated form from alpha-methylphenethyl amine) salts
dextroamphetamine and levoamphetamine, which are isomers of the original amphetamine
molecule and come in a 3:1 ratio [4]. The blend consists of the following:
One-quarter racemic (d,l-)amphetamine aspartate monohydrate,
One-quarter dextroamphetamine saccharin,
One-quarter dextroamphetamine sulfate,
One-quarter racemic (d,l-)amphetamine sulfate [5].
The IUPAC name for dextroamphetamine is 1-phenylpropan-2-amine [5]. The molecular
formula, C 9 H 13 N and structural formula (pictured below) show that the compound consists of the
elements carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen with a molecular weight totaling to 135.21 g/mol. The

chemical structure also reveals a benzene aromatic ring bonded with an amine side group. Before
amphetamine is made into a salt or a solid for ingestion, it is a colorless liquid with a boiling
point of 203-204 °C [6].
Amphetamine
PART II: MODE OF ACTION
Dopamine
The biggest player in improving symptoms of ADHD is a catecholamine neurotransmitter
called dopamine. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with two attached hydroxyl side
groups (see picture below). Studies suggest that a person with ADHD has a dopamine
dysfunction and lacks the normal levels of the neurotransmitter [7]. Dopamine is biosynthesized
in the body through an enzyme catalyzed process in which substrates are converted to more
complex products [7,8]. Furthermore, dopamine is a precursor for the neurotransmitters
norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and then epinephrine (adrenaline) in their biosynthetic pathways.
This family of catecholamines is biosynthesized by nervous tissue and the adrenal gland [7].
After synthesis, dopamine is packaged into vesicles which are then released into the synapse in
response to a presynaptic action potential. In the nervous system, a synapse is a structure that
permits a neuron (nerve cell) to pass an electrical or chemical signal to another cell [9] via axons.
Action potentials generate and travel along axons of neurons to activate synaptic connections

between each other. Regulation of neurotransmitters such as dopamine is achieved through cell-
cell signaling via synapses. At a chemical synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter
molecules into a small space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. These
molecules then bind to the receptors on the receiving cells side of the synaptic cleft to the post
synaptic area. Finally, the neurotransmitters must be cleared out of the pre synaptic area
efficiently in order to be prepared for succeeding signals [10]. The dopaminergic neuron
dopamine modulates both pre and post synaptic neurotransmission [7]. It is naturally released in
rewarding experiences. Moreover, dopamine has many functions of regulation in the brain
including cognition, voluntary movement, motivation, punishment, sleep, mood, attention,
working memory, and learning [10]. For example, an individual affected with Parkinson’s
disease experiences dysfunctions in their motor and cognition because the dopamine generating
cells no longer operate appropriately. Dopamine neurotransmitter plays a crucial role in the
ability of a person to function and perform all essential daily activities. A synthetic form of
dopamine has been made, however ingesting the synthesized dopamine drug has no direct affect
to the CNS (central nervous system) because it cannot pass the blood brain barrier (BBB). For
this reason, chemical compounds that are smaller molecules such as MPH and amphetamines are
medically used to increase levels of dopamine and related neurotransmitters in the brain.

Dopamine
Ritalin
MPH is a chain substituted amphetamine derivative that primarily acts as a
norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor [2]. It is well absorbed from the gastro-intestinal
(GI) tract after oral administration and reaches peak concentrations in the brain within
approximately 2 hours [11, 12]. MPH targets the dopamine transporter (DAT) with the affected
area being the prefrontal cortex in the brain [13]. The main mechanism of action is the
modulation of the catecholamines, norepinephrine and dopamine. This is achieved by the
enantiomers d-threo-methylphenidate and l-threo-methylphenidate which bind to DAT [14]. A
norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor increases the amount of norepinephrine and
dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain by partially blocking DAT, inhibiting it from completely
removing the dopamine from the synapse [2]. Generally, the inhibition of DAT stops the
presynaptic neuron from reabsorbing dopamine and norepinephrine, which increases the amount
of dopamine in the synapse. Persons affected by ADHD tend to have lower levels of dopamine
neurotransmitters in their synapses and the inhibition of DAT during treatment stimulates the

```
release of dopamine and norepinephrine into the synapse. MPH has the capability to occupy
about 50% of the dopamine transporters [2]. Because MPH is a small molecule, it passes through
the BBB in the mode similar to those of cocaine, but the MPH is less intoxicating and its
duration of action is longer. Stimulation of dopaminergic activity greatly increases levels of
dopamine, which ultimately increases attention and motivation, while decreasing distractibility
and motor hyperactivity [13].
Adderall
Adderall is administrated orally and absorbed from the GI (gastrointestinal) tract with
peak concentration in the brain reached approximately in 3 hours [15]. During its metabolic
process, the aromatic ring in amphetamine oxidizes to form alpha-hydroxyamphetamine, which
then undergoes deamination to form phenylacetone, and finally, oxidizes to form benzoic acid
[15]. Similar to MPH and cocaine, amphetamine is a small molecule allowing it to pass the BBB
easily. Dextroamphetamine affects the central nervous system by increasing dopamine levels
while levoamphetamine affects the peripheral nervous system by increasing norepinephrine [16].
Since dextroamphetamine consists of three quarters of the salts in Adderall, it greatly impacts the
prefrontal cortex of the brain. In reducing ADHD symptoms, the key function of Adderall is to
block the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin into the presynaptic neuron and
increase the release of these monoamines into the synaptic space [15]. Like MPH, it is able to
enhance dopaminergic activity by binding to DAT and prolonging the availability of
neurotransmitters in the synapse by slowing down their removal [16]. Additionally,
amphetamine enters the presynaptic neuron building a membrane potential to force dopamine
molecules out of their storage vesicles and expel them into the synaptic space. This action is
performed by making the dopamine transporters work in reverse [7]. Subsequently, amphetamine

also has the power to inhibit the enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of
neurotransmitters called monoamine oxidase [16]. Inhibiting this process leads to the
accumulation of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The potency of dextroamphetamine in
Adderall greatly and rapidly increases levels of the monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapse,
ultimately reducing symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.
PART III: DOSAGE AND ADVERSE EFFECTS
Ritalin
MPH is available in immediate release form (Ritalin), sustained release form (Ritalin
SR), and extended release form (Ritalin LA). The immediate release form is available as 5 mg,
10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg tablets and can last anywhere from 3 to 5 hours [17, 18]. The
immediate release tablet is taken two to three times daily with an average dosage of 20 to 30 mg
a day [17]. The recommended starting dosage is 5 mg and is adjusted based on the response of
the individual [17]. Ritalin SR is available as 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg and is taken once or
twice daily. Ritalin LA is available as 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, and 50 mg capsules [17]. Ritalin LA
is taken once daily in the morning and can last anywhere from 8 to 12 hours [17, 18]. All forms
of MPH are not recommended to exceed 60 mg per day [19]. The dosage prescribed to a patient
is determined by their severity of symptoms, body weight, and rate of metabolism. The common
adverse effects associated with taking MPH are rapid heart rate, palpitations, nervousness,
restlessness, insomnia, dry mouth, constipation, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, weight loss,
and elevation of blood pressure [17]. MPH should not be used in children under six years old nor
in persons with high blood pressure or any form of heart disease, persons who are nervous or
have severe insomnia, persons who are taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors and persons who
have a history of addiction to drugs and alcohol [20]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
7

```
also issues an additional “Black Box” warning label which means that medical studies indicate
these drugs carry a significant risk of serious, or even life-threatening, adverse effects [20].
Ritalin is classified as a schedule II substance by the FDA because it shares the same abuse
potential as cocaine and morphine that may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence
[20]. There is little research on the long term effects of using MPH. It is possible to build up a
tolerance where the person using the drug will need to take larger doses to achieve the same
effect [20]. Overtime, the body may become dependent on the drug to function normally. The
withdrawal symptoms that could arise include tiredness, panic attacks, crankiness, extreme
hunger, depression and nightmares. These symptoms are mostly psychological and stopping the
drug suddenly can cause extreme fatigue and severe, even suicidal, depression in adult patients
[20]. A person should never stop taking MPH abruptly but should do so gradually.
Adderall
Adderall is available in instant (Adderall IR) and extended release form (Adderall XR).
The instant release tablet is taken 2 to 3 times daily; 4 to 6 hours apart each time, and can be
taken with or without food [21]. The doses available for Adderall IR tablets are 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10
mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg breakable tablets. The daily maximum recommended dose is 40
mg, but some patients may initially require 60 mg [22]. In contrast, Adderall XR is taken only
once daily in the morning and can be taken with or without food [21]. The doses available for
Adderall XR capsules are 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, and 30 mg capsules, which are not
breakable [21]. The daily maximum recommended dose is 30 mg, but some patients may require
more [22]. Adderall IR and XR are both metabolized by the liver; IR lasts 4 – 6 hours and XR
lasts 8 – 10 hours [22]. Patients normally start at a low dose and gradually increase as tolerated.
The most common adverse reactions in children ages 6 to 12 are loss of appetite, insomnia,
8

```
abdominal pain, emotional liability, vomiting, nervousness, nausea, and fever [23]. In
adolescents, the common adverse reactions are loss of appetite, insomnia, abdominal pain,
weight loss, and nervousness [23]. Finally, in adults, the common adverse reactions are dry
mouth, loss of appetite, insomnia, headache, weight loss, nausea, anxiety, agitation, dizziness,
tachycardia, diarrhea, asthenia, and urinary tract infections [23]. Adderall should not be used in
persons who have not tried other psychotherapy before, have high blood pressure or any form of
heart disease, are very nervous or have severe insomnia, have a history of addiction to drugs or
alcohol, take monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or have Tourette syndrome, which is one of several
chronic tic disorders [24]. The FDA also issues a “Black Box” warning label which means that
medical studies indicate these drugs carry a significant risk of serious, or even life-threatening
adverse effects. Like Ritalin, Adderall is also classified as a schedule II drug by the FDA due to
its high abuse potential. Amphetamines have the ability to induce anxiety disorders, psychosis,
and sexual dysfunction [24]. Because amphetamines are very closely related to MPH, they have
the same dependence, tolerance, and withdrawal characteristics. It is possible to build up a
tolerance where the person using the drug will need to take larger doses to achieve the same
effect [24]. Overtime, the body may become dependent on the drug to function normally. The
withdrawal symptoms that could arise include tiredness, panic attacks, crankiness, extreme
hunger, depression and nightmares [24]. These symptoms are psychological and stopping the
drug suddenly can cause extreme fatigue and severe, even suicidal, depression in adult patients
[24]. Again, a person should never stop taking Adderall abruptly but should do so gradually. Jack
M. Gorman, M.D., professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and deputy director of the
New York State Psychiatric Institute emphasizes: “Adderall is a very powerful drug that

undoubtedly works for ADHD, but there are alternatives with less abuse potential that should be
tried first.” [24]
SUMMARY
MPH and Adderall are both used for the pharmacological treatment of ADHD but differ
chemically. Moreover, although the both drugs are similar in structure, metabolism, and clinical
effects, they do differ in their mode of action. MPH is less potent and longer in duration of action
[2]. In contrast, amphetamines have a quicker onset followed by a “speed crash.” Adderall has
the ability to make DAT work in a reverse mechanism increasing catecholamine levels to a
greater and quicker extent than Ritalin. The dosage charts of the two drugs also imply that
Adderall has higher potency. Hence, the maximum recommended dosage for Ritalin is 60 mg
compared to Adderall, which is 40 mg. Although dependency is possible with both Ritalin and
Adderall, the potency of amphetamines in Adderall suggests a higher risk of dependency. It has
greater ability to interfere with the natural mechanism of DAT, causing much lower levels of
dopamine in the absence of the drug [2]. Comparable to cocaine, Ritalin and Adderall are
classified as type II drugs by the FDA because they also have high risks of abuse potential.
Furthermore, resembling cocaine, Ritalin and Adderall are also monoamine reuptake inhibitors
of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The similarities ADHD drugs have to street drugs
such as cocaine gives rise to several controversies. However, Ritalin and Adderall are safe and
effective to use in small doses because studies have proved them to be therapeutic under the
proper regulations. Unfortunately, ADHD drugs are used as recreational stimulants to self-induce
euphoria and can be used as a study aid, social aid or party drug [5]. The effects of long term
usage of Ritalin and Adderall are not clear yet and remain under investigation. Although Ritalin
and Adderall both act to stimulate the nervous system, there are several notable differences

between the two. It is not suggested for one to be better than the other because the effectiveness
of each drug varies from person to person. The drug selected to use for treatment of ADHD
symptoms is determined by a trained physician.
