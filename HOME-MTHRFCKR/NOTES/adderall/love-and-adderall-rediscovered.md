# "Love-and Adderall - Rediscovered"

This is bliss. I am in love, and it has been ages since I had someone I actually looked forward to being with. [Cupid](https://www.additudemag.com/slideshows/adhd-relationship-problems-how-add-can-hurt-couples/) is kind.

We are at the end of month three with Mr. Sensitive, and it’s great. For the first time in my life I can’t complain. (OK, he’s obsessed with baseball, and he wants to take things slow. It took him two months to mention my name to his mother, and to the rest of his family I am non-existent. But, as the father says, as long as I am having fun, that’s all that matters. I mean at the end of the day you can’t care too much, right?)

Mr. Sensitive is an M.D. and knows all about drugs. He’s an anesthesiologist, and, he adds with a laugh, a “drug pusher.” He sometimes talks about his patients in a very generic way, and he has a particular gripe about the “spazes,” the people who can only function pseudo-normally with doses of Clonazepam.

We were flipping through a celeb glossy the other day as we waited for a takeout order, and there was a short piece about Lindsay Lohan. Does she have an [eating disorder or is it the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-linked-to-eating-disorders/) (ADHD) drug [Adderall](https://www.additudemag.com/adderall-adhd-medication-faq/)? Adderall, the secret method of getting skinny to the stars. Mr. Sensitive started going into the details of [Adderall](https://www.additudemag.com/adderall-adhd-medication-faq/)-how it’s a stimulant, how it [suppresses appetite](https://www.additudemag.com/loss-of-appetite-adhd-medication-side-effects/), how it is abused by people, even if they have not been diagnosed with ADHD, who want to shed pounds quickly. “It’s basically speed,” he said to me.

I feel like someone who is now keeping a dark secret. The other day I got a refill of the Adderall, and I’m once again on the medication and feeling oddly productive. Sure I am spending all of my time with Mr. Sensitive, lying in bed, laughing and enjoying the grand view of one of the ritziest neighborhoods in Gotham from the “penthouse.” I feel lucky; everything is going smoothly.

As I write, Mr. Sensitive is sleeping, but I wish I could be myself fully and tell him about “my drugs,” the Adderall, and the long and painful search for answers to my disorganized angst, to the checkerboard resume: 12 jobs in just as many years. Last night he mentioned a few of the things he liked about me. “You’re not crazy and you’re different, I’ve never met anyone like you before,” he says.

“How?” I asked.

“You have this way with words, you say these things and it makes me laugh,” he says.

He says I am sweet, too, and kind. I want to tell him that these are common traits among adults with ADHD, but I stop there. I lie in the darkness and in the silence, and keep my mouth shut.

“Thank you,” is all I say, and it is all that I can reveal for now.
