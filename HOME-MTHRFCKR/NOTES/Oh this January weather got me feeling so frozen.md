# Oh this January weather got me feeling so frozen



Oh this January weather got me feeling so frozen
Got my heart turning cold like it’s 40 below and nobody knows cause I don’t let it show no I don’t 

You woke me from a dead sleep
You always find a way to haunt me in my dreams you always find a way to suffocate me till I can’t breathe, till I’m just a dead man walking

I’ll never forget that night 
you looked me in the eyes
 and said I love you 
as you stabbed me in the chest 
I stood in shock as I bled 
And with my one last breath 
I saw you smile as I was met by death 

Now I’m just a ghost 
Watch me as I float 
through the airwaves unknown
It’s dark and I’m all alone

A broken record composed 
by the one who hurt me the most

stuck in a loop of memories 
and I hope you think of me 
when you come into that frequency, 
every time you hear that familiar sound 
of me hurting so achingly, 

I hope you remember 
that you were the one who killed me 
and there’s no going back, 
you can’t bring the dead back from that, 
I’m trapped in the past and I can’t come back
And that’s a fact cause You made sure of that
