You never really heal from certain traumas. They become a part of you forever. The only hope is that you don’t become the people that hurt you. It’s not fair that they did what they did to you, but it’s more unfair that you cause someone else the same trauma just because it was done to you.

Know the difference, break the cycle or the cycle keeps repeating. Year after year, generation to generation.

We all feel, we all bleed, we all make mistakes. That’s what makes us human. You can’t control what others do to you but you can control what you do to others.

Treat people how you wish you had been treated.

Stay strong, there is always light to be found in the darkness
