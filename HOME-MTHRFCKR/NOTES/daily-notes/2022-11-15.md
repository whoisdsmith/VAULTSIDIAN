Hello!

This report highlights key aspects of your personality based on how you responded to the questionnaire you took earlier.

### Preferences

Are you right or left handed? You “prefer” one hand over the other, in most situations, while still relying a lot on both hands. Similarly, you tend to uphold certain values, communicate in a particular way, find certain activities more energizing, and so forth. Notably, when under stress or by habit, people tend to respond according to preference. Other times, we feel freer to flex.

The good news: the more aware you are of your preferences and options, the more deliberate and adaptable you may be. This report offers you ranked results, to reveal ways to grow.

### Personality

Personality means: “a pattern of preferences.” That is, people don't fit into neat boxes. Nor is a person an arbitrary collection of traits. Rather, each facet of who you are influences the other facets. Altogether, you've learned to function in a way that is sustainable.

While the report touches on various aspects of personality, it focuses on the 16 Myers-Briggs personality types. Each type is presented by a 4-letter code such as ESTJ or INFP. Each of the 16 “types” points to a rich, sustainable pattern.

### Your Personality Type Pattern

What's your personality type? This report can't decide for you! Instead, it provides data points to help you locate your best-fit type.

Ideally, you will enjoy a face-to-face self-discovery process with a professional facilitator to sort through the data points and “triangulate” a best fit. As you explore, look at top-ranked results and also consider lower-ranked results. Your career, upbringing, culture, and such have influenced you and likely explain the ranking.

For example, a person who ranks ESTJ first and ISTJ second likely has a quite a different background than a person who ranks ESTJ first and ENTP second!

### Rich Facets

In addition to the 16 types, this report describes your likely personality preferences in several ways.

- **Temperament:** Your core needs, values, and related talents.
- **Interaction/Social Style:** Your energy, communication, and responsiveness while interacting with others.
- **Cognitive Dynamics:** Your favorite mental processes for where you focus your attention, gather information, organize, and make decisions.

The questionnaire you took earlier tapped all of these models in some way. Each facet has different applications. For example, temperament is useful to find a good career fit while interaction/social styles is a window into better teamwork.

You may be unfamiliar with some of these models. That's okay. Look for the references at the end of this report. Your facilitator can also likely answer your questions.

### Consistency

You will find a consistency score. This score varies from 0 to 10, with 10 as perfectly consistent. A low score is atypical. It means this report is not a good pointer to your personality, for whatever reason, and you should take extra time to explore. In fact, facilitation and exploration are helpful even for medium and high scores. Note: The score isn't about you! Instead, it suggests how much you can trust the results.

### Validity and Reliability

Research is ongoing to improve the questionnaire and report. Presently, 85% of people select the snapshot that corresponds to their best-fit 4-letter personality type code or settle with one of the three types offered to them. Please contact us for more information about this topic.
