Here how to get it from popular browsers and services: [Chrome](https://www.wikihow.com/Export-Bookmarks-from-Chrome), [Safari](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/websites/web-development/export-safari-bookmarks/), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/export-firefox-bookmarks-to-backup-or-transfer), [Pocket](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1015-exporting-your-pocket-list)

##### CSV

We support almost any `CSV` file generated by third-party bookmarking apps.

###### How to Prepare My Own CSV File?

If you want to upload your own CSV file just make sure:

- Comma delimited
- Columns: `url`, `folder`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `created`
- `url` column is required, other are optional
- use `/` to specify nested `folder`, like `a/b/c`
- to have multiple `tags` just put them in quotes, like `"tag1, tag2"`
- `created` column should have Unix timestamp or date in ISO 8601 format
- Column order doesn't matter

Here an example CSV file:

```
folder,url,title,description,tags,created"Folder",http://google.com,Google,"Search engine","search, app",1629980125"Folder/Nested folder",http://yahoo.com,Yahoo,"Another search engine","search, app",1629980125
```

[Validate your CSV](https://csvlint.io/) file before uploading!

##### TXT

Txt file should have a url per row

##### ENEX (Evernote)

You can transfer all your web-clips (bookmarks) from Evernote to Raindrop.io, description and tags will be imported as well. Be sure to select `ENEX` as a file format of [export in Evernote](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-Export-notes-and-notebooks).

##### Pinterest

Pinterest itself doesn't have any tools to export your data. But you can try to use great third-party app called [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) that can help you download export file. Just follow instructions on [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) site.

#### Settings

Before you start import, please select how much data you want to transfer:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Only new folders and bookmarks** | When you upload the same import file again but with new data, this mode will prevent uploading duplicates and ensure structure untouched, only new folders and bookmarks will be imported.  
  
If you not sure select this mode |  
| **Import all** | Select this mode if you want to import everything as is (including duplicates) |  
| **Start from scratch** | This mode is the best way to clean your account data completely and replace it with data from import file.  
Be sure if you already have any data in Raindrop it will be removed and replaced. |

#### Limitations

- We support files up to 50Mb in size. If you have a larger file:
    1. [Optimize](https://optimize-bookmarks-html.glitch.me/)
    2. And upload to Raindrop as ZIP archive
- Evernote attachments are not supported yet
