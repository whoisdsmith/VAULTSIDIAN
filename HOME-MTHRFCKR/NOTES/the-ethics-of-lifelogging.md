# THE ETHICS OF LIFELOGGING

# ‘THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF YOU’

Wouldn’t it be fantastic if a person could easily recall every moment of his or her life?
Given that we live in such a technologically advanced society, why should a person ever
have to forget what happened, when it was, where it happened, who was there, why it
happened, and how he or she felt? If there was a system that could record everything a
person sees, hears, and feels, how would that enhance our lives? We have enhanced our
eye sight with prescription glasses, our hearing with hearing aids, and our timekeeping
ability with watches. Enhancement of personal memories seems to be a natural next
step.^1

Even though the paragraph above reads as though it has been taken from a science fiction novel,
it is in fact part of a text describing the University of Southern California’s Total Recall project. The
Total Recall project, which aims to design and develop such a personal information management
system, is one of the most noteworthy research projects about lifelogging to date.^2 The definition
of lifelogging that I will be employing in this paper is that formulated by Martin Dodge and Rob
Kitchin:
```

```
A life-log is conceived as a form of pervasive computing consisting of a unified, digital
record of the totality of an individual’s experiences, captured multi-modally through
digital sensors and stored permanently as a personal multi-media archive. It will provide
a record of the past that includes every action, every event, every conversation, every
material expression of an individual’s life; all events will be accessible at a future date be-
cause a life-log will be a searchable and recallable archive. Such a life-log will constitute
a new, pervasive socio- spatial archive as inherent in its construction will be a locational
record; it will detail everywhere an individual has been.^3
```

```
The verb ‘lifelogging’ then refers to the act or process of capturing and storing the totality of
one’s experiences, thereby creating a personal, searchable archive of one’s life.
After briefly assessing what benefits lifelogging could offer, I will investigate what the
possible ethical risks associated with the practice of lifelogging are. Moreover, I will analyse in
what way these risks are represented in the Black Mirror episode ‘The Entire History of You’ - an
episode that revolves around lifelogging.
```

```
Risks and Benefits
There are multiple benefits associated with lifelogging. Throughout history, we have used various
strategies and techniques to support our fallible, human memory. Lifelogging technology has the
potential to provide each of us with a complete and searchable archive of everything we have
ever experienced. However, lifelogs could be more than mere memory aids. One could argue,
for example, that by preserving a record of all of our experiences, the lifelog preserves a record
of us. In this sense, lifelogging constitutes a way to counteract the transience inherent in human
life.^4 Similarly, O’Hara, Shadbolt and Tuffield propose that the lifelog constitutes a locus for the
construction of identity. They go so far as to claim that ‘the lifelog, for the lifelogger, might consti-
tute the ‘real’ person’.^5 Whilst I would be cautious to equate a person’s identity with their lifelog
(which is a mere data set, rather than an embodied, living, feeling human being), I do think that
the lifelog could be helpful in providing us with plenty of raw material from which to craft our life
stories or narrative identities.^6

searcher emeritus Gordon Bell, and the LifeLog project of the American Defense and Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Moreover, lifelogs could help us evaluate our health and performance levels. Using  
predictive analytics, we could for example discover whether we are at risk of developing certain  
medical conditions and respond accordingly, e.g. through going to a doctor or by making lifestyle  
changes. It is here that we see a great deal of overlap with the Quantified Self movement, the  
slogan of which, ‘self-knowledge through numbers’, indicates its aim: for its users to keep track of  
and improve their health, fitness, and performance levels.^7  
Furthermore, lifelogging could increase accountability and personal security. As Anita Al-  
len phrases it, ‘a potential mugger or rapist would have to think twice in a society of lifeloggers’.^8  
Having perfect records of everything and everyone would constitute a huge asset for law enforce-  
ment and security services. At the same time, it could help protect innocent civilians from security  
forces by recording any abuses of power.  
Many of these benefits would, however, require the sharing of our personal lifelog data  
with others, whether it be health care professionals, security services, or the companies providing  
us with lifelogging technologies. It is here that the majority of privacy concerns arise.^9 Most of the  
ethical risks involved in lifelogging can be subsumed under two categories introduced by Anita  
Allen: pernicious memory and pernicious surveillance.^10 The notion of pernicious memory refers  
to the downsides of having a perfect memory machine. It is important to point out, as Allen does,  
that encountering the record of a past experience need not cause one to literally remember that  
experience; the record can merely serve as a prompt.^11 It is more important, however, to stress  
that a perfect memory is not an unqualified good. In fact, attention is increasingly being paid to  
the importance of forgetting as a necessary complement to memory.^12 Having a detailed archive  
of the totality of our experiences could enable excessive rumination as well as the dredging up of  
the past.^13 In order for us to move on, it may be crucial for both others and ourselves to forget the  
past, or at least to lay it to rest.  
The benefits of increased accountability and personal security would most likely come  
at the cost of increased surveillance. As both Dodge and Kitchin and Allen point out, lifelogging  
has both sousveillance and surveillance dimensions. It is sousveillance in the sense that our lifelog  
would capture data about ourselves or from the perspective of ourselves. It is surveillance, in  
the sense that our lifelogs would also capture data about others, including others who may also  
be engaged in acts of sousveillance or surveillance.^14 Lifelog data will need to be accessible and  
useable in order for us to reap its benefits, thus creating the risk of other people, either legally or  
illegally, accessing our private data.  
However, the most significant ethical risk of lifelogging, I would argue, is its potential to change  
who we are, both on an individual and on a societal level. The sheer knowledge that someone  
could access our private data can influence our behaviour.^15 If lifelogging were to become a com-  
mon practice, this could influence our reasonable expectations of privacy, as well as the potential  
for trust between people. As it is challenging for us to imagine what issues might arise in a society  
of lifeloggers, I will now turn to an artistic representation of such a society: the _Black Mirror_ epi-  
sode ‘The Entire History of You’.

‘The Entire History of You’  
‘The Entire History of You’, which revolves around protagonist Liam Foxwell, a young lawyer,  
starts with Liam’s work appraisal meeting. After leaving the meeting and getting into his car, Liam  
replays his recording of the meeting from his Grain, his lifelogging implant, and dwells on the  
parts of the appraisal that did not go so well. He subsequently arrives at an airport, where he is  
asked by security to fast forward through his recordings from the last week. We then see Liam  
arriving at a dinner party hosted by his wife Ffion’s friends, where he witnesses his wife talking to  
Jonas, a man he has never met before. Ffion’s friends enquire about Liam’s appraisal and suggest

9 As Anita Allen points out, the act of capturing data itself also implicates privacy concerns, especially if the recording contains  
expressions of the lives of other persons. Allen 2008: 54-55. Moreo-ver, lifelog data could potentially be illegally obtained, for example  
by hacking.10 Allen 2008: 55.

monitoring their online behaviour, they often adjust their behaviour and self-censor.

replaying the meeting for them all to see, so they can ‘appraise the appraisal’.^16 However, Jonas
steps in to save Liam from the embarrassment and the group sits down for dinner. During dinner,
Jonas speaks very frankly about his personal life; he mentions that he sometimes masturbates to
‘re-dos’ of ‘hot times’ from earlier relationships.^17 Liam becomes increasingly suspicious of the way
his wife looks at Jonas and laughs at his jokes. Together, the group of friends watches some Grain
recordings from several years ago.
Back at home, Liam and Ffion watch the recordings from their baby daughter’s Grain,
taken when the baby was at home with the babysitter. During their conversation, it turns out that
Jonas is in fact ‘Mr Marrakesh’, someone Ffion dated in the past.^18 Ffion had previously down-
played her relationship with ‘Mr Marrakesh’, claiming it had only lasted a week, but from the Grain
footage that was played at the party, Liam discovered that Ffion and Jonas in fact dated for much
longer. The couple gets into a row, but they ultimately make up and have sex (while both watch-
ing ‘re-dos’ of more passionate moments from earlier in their relationship).
After they finish, Liam returns to the living room to watch more of his Grain’s recordings
of the dinner party, all the while drinking heavily. He continues doing this all night and also uses
lip-read reconstruction software to find out what Ffion and Jonas said to each other at the party.
Liam gets increasingly worked up and becomes convinced that something has been going on
between Jonas and his wife. Ignoring his Grain’s warnings that he is not fit to drive, Liam gets in
his car and drives over to Jonas’ house to confront him. Under threat of violence, Liam then forces
Jonas to show his Grain’s recordings of Ffion on a TV screen and to wipe them all.
Next, Liam wakes up having driven his car into a tree. He walks home, where he con-
fronts Ffion with something he found out from Jonas’s Grain: the fact that Jonas and Ffion slept
with each other some 18 months ago, around the time their daughter was conceived. Liam forces
Ffion to show her recordings of her and Jonas, in order for her to prove that Jonas wore a con-
dom and Liam is indeed the father of her baby. The closing scenes show Liam walking around his
now empty house, replaying recordings of happier times with his wife and daughter, before he
goes into the bathroom to cut out his Grain with a razor and cuticle clippers.
The problems of pernicious memory and pernicious surveillance are clearly depicted in this
episode. We witness Liam’s excessive rumination over his appraisal meeting. Moreover, Liam’s Grain
enables him to ‘re-do’ moments from the dinner party over and over again, fuelling his suspicions
and mistrust of his wife. Even though it turns out that Liam’s suspicions were justified, he is none the
happier for it. The risks of dredging up the past, too, are strongly represented. In his job appraisal,
Liam asks whether ‘we’, i.e. the law firm, are ‘morally okay’ with litigation in retrospective parenting
cases: cases where children sue their parents for damages caused by mistakes or shortcomings in
their upbringing.^19 From his tone and facial expression, it is clear that Liam has his doubts about the
practice. The scene in which Liam replays footage of himself threatening Jonas with violence, too,
invokes the risk of dredging up the past, as the viewer knows that this event, which was also record-
ed by Jonas’ Grain, could seriously damage Liam’s career and even his entire future.
This last example brings me to the problems of pernicious surveillance and threats to
privacy. Liam’s lifelog data is not only accessible to him; it will also be accessed by his employer
if his contract is to be renewed, as well as by airport security whenever he needs to take a flight.
Furthermore, we witness Ffion’s friends softly pressuring Liam to ‘re-do’ his interview with them.
As soon as Liam and Ffion come home from the dinner party, they replay the recordings from
their daughter’s Grain to make sure nothing strange happened while they were away. Their baby
daughter is completely unable to deny them access to her Grain.
Most importantly, however, we see that lifelogging can change people and the rela-
tionships between people. In a world where everyone has a lifelog and where these lifelogs are
accessible by others, both our individual privacy and the privacy of our relationships is compro-
mised. The fact that everything we (and everyone around us) have ever done is on record can
seriously damage our expectations of privacy, as well as the relations of trust between people. As
he is reviewing footage from the dinner party, we see Liam becoming more and more paranoid.

At one point, Liam exclaims: ‘This isn’t me! Look at what you’re doing to me!’ - where ‘you’ refers  
to Ffion.^20 The viewer knows that rather than Ffion doing this to him, this is what Liam does to  
himself under the influence of his Grain.

Reflection  
‘The Entire History of You’ clearly represents the risks of pernicious memory and pernicious  
surveillance. Furthermore, it shows us what could happen to people and to interpersonal relation-  
ships in a society of lifeloggers. Of course, ‘The Entire History of You’ is an artistic representation  
of a society in which lifelogging is a widespread, accepted phenomenon; it is not a real world  
scenario. I do, however, think that such a representation can encourage viewers to think about  
the ethical risks of lifelogging and possibly help them to better understand these risks. In a sense,  
‘The Entire History of You’ thus serves as a warning to its viewers.  
As I mentioned before, ever more scientists are acknowledging the importance of forget-  
ting in the digital age. Bannon, Dodge and Kitchen and van Bree are exploring ways in which for-  
getting could be built into lifelogging technology. Allen, on the other hand, focuses more on the  
laws, rights and regulations that could support the safe implementation of lifelogging into society.  
Lifelogging in the strict definition that is employed in this paper may never come into being on a  
large scale. Nevertheless, some aspects of lifelogging are already implemented in today’s society

- think for example of how our mobile phones already generate a locational record, or of all the  
    digitised memories we have posted on social media – and more are likely to follow. ‘The Entire  
    History of You’ shows us how pervasive lifelogging technology could be and urges us to reflect on  
    the possible impact of lifelogging technology on the way we live our lives. As everyone would be  
    affected in a society of lifeloggers, it is crucial that not only those developing the technology, but  
    also lawyers, philosophers, artists, and the general public reflect on how we can best benefit from  
    lifelogging technology without falling victim to its risks.
