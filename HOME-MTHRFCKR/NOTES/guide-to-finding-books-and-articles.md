This guide, styled in the same way as the [Guide to Finding Films](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://web.archive.org/web/20201101130427/https://bit.ly/Film-Guide%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609947095%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw292BiJUMFG7BsoHlttus8U&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610007179&usg=AOvVaw3o58WiMhCu30ficmbac7Qg), is designed to help locate articles and books. Thanks to [Avery Mensch](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.facebook.com/amg.mensch%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609947267%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1AFnJcX-u0grQOcpaoB6Ro&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610007294&usg=AOvVaw1OKuhnPCYd2m-_vdMaqXye) for the graphic above.

Background

-   What is Sci-Hub?

-   ([Wikipedia link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609947840%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3SvRVFa24BrfDaNWKCTIfk&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610007536&usg=AOvVaw3Oj9kRMbz9bZg-LfYqR0Uz)) tl;dr — a website that bypasses many (not all!) academic paywalls to access articles (and sometimes books).

-   How does it work?

-   Generous people with institutional access gave credentials to Alexandra Elbakyan (the founder), which are used to access papers. If a paper has been searched for and retrieved before, it is stored in a server so that all future requests for it are fulfilled instantaneously.

-   Has Sci-Hub obtained credentials through phishing or other nefarious methods?

-   Despite uncorroborated accusations of such, there is [no evidence](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://engineuring.wordpress.com/2017/07/02/some-facts-on-sci-hub-that-wikipedia-gets-wrong/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609948457%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3wdPXjBoLgSpr_d4ihRogb&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610007820&usg=AOvVaw0eJ_UzzXggCEM0wC-9ou7R) of this.

-   What is Library Genesis?

-   ([Wikipedia link](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609948791%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0QOxKyUQg0MTwie0mUG9Pl&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610008101&usg=AOvVaw3bPDIKs4hqjxuIEAOEgI6R)) tl;dr — a website that hosts user-uploaded books and articles.

-   Is this illegal?

-   Depends on your definition. Some notes [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://engineuring.wordpress.com/2018/07/07/why-sci-hub-is-illegal-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609949164%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3TssVg5KYOU25KL1cyWanu&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610008294&usg=AOvVaw1fek8lZ6rcCKKyFLtpmO-S).  
    

GUIDE TO FINDING AN ARTICLE ([sci-hub.se](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://sci-hub.tw%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609949560%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0K68uHp5r0NmSyrevYrl1q&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610008416&usg=AOvVaw2C-2kYv8WyyUMTb1t5tofC))

1.  Locate the DOI ([digital object identifier](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609949946%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0he3U69z0wZul_G5ui-9EM&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610008544&usg=AOvVaw06VojJDq8fijXY_Hw5bcZC)) of the article if possible (not all articles have DOIs). The URL of the article on the publisher’s website may work if the article does not have a DOI.
2.  Paste the DOI into Sci-Hub’s text bar and click Open.
3.  You may be prompted to enter a [CAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609950365%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1nD09uwrm5mF_8r5NefoZQ&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610008723&usg=AOvVaw2v_8zMG6_y5JM1-aFB2DJ4). Do not be alarmed if the text is in Cyrillic—it’s simply telling you to type in the characters in the image to prove that you are a human.
4.  Sci-Hub will either produce the paper or inform you that it does not have access to it.

NOTES/FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ERRORS

-   Sometimes you will get a 500 Internal Server Error or 504 Gateway Time-out. In most cases, this means that Sci-Hub has the paper, but the server is temporarily overloaded. Refreshing the page a few times ought to fix this (you may have to re-enter CAPTCHA’s with every refresh). If it doesn’t work immediately, you can try again a bit later too.
-   Sometimes papers on Philosophy Documentation Center (PDCNet) and other databases are also on JSTOR, Project Muse, etc., which are typically accessible by Sci-Hub. If you suspect that this is the case, check Google Scholar for all the places that your paper is hosted and try the non-PDCNet links in Sci-Hub.
-   Does Sci-Hub work on mobile?

-   Yes! Plug in the URL or DOI as you would on desktop. There is also a [Telegram bot](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://t.me/scihubot%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609951673%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3HUk1tE9cVmpwexs6wDPIS&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610009138&usg=AOvVaw2Es7y7HTYvJoVXE4wYfOvd).

-   Can I search by title on Sci-Hub?

-   This used to be a functionality through an installable plugin but now appears to have been discontinued. Find the article’s DOI, and if none exists, use the URL to the article. You can, however, search [Library Genesis](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://libgen.is/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609952204%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw05nQFCZ2pcqs2J0idVP4cx&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610009324&usg=AOvVaw1fyNuwhGGKiciEmVGpelIB) by title (click Scientific Articles).

-   If I am looking for a book chapter, will Sci-Hub help?

-   Sometimes. With SpringerLink books, Sci-Hub often has the whole book. Other times if you plug in the DOI of a chapter, it will direct you to the Library Genesis listing for the book. But the bulk of the material on Sci-Hub is articles.

-   Sci-Hub is blocked by my Internet Service Provider/institution/etc.—what should I do?

-   Use [Tor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://torproject.com/download%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609952955%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3zuabmxU_w9ZjF7z9l_7MC&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610009653&usg=AOvVaw06aXSuKcwuo-IIvFfHgSYU) or [Opera](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.opera.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609953184%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0WV93h2CVjRpCqCaxR4Cfu&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610009757&usg=AOvVaw27cGn83tcwr5r_E20O0qbE) or [Windscribe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://windscribe.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609953418%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0xZb3JRGwsSL3Q6tIfzS69&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610009852&usg=AOvVaw0jYqMJm5lcRAJKeIT6epsB) (or any virtual private network) to circumvent this easily—all free and easy to set up.

-   I can’t read Cyrillic. What do I do?

-   Copy-paste the text into a translator. Google Chrome has built-in translation.

-   Which platforms does Sci-Hub have access to? Which does it not?

-   There’s no official list, but this is what can be noted from experience: Taylor and Francis Online, SpringerLink, PEP Web, SagePub, Wiley Online, ScienceDirect, Oxford University Press, Cambridge Core (for books, must use individual chapters’ DOIs/URLs), ScienceDirect (most papers), JSTOR (for some papers), De Gruyter (for some papers), Brill (for some papers), Project Muse (for some chapters—must use individual chapter DOI’s), Oxford Scholarship Online (for some chapters—must use individual chapter DOI’s), Philosophy Documentation Center, ProQuest, HeinOnline, MIS Quarterly. NOTE: just because you find an article hosted on one of these red sites, that does not necessarily mean it’s not on Sci-Hub, because often articles are on multiple databases (e.g., both Project Muse and JSTOR). That’s why it can sometimes be useful to try multiple URLs.

-   I am in search of a rather obscure work. Will Sci-Hub have it?

-   As implied in the above question, Sci-Hub’s access is independent of how mainstream or obscure the piece is. It depends on which database it is in (and, with some databases, whether it is in a subset of the database to which Sci-Hub has access). So, try; you may be surprised.

-   How can it be that Sci-Hub has partial access to some platforms?

-   Because universities subscribe to subsets of platforms too. (That is why, for example, one can access some JSTOR papers with a particular university’s institutional access but not others.) So, Sci-Hub’s particular subset of access is determined by the credentials it has.

-   I have access to a database that Sci-Hub doesn’t yet have access to. Can I help improve Sci-Hub?

-   Hopefully! Try [emailing](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://sci-hub.se/alexandra%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609956664%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2O02K55XiEG1P0h5D6M2R0&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610010829&usg=AOvVaw0SCBwqcKHpixAcWLOKQiym) Alexandra Elbakyan or sending her a [Facebook message](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.facebook.com/alexandra.elbakyan%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609956936%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0nqHj1-dalUQNdSO6FZqDe&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610010925&usg=AOvVaw0FlbGU1Ki09D-NkSApWiND).  
    

GUIDE TO FINDING A BOOK ([libgen.is](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://libgen.is%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609957481%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1fXN7FqgWjPgDOAR49dFTY&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610011025&usg=AOvVaw3YicLt67gQKbGMeG1LnjJR))

1.  Search by title, ensuring that Non-fiction / Sci-tech is the selected option (if indeed you are searching for a monograph—adjust accordingly if you are searching for fiction, etc.).
2.  Click the correct result. If there isn’t one, Library Genesis does not have your book (yet).
3.  Click the cover image of the book..
4.  Click GET (or any of the IPFS links).
5.  Your PDF/EPUB/DjVu/MOBI is now downloaded. Enjoy!

NOTES/FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ERRORS

-   What’s DjVu? Why is my PDF reader not opening it?

-   A file format similar to PDF. Most PDF readers cannot open it. Simply use an online tool like [this one](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://djvu2pdf.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609958462%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0ZcW0tddXtcbi4yclD6ql0&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610011402&usg=AOvVaw1OFpiD82YI-BQuzKPmj2TC) to convert it to PDF.

-   What’s EPUB/MOBI?

-   eReader formats which, unlike PDF, are not paginated. Thus, conversion to PDF is possible, but the pagination will be quasi-arbitrary, and the formatting won’t be so nice. Best to read these on an eReader like [calibre](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://calibre-ebook.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609958783%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1vtA8NiCPu1EiDUt59qCb1&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610011598&usg=AOvVaw3cY8jY7BvMtuDsyLzB5p8Y).

-   Upon searching, I’m getting “User ‘libgen_read’ has exceeded the ‘max_user_connections’ resource”?

-   Like the aforementioned 500 Internal Server error with Sci-Hub, this is a server-side error. Refreshing the page, or waiting a minute and searching again usually resolves it.

-   Library Genesis is blocked by my Internet Service Provider/institution/etc.—what should I do?

-   As with Sci-Hub, use [Tor](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://torproject.com/download%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609959312%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0nZ8-3zdDBN0y9UKsQlcZC&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610011810&usg=AOvVaw3owjnm8xwMZzzW82zaX-bt) or [Opera](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://www.opera.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609959468%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2Kt69gcjyiYVTVhNiU0qqO&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610011880&usg=AOvVaw1l_oNnjerdKOe_YyFLX2us) or [Windscribe](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://windscribe.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609959612%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw28SW4kDBwpGmziU_L78Zlj&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610011953&usg=AOvVaw3W_ycb3Oq4gkm2ShjqltJy) (or any virtual private network) to circumvent this easily—all free and easy to set up.

-   Does Library Genesis also have articles?

-   Yes. Click on Scientific articles (or any of the other options below the search bar) on the home page to access these.

-   Can I upload a book to Library Genesis?

-   Yes! Just go to [libgen.is/libarian](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://libgen.is/libarian%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609960167%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2XQAuWETFvLkJ4xOswu8Ea&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610012154&usg=AOvVaw2TNG5bUunJ_gifS39zP0rn) (username: genesis, password: upload) and you will see the rules and instructions (e.g., no watermarks, only certain formats, etc.) for doing so there. You can remove watermarks with [Adobe Acrobat Pro](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://telegra.ph/Adobe-latest-pre-activated-software-cc-2020-and-2019-Google-Drive-04-18%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609960389%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw3UCnLusN1NrsXkib1iMyA7&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610012267&usg=AOvVaw1pFJhaRrS_MAH65ff_TFXd), and you can remove [DRM](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609960573%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1z9PKCIJPbBsPGH6UPTyiy&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610012370&usg=AOvVaw2W1bQca2TgRlSYoEDsI7_n) with [this](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://apprenticealf.wordpress.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609960730%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0w2aqWtbvIF5zXbrkZ4XFE&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610012448&usg=AOvVaw2zkjLZUKIat4F1Zh6GGVas) ([VitalSource](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://vitalsource.com/%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609960861%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw0fSOSOLrcOxTAAhmpgYUGg&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610012539&usg=AOvVaw0qQ4yTUFMpqx2Jso5ujPGy) ePub instructions [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11eatONdJvvf8wm67w_a8HdJ0spG-4OpdcuLcPn8i2LU/edit?usp%253Dsharing%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609961114%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw1YpbSRMDhn2cg8TBzwT_wm&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610012644&usg=AOvVaw1qGndN2KQu7Z8h6NyCes8g)).

-   The website is asking me for a username and password? Why?

-   The username is genesis and the password is upload. Library Genesis recently has an upload queue for quality purpose control, so new uploads that have yet to clear the queue can only be accessed through library.bz, which is password-protected. After clearing the queue (which usually doesn’t take longer than a day), they can be accessed at the regular site.

-   I’m getting a 401 error (on the .bz site)?

-   Don’t use Facebook Preview. You must use a proper browser.

-   Useful catalog of books and their holdings in libraries around the world. Very useful in determining whether or not a native (i.e., published by the publisher, not scanned) eBook of a particular title exists. Search the title and then narrow by eBook in the left sidebar, and then click on the result to see which databases have the eBook.

[Google Scholar](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttp://scholar.google.com%26amp;sa%3DD%26amp;source%3Deditors%26amp;ust%3D1669863609963231%26amp;usg%3DAOvVaw2djzGrT_DsLWWqMecTdCOY&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669863610013387&usg=AOvVaw0FCxObngIhHsC_gvP3Nelc)

-   Useful for finding all the places a paper may be published. Often a paper behind a paywall is freely available elsewhere, and Google Scholar usually lists the link.

-   Open the .acsm file you have downloaded from the Internet Archive in Adobe Digital Editions (double-clicking it should suffice). Don’t worry if it doesn’t display properly.
-   Locate the PDF (or EPUB) file that was downloaded by the .acsm file by right-clicking the book in Adobe Digital Editions (you may have to click the back arrow to return to Adobe Digital Editions’ main screen) and selecting Show File in Explorer (Windows) or Show File in Finder (Mac).
-   Drag the PDF (or EPUB) that you found in Finder/Explorer to calibre (or the other software, if you chose one of those).
-   For calibre users: click “Click to open” next to “Path” in the calibre sidebar to locate the imported PDF (or EPUB) file of the book once it has finished importing. For users of the other software: you should get a message saying that the file has been de-DRM’ed, and you can now locate that file in Finder/Explorer.
-   This file should now be DRM-free. If you wish, you can verify this by opening it in any PDF (or EPUB) application. (Attempting to do the same thing with the previously-located PDF (or EPUB) file straight from Adobe Digital Editions ought to yield blank pages or an error.)
-   Return the book on the Internet Archive wepbage (so that others can borrow it).
-   Bonus: upload the de-DRM’ed book to Library Genesis (instructions in the Library Genesis FAQ above) so that others seeking the same book do not have to go through the same rigmarole!
