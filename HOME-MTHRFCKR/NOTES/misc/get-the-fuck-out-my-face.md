# Get the fuck out my face

Get the fuck out my face
Stay the fuck out my way
Tellin me every day
That I ain’t shit but that’s ok
Get the fuck out my face
Stay the fuck out my way
Tellin me every day
That I ain’t shit but that’s ok

Broke my heart stabbed my back
Left me for dead found in the trash
Now I’m a ghost that can’t let go
Eyes glow red outside your window
Broke my heart stabbed my back
Left me for dead found in the trash
Now I’m a ghost that can’t let go
Eyes glow red outside your window
