Favorite tweet: A 30 year old man. The same age as my little brother. Leaving behind a 450mb zip file as a monument to a brief life’s work as they exit, stage left. … Be gentle to yourself, those you love, and those you care enough to be angry with. Reach out where and when you can. — Archarzel (@Archarzel) Jan 6, 2022
