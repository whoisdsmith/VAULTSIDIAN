[Building a Modern Memex – Andrew Louis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0WU02flF_E)

The Memex was proposed in 1945 as the ultimate organizational tool. The desk-sized device would store a user’s personal library and allow for information to be searched, organized, connected together with hyperlinks, and shared. Without a device like this, its creator suggested, our species would drown in information overload and come to a premature end. Tragically, zero of these devices were ever produced, but 72 years later, Andrew has built a Memex in JavaScript. He’s built importers for dozens of different sources of personal data and data consumptions and put it all behind a graph-based API. He’ll be going over the history of the Memex and demoing his own version by showing what type of queries, organizing tools, and visualization are available.

[Keep Ruby Weird 2018 – Using Ruby to build a modern Memex! by Andrew Louis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTG5UMSQR8E)

Keep Ruby Weird 2018 – Using Ruby to build a modern Memex! by Andrew Louis Andrew is a software developer based in Toronto. He’s currently working on building a digital Memex as well as researching the history of similar projects. Previously, he was the co-founder and CTO of ShopLocket, an ecommerce startup acquired in 2014. When he’s not coding, he spends his time on obsessive projects such as attempting to bike on every street in Toronto, taking photos of only doors (instagram: @hyfen), and making voxel art.
