# Make Amends, Guess Again

Make amends, guess again  
Cause you were never my friend  
Just a snake who’s a fake  
Some day you will be replaced  
Guess that’s fate  
don’t care about what you say  
It never mattered anyways  
Instead I’ll take all the blame  
I don’t play the games you play

Another day can’t wash away  
All the pain and all the hate

Hell is where you can stay  
Fuck you for everything
