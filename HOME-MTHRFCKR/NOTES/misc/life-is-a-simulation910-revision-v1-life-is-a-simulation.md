I know what depression is, what it feels like. What it does to you, what it makes you do to others.

I know when it’s here and when it goes away.

This isn’t depression. This is something different. This is a place that is void of all emotion.

There’s no anger or darkness. No sadness or happiness.

Just an empty vessel that runs on Adderall and technology.

I don’t communicate what I feel to anyone anymore. I avoid conversation as much as possible. I push those that care away.

I want to believe it’s because I don’t want them to be infected by this purgatory inside me.

That’s probably what you want to hear, rather than me just saying

> “I don’t care if I sever the lines that I have intertwined and attached to those who are closest to me”

I am a fraud and a hypocrite.

I wanted to be better and do better, but I am who I am and if I can’t change that, than that is and will always be the end of it.

I don’t feel suicidal in any way, I don’t have the effort or ambition to end this. I just wake up every day and the cycle continues on an endless loop.

**Infinite Loop**

```

An infinite loop, which repeats indefinitely, is often created when a programmer writes a loop in which the expression tested never becomes false.
