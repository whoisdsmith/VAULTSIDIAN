# Linking journal entries

Entries can be linked using the URL scheme in Day One. Copying a link from one entry and pasting in another is a great way to navigate to other entries quickly. 

## iOS

  1. Tap the More (•••) button at the top right of an entry, then Entry Info. Or the Map at the bottom of an entry to access the [Entry Info/Metadata view](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/882775-entry-info-metadata-in-day-one-for-ios). 

  2. Tap _Entry ID_.

  3. In the sheet that appears, you can choose from three options: _Copy Entry URL_, _Copy Markdown Link_, and _Copy Entry ID_. **Tap _Copy Markdown Link_. (For including a link in an entry, this is the best option.)**

  4. Open another entry and tap where you would like to place the cursor. Paste the link in this entry by long-pressing (press and hold a finger on the spot where you want to add your link), then tap _Paste_.

  5. Dismiss the keyboard by tapping the down arrow at the top left of the keyboard or swipe down on the keyboard.
