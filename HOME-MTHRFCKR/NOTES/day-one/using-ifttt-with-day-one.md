## What is it?

If you’re not familiar with [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com/day_one) (If This Then That), it’s a free web-based service that allows users to create chains of simple conditional statements, called “applets”, which are triggered based on changes to other web services. IFTTT is a great way to automatically add content from many web services including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more. You can even set up an SMS trigger to create a journal entry via [text message](https://ifttt.com/recipes/397816-create-a-journal-entry-via-text-message)!

## Get started

IFTTT requires Day One Sync. Day One Sync is available to all Plus (grandfathered) and Premium users. 

You will create a free account at [IFTTT.com.](http://IFTTT.com) Then you can begin creating "applets". These are the services you can connect that will automatically create entries based on the criteria you choose.  You can have entries created in Day One every time you send a tweet, or post a new Facebook status.  You can send an email to IFTTT that will create entries in Day One.  

Once you sign up for an account, click **My Applets** to get started.  Many recommendations will be available. Once you have chosen a desired "trigger" you will need to connect your Day One Sync account. _If you use Apple ID to sign in to Day One Sync, please be sure to use the link to Authenticate with Apple ID._

Connect here: <https://ifttt.com/day_one/>

Note: We currently limit up to 100 entries created per day via IFTTT.

Names of encrypted journals will not appear on IFTTT. The order will coincide with the journal order in the app. The journal ID can also be located to match up the correct encrypted journal. See [here](https://help.dayoneapp.com/en/articles/3613974-locating-a-journal-id). 

## Troubleshooting

If your journals do not appear when creating a new applet, you may not be connected properly to your Day One account in [IFTTT.com](http://IFTTT.com)
