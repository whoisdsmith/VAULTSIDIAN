## Markdown Information

[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), created by John Gruber of Daring Fireball, is the technology we chose to use to allow rich text within Day One journal entries. Markdown allows *italic* and **bold**, along with several other simple formatting options that can be written using plain text and display properly in Read views. Markdown syntax is available in Day One and is toggled **On** by default.

Day One for Android does not have a Markdown toolbar, but the Markdown syntax featured on this page can be manually typed out to format text.

Day One takes a similar approach to Markdown as GitHub. See [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/).
