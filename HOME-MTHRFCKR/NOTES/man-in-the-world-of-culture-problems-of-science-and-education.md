### Abstract

```
Computer-brain analogies are ubiquitous in contemporary culture. They also have a
long and relevant history. Throughout the history of computer development, computers
as “brain-mimicking machines” were used as blueprints for computer design, as
inspiration for new visionary ideas, as tools of liberation and as ideological construct
obscuring actually existing power relations. Today, with the growing disenchantment
with the results of digital transformation, we are forced to admit that these analogies
often underpin relationships between human and technology that are disempowering
and increasingly problematic.

## 1\. Introduction

```
“Human as a machine” and “machine as human” analogies have a long and rich
cultural history. The use of such metaphors and analogies increased with the pace
of the technological progress, and their cultural functions have become increasingly
more varied and complex. From La Mettrie’s L’Homme Machine (1748) to early Soviet
experiments in which “a machine becomes a tutor, an object of worship and mimesis”
[ 2 ], “human-machine” analogy acquired layered of symbolic and practical significance.
The use of this analogy in digital computing both followed the previous trends and
developed unique characteristic suitable to a computer age.

## 2\. A Brain-mimicking Machine

For obvious reasons, the development of “human–computer” analogy very early on  
became focused on the “brain–computer” association. Unlike the 19th-century mechan-  
ical machinery readily lending itself to comparisons with the body, computers as “think-  
ing” information processing machines were closely associated with the brain and its  
powers.

Vannevar Bush is generally credited as the originator of the idea of universal “think-  
ing archive” based on associative principles mimicking the “natural” distribution of  
knowledge and thought processes. In his idea of memex, Bush thought to overcome  
informational overload and the “artificiality of systems of indexing.” \[6, p. 9\] He wrote:  
“The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in  
its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts,  
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain.” \[Ibid\]

Bush, of course, was not the first thinker who grappled with inefficiencies and limita-  
tions of the dominant paper-based culture of his time, but he was the first to develop  
a comprehensive model of a brain-mimicking machine that combined both useful and  
utopian traits. Memex would be a machine that existed in symbiosis with human mind  
mimicking general principles of the human brain and influencing it back: “As the  
human mind moulds the machine, so the machine also ‘remoulds’ the human mind,  
‘\[remoulding\] the trails of the user’s brain, as one lives and works in close interconnection  
with a machine’.” \[1, p. 29\]

Echoing 20th-century utopian impulses, Bush even believed that such a machine  
could be used to improve the humanity in general: by inheriting personal memexes of  
great minds or by simply using a memex we can evolve better minds: “Can the race  
thus develop leaders, of such power and intellect, and such forces of conviction, that  
the world can be saved from its follies?” \[1, p. 34\]

Bush’s memex was, of course, not digital – it was thoroughly mechanical. \[ 1 \] However,  
his main ideas – that we can use technology to create knowledge tools that are more  
“organic”, that work according to the way our physical brain works — became particularly  
inspirational with the emergence of a digital computer.

It seems that by the 1960s the development of brain-computer analogy followed  
the two distinctive trends. The first one was inspired by the cybernetic approach and  
influenced the emerging computer science: it strove to mimic how the brain works, to  
“reproduce” the brain through circuits (either in their structure or in their function). As

such, this trend became a precursor of present-day artificial intelligence and neural  
networks.

The second trend saw an increasingly widespread use of the brain-computer anal-  
ogy as a metaphor widely applied to different fields and ideas and inspiring a lot of  
experimentation in the most diverse areas – from structuralist and linguistic theories to  
poetic visions to self-help tutorials.

In 1960s these two trends intersected within the emerging field of personal computing  
in two very distinctive and very influential ways. Doug Engelbart and Ted Nelson, the  
two groundbreaking figures of early computer revolution, represent differing but closely  
connected approaches to the computer-brain analogy.

Doug Engelbart developed his own theory of technological development based on  
his understanding on all technology and culture as “augmentation” systems: the systems  
that are not inherited but “installed” in the brain, as in computer software installation \[1,  
p. 38\]. Engelbart believed that humans exist in symbiosis with their technical tools, in  
what he called an ”integrated man-machine relationship’. \[1, p. 39\] The goal of computer  
technology was the augmentation of human intellect and creativity and bringing this  
goal to life required developing and improving our tools.

Importantly, Engelbart did not believe in direct imitation of biological structures:  
rather, he was convinced of an inherent artificiality of all technology. Since purely  
“natural” technology does not exist, technological revolution should not be reduced to  
the imitation of nature. In Engelbart’s view, humans and machines co-exist in constant  
adjustment loop which is never perfect but could be constantly improved and worked  
upon. How we use computers is heavily influenced by the tools we use to use them:  
from physical manipulation of a mouse to the conventions of user interface.

On the other hand, Ted Nelson represents the visionary adherence to the idea of  
computers as liberators from the limitations of existing culture and technology that was  
very much a part of 1960s–1970s Zeitgeist. “The prison of paper, enforcing sequence  
and rectangularity, had been the enemy of authors and editors for thousands of years;  
now at last we could break free.” \[1, p. 70\] Nelson’s vision is based on the “either–  
or” approach: paper-based culture represents the “prison” of mind, while computer-  
empowered hypertext opens the unfettered and unlimited field of creativity.

Nelson’s fusion of computer-based hypertext with the ideas of liberation and creativity  
represent an important step in the merging of computer culture with counterculture. \[ 8 \]  
The “computer–brain” analogy proved its adaptability to different contexts, zigzagging  
between the idea of augmentation, i.e. adding something that did not exist before, and  
an expression of “what is already there”.

## 3\. From an Idea to an Ideology

Both Engelbart’s and Nelson’s projects, despite their differences, were bound to a  
vision of a human-computer symbiosis that was supposed to augment human cognition,  
memory and creativity. More importantly, this vision placed such a symbiosis at a level  
beyond market or political forces, inside a realm of scientific, artistic or personal self-  
fulfillment. Both projects, therefore, were thoroughly undermined and subverted by the  
commercialization of the Web.

This subversion can be traced back to as early as 1980s, when Apple developed  
the first commercially successful graphical user interface. In the subsequent competi-  
tion with Microsoft, both companies succeeded in establishing and monopolizing user  
interface conventions. Importantly, during this process the idea of an interface that  
provides human–computer symbiotic interaction was utilized and transformed in ways  
that completely undermined the original visions of 1960s and 1970s innovators. Unlike  
Engelbart’s vision, in which interface was supposed to be a meeting place between  
technically aware user and a machine – a meeting place that, in a constant feedback  
loop, was meant to empower the user and augment his/her creative and cognitive  
abilities – the “naturalness” of commercialized graphic interfaces was meant to obscure  
technology from the user, limiting their options and discouraging exploration. The  
contradiction between these two approaches was noted at the time and still remains a  
topic of discussion.

The next stage came during the 2000s with the emergence of Web 2.0 and the  
beginnign of platform capitalism. While ostensibly Web 2.0 celebrated human sociality  
and the freedom provided by digital technology, in reality the concepts borrowed  
from 1970s countercultural digital utopia were increasingly used to justify creeping  
monopolization, surveillance and usurpation of user autonomy. The idea that Web  
2.0 was undermining hierarchy, opening up borders and providing ways for more  
“natural” thinking and knowing were ubiquitous during this period. The growing ease  
of access meant that now users could be expected to be always “plugged in”, always  
online – a condition that many believed was a logical step towards the perfect human-  
computer symbiosis. As has been noted repeatedly, Wikipedia became an exemplary  
project of this era symbolizing collective brain and collectively produced body of non-  
hierarchical socially-enabled knowledge. The ideological justification of Web 2.0, which  
was effectively an extension of Silicon Valley ideology, developed the idea of human-  
computer symbiosis in ways that legitimized and justified the developing platform  
monopolies.

```
Technological platforms seek to become “natural” in ways that has nothing to do
with personal empowerment or 1960s-like unfettered creativity. Instead of augmenting
human cognition, platform monopolies usurp the more low-level, instinctual regions
of the brain in their search to capture user attention and maximize their time on the
platforms [ 4 ], [ 5 ]. The human–machine symbiosis thus becomes a self-undermining
condition “by which interaction turns into immersion, autonomy into automaticity, control
into compulsion” [ 3 ] At the same time, the growing success of neural networks and AI
technologies produce increasing anxieties about computers “usurping” human intellec-
tual domain, becoming “smarter” than the humans, undermining what was thought to
be the essence of humanity.
The pushback against this trend has been well underway for years now. The criticism
is everywhere, in what can be termed a “great disappointment” in the lost utopian
expectations of the digital age. As Jaron Lanier wrote in his 2010 manifesto: “People
degrade themselves in order to make machines seem smart all the time.” [7, p. 26]
This “degradation” is as much a product of socio-economic circumstances as it is a
result of computers actually getting better at cognition. instead augmenting human
intellect, current digital interfaces and algorithms actually dumb us down, are now
found everywhere
```

## 4\. Conclusion

```
Over the course of several decades, “brain-computer” analogy emerged as one of
the leading metaphors of our digital age. It has become entrenched in our culture,
down to the everyday language in which we refer to our thought processes using
computer analogies. We now routinely talk about “uploading”, going offline or becom-
ing plugged in, doing thought processing etc. Despite thus becoming “naturalized”,
computer-brain analogies play complex and often contradictory roles in contemporary
culture. They can drive innovation, create inspiring visions, provide cognitive tools
to better adjust ourselves to the ubiquitous digital technology. Equally though, they
can become ideologically-laden constructs that obscure and mystify the workings of
technology and of the socio-economic forces that govern our world.
