 **Abstract**

 As we become more and more involved with digital technologies on a daily basis, we are in need of a model to make sense of what we _do_ with and “in” them. Here we analyze the use of digital media by way of a accumulating, organizing, and showing – strongly resemble the practice of collectors. In the first _collecting_ paradigm, since our online activities – centered on selecting, (^)  part of the paper, we outline the main traits of collecting practices, and discuss relevant online practices in the light of these traits, thereby tracing the contours of an online “collecting culture.”In the second part, we list the possible underlying causes and motivations for collecting, and (^)  investigate how far these explanations also apply to online activity, so offering a preliminary framework for the further study of online practices.

    **Introduction**  
    Browsing, clicking, sharing, uploading, downloading, ... Our daily online practices have  
    spawned an array of new verbs or old ones taking on new meanings. These are signposts of intense activity. Whereas most digital technologies originally served calculating andcommunicating means, today our use of them shines with radiant colors. In what follows we (^) attempt to make sense of this variety of uses, by looking at them from an unexpected angle: our  online activities show remarkable similarities with collecting practicesshare some of the motivations that underlie the latter. and, perhaps, the former  
 
 To illustrate what we mean, let’s take a quick look at, for example, your average Web use.Disregard technical considerations for a minute: involvement with keyboards, mouse pads, Wi-Fi (^) networks, ...
 Even abstract from specific websites with which you’re interacting. Gaze upon the unbridled activity going on. What do you discern? A myriad mass of images, words, sounds,shards of conversation, more or less neatly arranged in more or less prefab patterns, actively (^) structured and consciously unleashed upon a world of onlookers – most of them being just as active – or simply upon ourselves. We grasp, take together, order and observe. We play aroundwith “things,” however information-like, moving them about, amassing them, discarding them. (^)  

All along our profiles, interfaces, photo pages, music libraries, we keep the view. Gather, name,save, and show. We _collect_?  
The ambition of this paper is twofold: to provide a preliminary general outlook on the “culture” of digital activities, and to provoke deeper reflection on that “culture.” Theories about onlineactivities appear as scattered as the activities themselves are diverse. Social science, for instance, (^)

does focus on online user practices, but mostly from a specific perspectiveinteraction through digital media; the effects of Information and Communication Technologies on.^1 the nature of social (^)  
education, happiness, or cognitive functioning; content analyses of online communications; etcetera. Philosophy of technology provides several general frameworks for the study of (^)  
technological mediation^2 , yet without paying extensive attention to what users _do_ online. Cultural  
critique addresses certain phenomena such as blogging, file sharing, or social networking sitesbut for the most part fails to escape a bias pro or contra digital technology. Now can’t we^3 , (^)  
combine a focus on user practices, philosophical breadth, and unbiased cultural observation?  
Perhaps there is some unity to be found in all our diverse activities, residing in a digital“culture”? By broadening our perspective, in comparing online practices with collecting cultures, (^)  
we might be able to start indicating this unity. But then, if this indication makes sense, what could  
it tell us about the underlying motives of our digital behavior? In suggesting a few lines ofthought, we hope to kindle further study of online culture in the broad sense.  
For the purpose of broadening our view, we will exploit the power of analogy as much aspossible. Could we fruitfully apply a collector’s point of view to the user of digital media? At (^)  
least one collector himself hints at this possibility, detecting a decline in collecting activities  
among the young people of today. Yet, although they are less attracted to “traditional” collecting,namely of “real,” touchable objects, “\[m\]uch of their collecting ... has gone into Facebook or the (^)  
iPod, all the platforms for compiling countless (digital) objects, carefully arranged in categories  
and containers just like any collection” (King 2008, p.151). These collections seem as muchgathered, arranged, labored on and looked at as your average stamp collection.  
To put our hypothesis to the test, we turn to several writings on collecting. Collecting practices  
have been studied from various viewpoints – philosophical, psychological, social-economical,  
and anthropological-historical. Our approach will thus, by necessity, be somewhat eclectic. Theargument consists of two main parts; in each we first consult the existing literature on (^)  
“traditional” collecting, and then apply these findings to online activities. The first part of the  
paper outlines a “culture” of online “collecting” practices. First we describe some defining traitsof collecting and collections. Then we discuss relevant online practices and draw comparisons to (^)  
the found traits. In the second part of the paper, we develop a reflection on the deeper motivations  
underlying this “culture.” Here we first outline a concise overview of the theories concerning theunderlying causes of and reasons for “traditional” collecting. Then we attempt to better (^)  
understand the use of digital media from the perspective of these same motivations: first, by  
discussing some crucial divergences between “traditional” collecting and digital “collecting,” andthen, by applying “traditional” explanations to digital “collecting,” and working out some of the (^)  
consequences that this application entails.  
**What Is Collecting?**  
Exactly defining the collecting process for once and for all seems impossible. as varied as the many authors who have analyzed the phenomenon. We list several of them here:The definitions are

- “the process of actively, selectively, and passionately acquiring and possessing things  
    removed from ordinary use and perceived as part of a set of non-identical objects orexperiences” (Belk 2001, p.67)
- “the selecting, gathering, and keeping of objects of subjective value” (Muensterberger  
    1994, p.4)
- “x times (going there + taking + bringing back)”; “bringing together and beholding”  
    (Sommer 2002, p.208, 8)

- “a philosophical project, ... an attempt to make sense of the multiplicity and chaos of the  
    world” (Blom 2002, p.45)  
    The diversity of these definitions is reflected in the answers to the questions as to what can be

collected, and who collects. experiences, for example relating to travels or relationships; some people “collect” sexual _What_ can be collected? Collected things can be objects but also (^)  
partners (Belk 2001, p.66). But even scientific and educational disciplines have been in the“business” of collecting, namely the collecting of experience, knowledge, and facts. The student (^)  
gathers knowledge, Walter Benjamin remarks (1983, p.278). In the end, we even collect  
ourselves, Manfred Sommer proposes, not only in the sense of “regaining ourselves” or“focusing,” but also “in time” (2002, p.124-126).  
And population collects something (1995, p.vii). But it seems that many more people in some way or _who_ collects? According to Susan M. Pearce, about one-third of the North American (^)  
an other pursue collecting-like activities. Paul Martin claims that nearly everyone engages in  
‘unconscious collecting,’ i.e., the storing of things, for example, in Tupperware containers (1999,p.53-54). In a faint sense, everyone is a collector. As William Davies King observes: “Experience (^)  
makes for story, and stories pile up in memory” (2008, p.161).  
Thus, collecting practices can be defined either very specifically – i.e., rigidly – or very generally

- i.e., vaguely. For our purposes neither way will be quite constructive. We are in need of a

heuristic tool to probe the degree Therefore we attempt to list some formal traits every collection or collector exhibits: actions into which online practices resemble collecting activities. (^)  
which every collector, however idiosyncratically, engages. We distinguish between selecting,  
ordering, looking, accumulating and constructing.  
Selecting  
Selection lies at the heart of collecting (Pearce 1995, p.23): not just the picking out of objects, but  
also assigning certain values to them and investing them with meaning. This implicates or relatesto search: finding or trying to find. Thus Walter Benjamin describes collectors as people with a (^)  
precise tactical instinct (1983, p.274; 1999, p.64). A collector must indulge in the hunt. Yet,  
bringing together one’s collection can also simply imply waiting (King 2008, p.28; Stewart 1993,p.166).  
Selecting an object for collection mostly means lifting it out of the sphere of everydayfunctionality. According to Jean Baudrillard, every object has two potential purposes: being used (^)  
and being possessed. When an object is detached from its practical function – becomes  
subjective, abstract, ‘pure possession’ – it can be included in a collection (2005, p.91-92).Benjamin draws a similar distinction: collected objects belong to the realm of _Vollständigkeit_ , (^)  
opposed to that of the functional (1983, p.271).  
Ordering  
Selecting has its necessary counterpart in ordering: arranging, organizing, structuring. First of allin space. Russell W. Belk defines a collection as a ‘set of things,’ comparing it to a photo album (^)  
(2001, Not so much the objects themselves as the relations among them, i.e., the order one imposes onp.66, 152), in which we intentionally sort pictures according to a self-produced scheme. (^)  
the objects, constitute the collection, Susan Stewart says (1993, p.155). Form matters more than  
content (Pearce 1995, p.279).

Yet the designated order of a collection may stand in a paradoxical relation to perceived Benjamin asks: “... what else is this collection but a disorder to which habit has accommodated _dis_ order. (^)  
itself to such an extent that it can appear as order?” (1999, p.62). Indeed, an outsider observing acollection could recognize none of the order the collector puts or “sees” in it. To the “neutral” (^)  
eye, only chaos appears.  
Order also has a temporal aspect to it. According to Stewart, collections are structured not only  
through space but through time as well. Chronologically, she says, collectors superimpose  
personal time over social time, autobiography over history, thereby creating “a fiction of theindividual life” (Stewart 1993, p.155).  
Looking  
Most collections are to be seen and admired. Naturally the collector him- or herself takes  
precedence over (Muensterberger 1994, p.235). As we’ve seen, collected objects escape the sphere of usefulness.other possible audiences. “\[E\]very collector has a hungry eye ...” (^)  
Instead the collector “... studies and loves them as the scene, the stage, of their fate,” Benjamin  
explains poetically (1999, p.62). Likewise, Stewart describes the collection as “... the totalaestheticization of use value” (1993, p.151). According to Sommer, finally, the collecting process (^)  
originates in “... the desire for the lasting presence of all wonderful things, the seeing of which  
makes us happy” (2002, p.12).  
Accumulating  
Tritely put, collectors always want more. They gather, and keep. “What has been brought together  
in a collection, must stay put” (Sommer 2002, p.213). From there on, collections mostly growcontinually. “One cannot but wonder whether collections are in fact meant to be completed, ...” (^)  
Baudrillard asks (2005, p.99). Yet “growth” can also be qualitative. As Belk observes, some  
collectors focus rather on ‘upgrading’ their collection than on expanding it (2001, p.66).Expanding collectors accumulate literally, updating collectors keep the size of their collection (^)  
(possibly even consisting of just one piece) constant, replacing and discarding an object when  
they find a better specimen.  
Constructing  
One last feature summons up the first four, but should be mentioned to complete our sketch.  
Collecting can appear as a witless, mechanical pastime. Yet it entails much more than _mere_  
selecting, ordering, looking, and accumulating. “\[C\]ollecting is an act of production as well asconsumption (Belk 1995, p.55). It’s an act of creation, of construction, in its own right.  
King compares collecting to artistic practice (2008, they are performed,” he says (2008, p.43). According to Pearce, the collector structures his or herp.126). “Collections are not merely owned, (^)  
collection by way of metaphors that he or she consciously chooses: for example, the idea thatthings of similar shape or color belong together (1995, p.183). Essential to this structuring is the (^)  
giving of names; it attests to the fact that collecting constructs and not only copies the material  
world.  
According to Benjamin, again more philosophically, what propels a collector to go find and seize  
new objects every time is the deep desire “\[t\]o renew the old world ...” (1999, p.63). In fact, Paul

Martin suggests that the collector’s creation can “... in its extremity become a reality” (1999,p.35).

Summary: Collecting as “Way of Doing”

As we’ve suggested, an exact definition of collecting seems hard to come by. We thereforepropose to “define” collecting as a “way of doing” that can be situated and exteriorated in many (^)  
different contexts, with many different people and objects, and in various forms, but always  
exhibiting all of the above five traits: selecting, ordering, looking, accumulating, andconstructing. This gives us ample room to apply the collecting “model” to the most diverse online (^)  
practices, while still preserving enough theoretical relevance to make sense of these practices as  
“collecting processes.” To the first task we now turn.  
**Online “Collecting” Practices**  
Do our online activities resemble the collector’s “way of doing”? To demonstrate they do, we  
first discuss the five aforementioned characteristics in relation to Information and  
Communication Technologies (or digital media) generally. Then we categories of online activity, linking the same traits to each more specifically and concisely. Webriefly list a few of the main (^)  
will notice, then, that most online “collections” vary on an axis of knowingness with which the  
user indulges in a “collecting” practice.  
Broadly speaking, most, if not all, of our digital doings consist of selecting: “locating” and“clicking.” Mostly, as in “traditional” collecting, some kind of search – e.g., a Google search, or (^)  
skimming a webpage – precedes this selection. Likewise, the “search” can take the form of  
“waiting,” although waiting times during Internet use are nowadays reduced to a minimum thanksto high-speed connections. The wait is more for other people to react (answer an e-mail, post a (^)  
comment, ...), or for appropriate situations to arise (the putting online of certain content) – much,  
actually, as in “traditional” collecting. And, to be sure, often these “quests” and expectancies doserve a non-functional goal (with the exception of strictly business-related communication or (^)  
activities).  
Also organizing and ordering can be detected everywhere in our online “worlds.” Contact lists,  
personal profiles, mailboxes, ... are just as much constructed through time and space as classic  
collections.,although “space” is a tricky concept online andwe will return to this issue in the lastsection. Yet we necessarily find ourselves in “places” as soon as we start “browsing,” looking for (^)  
something – we know _where_ to look – or sending something _to_ someone. Online structures (e.g.,  
Facebook profiles) are, of course, partly self-designed, partly imposed “from above.” But so arephoto albums, ready-made stamp albums, cupboards and jars, in which reigns still enough (^)  
freedom for individual expression.  
Then, looking. Obviously, much online material attracts the eye. We’ve come a long way since  
the purely textual interfaces of the first personal computers. More than ever, not only equipmentis made to impress, but software and websites too get designed accordingly – e.g., by using (^)  
Adobe Flash to create stunning interactive graphics. We ourselves have a hand in that as well.  
Deliberately, though often unconsciously, we filter the “material” we put online – e.g., on ourpersonal profiles – according to aesthetic principles, showing only what we want to show. In a (^)  
quite literal way, online life is in the eye of the beholder.

In a very general sense, accumulating seems a very crucial dynamic in digital media. The Web,for instance, grows bigger every second. But also our online profiles, photo collections, and (^)  
mailboxes never quite reach a finishing point. Yet at the same time we substitute – i.e., overwrite– much information too: we change profile pictures, erase MP3s to replace them with others, or (^)  
delete mails to keep our inboxes relevant. Thus we not only expand, but also upgrade. (And,  
naturally, every piece of hard- or software calls for an update now and then.)  
Finally, that construction is part and parcel of our online activities, sounds like a trivial  
suggestion. So much has the Internet been hailed as an emancipating tool, turning passiveconsumers into active producers. Surely the Web is a great deal about consuming nowadays, but (^)  
the main message still holds, as for example “user-generated content” exemplifies. Our online  
lives consist of countless creative, constructive activities, even if those activities limit themselvesto the choosing, picking, and “posting” of other people’s creations (e.g., posting YouTube videos (^)  
on Facebook profiles) – exactly as collectors often do.  
So much for the general outlook; we now list several classes of online activities and point out  
how our five collecting traits apply to them.  
Social Networking Services  
The use of Social Networking Sites (SNS) has risen dramatically during the last couple of years.As of October 2009, Wikipedia lists 164 of them (Anon. 2009), with Facebook, MySpace, and (^)  
Qzone (in Chinese) as undisputed toppers. SNS profiles can very well be depicted as interactivecollections. Users bring together all sorts of data – personal information; pictures and videos; (^)  
links to favorite movies, music, books; affiliations – and structure these in a more or less prefab  
spatial pattern, i.e., the layout of the profile (which some sites grant more room to modify thanothers). In time they thereby also constitute, one could say, ‘a fiction of the individual life’ (^)  
(Stewart 1993, p.155), as research on digital identities has suggested. Obviously, profiles are  
meant and made to be watched, by ourselves and our “friends,” but even by complete strangers,depending on privacy settings. “Friends” or contacts, then, also get ordered and organized in (^)  
categories, by alphabet, by importance – and they just as well wind up in the accumulating  
dynamic that characterizes SNS profiles: a profile is never “finished”; not even the amount ofcontacts ever stays constant. In sum, SNS can be characterized as collective, constructive (^)  
collecting efforts, displaying all of the above traits.  
Online Music and Image Services  
Though many online music and image services are conceived as SNS – such as Last.fm andFlickr – they deserve a special mention, because they resemble “traditional” collections quite (^)  
directly. Photo sites like Picasaweb and Photobucket, video sites like YouTube, peer-to-peer  
services like BitTorrent, or web hosting companies such as RapidShare very much take the placethat was once monolithically occupied by photo albums, record and VHS collections, but now (^)  
with greater transferability and shareability – pending legal issues and discussions concerningauthors’ rights notwithstanding. Although some of these sites do not offer the communication and (^)  
profiling capacities of SNS, by and far the same observations hold here. Yet more than with SNS  
– mostly centered on personal profiles – these services tend to constitute “worldwide” datacollections, growing exorbitantly every minute due to the possibility of adding “user-generated (^)  
content.”  
Blogging and Website Design

Although, here too, blogging and microblogging (e.g., Twitter) are components or even crucial

aspects of many SNS, we mention them separately. For blogging, and maintaining a website, areakin to collecting in the broad sense that writing in general and diary writing specifically have (^)  
always been forms of collecting. Benjamin, for instance, remarks that the foremost way of  
acquiring books is to write them oneself (1999, p.63). Conversely, King avers that to write a life” (2008, p.38). “\[t\]o collect is  
E-mailing and Chatting  
We might not always consciously perceive it, but E-mailboxes are full-blown databases of our  
communicative and social lives. They often offer a retrospective archive of what we’ve said anddone at this or that time, to a greater or lesser degree ordered (folder tree structures, filters, rules, (^)  
et cetera), but always easily searchable and manageable. Thus they constitute a collection mostly  
without the user or mailer deliberately striving for it; this is an important observation to which wewill return shortly.  
Virtual worlds  
However less obvious as “collecting” practice, virtual worlds – such as MUDs (Multi User  
Dungeons) – do fit the scheme we’ve outlined: one can select and sculpture one’s personage,structure and organize a private space, expand one’s boundaries – literally and figuratively – and (^)  
store all these parameters into the database of the website proprietor. In so far as it’s possible tocollect experiences, the severely controllable environments of online worlds surely count as (^)  
collections of “second lives.” And as Martin reminds us, such a construction can “... in its  
extremity become a reality” (1999, p.35).  
Bookmarking and Bots  
The individual user practice of bookmarking – browser “favorites,” for example – doesn’t ask for  
much elaboration. But lately online variants of bookmarking have surfaced that fully employ the  
sharing power of Social Networking: Digg, Delicious, StumbleUpon, ... These websites make itpossible to rate, vote for, categorize, or comment on (the content of) other sites. They are based (^)  
on the concept of ‘crowdsourcing’ – the outsourcing of a task to a large group of people, usually  
through the Internet, thus gathering a lot of small efforts to make for a big result. In a generalway, these sorts of information-assembling applications stand for a more “human” approach to (^)  
Web search that takes into account content and meaning of information. Search engines such as  
Google, by contrast, have been performing searches up until now based purely on formal rules,“automatically,” i.e., by way of search bots that crawl the Internet, however also to literally (^)  
collect, select, and then arrange data according to a ranking algorithm. (We will return to this in  
the paragraph about ‘The Semantic Web.’) What’s interesting is that these more or lessautomatic, more or less conscious mechanisms lead up to, again, a “worldwide” collection of (^)  
collections, generated and called upon in an instant.  
Online Shopping  
E-commerce – be it firsthand or secondhand – establishes a form of online “collecting” just as  
well. Obviously each store, hardware or software, can be seen as an accumulation of goods; but  
that doesn’t make it a collection. What brings e-stores nearer to collections are the interactivetechniques they employ to exploit customers’ online actions and behavior and to enrich their (^)

visible content and commercial strategy. Take, for example, the purchase advice offered byAmazon.com: ‘More Items to Consider,’ ‘Related to Items You’ve Viewed,’ ‘Inspired by Your (^)  
Browsing History,’ all based on the items at which you’ve looked; ‘Customers Who Viewed ThisItem also Looked at,’ ‘Customers with Similar Searches Purchased,’ based on other people’s (^)  
actions. But not only that, customers get the opportunity to deliberately rate products or write  
reviews about them. A store thereby becomes more than simply a store, namely, a publicly –willingly or not – organized arsenal of information and offerings. Here we must again call into (^)  
mind Baudrillard’s and Benjamin’s conviction that the collected object escapes the purely  
functional sphere: user input – though it can be criticized as a commercial abuse of free consumerlabor – links up countless “lived experiences” with commodities, personalizing and (^)  
decommodifying the latter in a sense.  
The Semantic Web  
The emerging developments around the Semantic Web, finally, take this sort of collectingparadigm a step further. Semantic Web applications not only store and transfer information, but (^)  
also endeavor to specify its meaning, i.e., semantics. Such applications would be in a way “self-  
understanding,” and this should enable hardware and software agents to better handle Webcontent. The structural manipulation of information in accordance with its meaning, formerly left (^)  
mainly to human users in the case of bookmarking or e-shopping, would thus be dealt with by  
intelligent, “interpreting” algorithms. They would combine the high efficiency of automatization,exemplified by search bots, with meaningful data handling and structuring. The “collecting” (^)  
process thereby becomes largely unconscious to the Web user.  
Digital “Collections”: Conscious and Unconscious; Offline and Online  
As we’ve seen, online practices exhibit to a fairly great extent each of the five aforementioned  
traits of collecting. But additionally we’ve detected an axis, or spectrum, on which these practices  
can be situated: the relative knowingness with which users “collect”-- that is, consciously select,order, look or make available for looking, accumulate, and construct. Sometimes the computer (^)  
code just takes over these tasks. Thus, from SNS as highly personally structured “collections,” to  
the Semantic Web as a “self-collecting” digital organism, the degree in which we consciously andwillingly “collect” varies.  
Another point we need to make, before turning to in the second part of this paper, is that the sort of digital “collections” we’ve talked about needn’ttake up the topic of motivations for collecting (^)  
necessarily be _on_ line. In fact the list of contacts on our mobile phones or PDAs, the music on our  
mp3 players (as King already suggested), the data on our hard disks, are all forms of digital,albeit offline, “collecting,” only less shareable than their online variants.  
**The Meaning of Collecting**  
Many of the quoted theorists have tried to explain collecting, or at least to understand it better.And just as an exact definition of collecting can scarcely be found, we mustn’t expect only one (^)  
“explanation” for collecting either. In what follows, we outline several explicatory models,  
ranging from the psychological, through the philosophical and anthropological, to the social-economical, that try to unravel the reasons for, causes of, or motives for collecting.

‘Extended Self’

According to of an ‘extended self’ (1988, 2001). What’s more, we genuinely experience them as part and Belk, our possessions, and specifically our collections, can be looked upon as parts (^)  
parcel of our selves. We abruptly notice how strong this attachment can bewhen we fall victim to  
a fire or theft. Collected objects furnish us with the possibility of enlarging our sense of self, butin a constructive way: “... unlike arms and legs, the choice and assembly of objects to form a (^)  
collection is ostensibly a self-expressive creative act that tells us something about the collector”  
(2001, p.89). Collections say things about us we would not dare to say aloud. And, importantlyand consequently, the desire to complete a collection matches the wish to complete oneself.  
Objects for Humans  
Some theorists, mainly relying on psychoanalytical concepts, have analyzed the collecting  
process as a turning away from human relationships. Baudrillard (2005, p.91-114), for one, linkscollecting to sexuality. He sees collecting as a regression, as a fleeing back behind the genital (^)  
sexuality. “Real,” human relationships are threatening. Collected objects, on the contrary, harbor  
a safe, conflict-free haven, because they are sexless. Yet, although collecting is a regressive,infantile act, it at least prevents one from further regression into total delusion ( p.114).  
Werner Muensterberger (1994) develops an analogous but distinct line of thought. According tohim, the urge to collect originates in a – mostly unconscious – memory of a loss, deprivation or (^)  
vulnerability, and a consequential desire for substitution. Collected objects fulfill the samepurpose as “transitional objects” for young children. A blanket or a toy, for example, substitutes (^)  
for the mother object and thus compensates for its absence, “... evidently aiding the illusion not  
only of being protected but also, quite literally, in touch” ( p.253). As such, the collector collectssubstitutes for the primary mother object ( p.44). But more than with Baudrillard, this practice (^)  
definitely has an upside. As a coping mechanism, an effort to re-stabilize the ego, and a means of  
countering loss, collecting is “... by no means an unhealthy ego defense” ( p.252).  
Still, collections can also substitute for humans in a fully positive way, namely when we “make”  
human beings of them. We anthropomorphize objects, “... so that a person-thing relationshipbecomes a person-person relationship” (Belk 2001, p.76). King puts it poetically: “Possessing a (^)  
new object feels like learning something or meeting someone, and there is happiness in that”  
(2008, p.42). Sometimes collectors even have the feeling they are “rescuing” the items theyacquire (Benjamin 1999, p.65-66).  
Infatuation  
A related, but quite different explanation is framed in terms of passion and emotion. Thus, for  
Benjamin, collecting is a passion, fraught with memory (1999, Baudrillard, collected objects lifted out of the sphere of use value enter the “passionatep.61-62). According to (^)  
abstractness of possession” (2005, p.92). Belk avers that collecting is a highly engaging,passionate form of consumption (2001, p.66). Also Pearce and Martin describe the collecting (^)  
process as both emotionally involving and psychically energizing (Martin 1999, p.46; Pearce  
1995, p.221).  
More specifically, collecting can be said to resemble infatuation and romantic love.  
Muensterberger identifies attachment to one’s collection with the over-evaluation observedamong young lovers (1994, p.230). Belk writes: “Perhaps the best analogy for this kind of (^)

behavior is ... romantic love” (2001, p.148). Yet, as being in love can bring the greatesthappiness, it can also cause the most dreadful pain: “... passion involves suffering, and collecting (^)  
is no exception” (p.149). Mostly this suffering takes the form of guilt. Feelings of guilt can ariseout of the “economic” activity of purchasing – spending money on “nonuseful” items purely for (^)  
individual reasons. But they can just as well originate in the narcissistic urges and pride a  
collector experiences (Muensterberger 1994, p.53).  
Reviving the Past  
Our collections help us remember; they are a “memory standing outside the self” (Stewart 1993,  
p.133). According to Benjamin collecting is a form of practical remembrance (1983, p.271). Not  
only does a collector recall the context of the acquisition of an object, he says, his “memory”includes the details surrounding the item as well: former ownership, place of origin, category, ... (^)  
All this “past” comes together in the collector’s collection. Pearce sees a collection as a product  
of an individual life, and as a means to structure that life. Moreover, collections, or morespecifically acquisitions, can serve as rites of passage (1995, p.235-236).  
Remembrance, when cultivated, can take the form of nostalgia. Souvenirs can establish contactwith a past time, “... and at the social as well as the philosophical level this is of great significance (^)  
to modern people for whom a feeling of rootlessness becomes increasingly oppressive ...” (Pearce  
1995, p.244). Martin agrees, mentioning nostalgia as a defense mechanism against the growinginsecurity of a market-ruled, “spectacle-driven” society that gains speed everyday (1999, p.96).  
Assuring the Future  
Collecting can also help to establish a future. By force of its creative character, it can open upunforeseen possibilities: “Collecting, it appears, is not just a time one can pass through, it is also, (^)  
in itself, a pass which time can open out” (Pearce 1995, p.239). Through collecting one can  
discover, decide, and change course.  
On a more metaphysical plane, collecting can be seen as an “opening up” of the future. Stewart,  
unlike Pearce, opposes the collected object to the souvenir. Whereas the souvenir is an attempt torevive the past, to focus on the past, the collection is all about forgetting, and putting the past in (^)  
the service of the collection. Comparing the collection to Noah’s Ark, Stewartsays: “The world of  
the ark is a world not of nostalgia but of anticipation” (1993, p.152). For Benjamin, likewise, theacquiring of a book, by a book collector, constitutes the rebirth of that book. It brings about a (^)  
renewal of the world (1999, p.63).  
There is, however, a somewhat darker aspect to this. According to Baudrillard, objects give us the  
possibility of “controlling” time, i.e., denying it in a sense. “\[T\]he organization of the collection  
itself replaces timeirreversibility of time. The endless ‘series’ of the collection, and the fact that it’s never finished,” (2005, p.102). More precisely: by collecting we try to counter the (^)  
creates cyclical time and so replaces the irreversible time that rushes from birth to death. “\[I\]f thefunction of dreams is to ensure the continuity of sleep, that of objects ... is to ensure the (^)  
continuity of life” (p.105).  
In more practical and everyday terms, this may mean that a collection lives on even after its  
collector has died. Thus it can just as well be a sort of “insurance” against dying – “I will survive  
in the form of...” – or at least a way of coming to terms with one’s own death (Pearce 1995,p.248-250).

Telling a Life Story  
Nostalgia and remembrance have a narrative aspect. Martin stresses the story-telling capacity of  
objects and collected items (1999, p.2). Mieke Bal identifies collecting with a story, “... and

everyone needs to tell it.” (Bal 1994, p.103). Pearce explains how collections are “... essentially anarrative of experience ...” (1995, p.412). And King once again puts it succinctly when he says: (^)  
“To collect is to write a life” (2008, p.38). That means collecting contains an aspect of fabricating  
and fantasizing too. As Stewart notes, the narrative isn’t about the object, but about the owner.“\[T\]he economy of collecting is a fantastic one ...” (1993, p.158). Through our collections, we not (^)  
only remember what really happened, we also experience, “relive” what could have happened,  
but did not.  
A Subversive Effort  
From a social-economical viewpoint, collecting can be analyzed as an act of subversion: an  
attempt to reject the world of accepted material values (Pearce 1995, p.188-189). In a world filled  
with commodities that constantly pushes us to go through the cycle of first consuming and thendiscarding, a “conservative” effort like collecting can help to make a statement.  
Martin (1999) specifically examines collecting as a “societal coping mechanism,” as a search forsecurity and identity in an increasingly fluid, changing and vaguely defined society. Martin traces (^)  
the upsurge of recent (end of the 1990s) popular collecting back to the growing instability oflabor-related and social contexts during the last decades of the twentieth century.  
Belk, however, places the practice of collecting straight in the middle of consumerist society. Notonly did collecting come to full fruition together with industrialist, modern capitalist society, “... (^)  
collecting is the essence of materialism” (2001, p.viii). It not only copies the characteristics of  
consumerism, it radicalizes them too. “\[C\]ollecting is consumption writ large” ( p.1). That’s notto say that it represents a dumb acquiescence of capitalism. “The heroic collector is also engaged (^)  
in a struggle against conspicuous waste” ( p.150). Thus, as much as collectors rebel, they also  
imitate and even “practice” market-related skills.  
Magic and Sacredness  
A good many theorists point out how collecting practices verge on the magical and sacred. King,  
for one, considers the collector a throwback to times when objects were seen as animated (2008,  
p.32). Martin notes how “\[t\]he collection is the realization of dream-time” (1999, p.19). Benjaminsimilarly remarks that the collector experiences “a piece of dream life,” where everything flows (^)  
and all perception concerns _us_ (1983, p.272). From a more historical viewpoint, Belk detects a  
gradual evolution of the form of ‘the sacred’ in Western society: “... from religion to non-commercial objects of art and nature to commercial branded objects ...” (2001, p.21). He claims  
that we cannot understand the meaning of our possessions as long as we don’t try to capture theirmagic. In fact, he avers, the term ‘true collector’ is the secular equivalent of ‘true believer.’ (^)  
Stewart, also, observes the work of the consumer to be “a labor of total magic” (1993, p.164).  
Pearce (1995) investigates the relation between collected objects and magic a little more deeply.  
Collecting goes way back, in fact, to the hoards and graves of our ancestors. Objects have always  
had a sacred power, constituting a bond between our world and the realm of the dead or the gods.Purchasing or acquiring an item retains the magic that objects used to contain in former times. (^)

Likewise, Benjamin sketches the collecting process as an attempt to fix objects inside a _Bannkreis_ , a magic circle; the collection becomes a “magical encyclopedia,” and the collector a (^)  
sort of fortuneteller or them, into their distance (1983, p.274-275; 1991, p.389; 1999, p.62). _Schicksaldeuter_ , who, when looking at his objects, appears to gaze through  
Our ‘Materially Attuned Mindset’  
As we’ve just seen, Pearce (1995) traces back collecting to its ancient origins. Yet not only did  
we keep our magical relation with objects alive; we – Europeans – also have a history that’s madeus especially attentive to the material world, furnishing us with a “mindset materially attuned.” (^)  
According to Pearce, this originates in the oath-ordeal-distinction so crucial to our ancestors, that  
led us in turn to strong notions of individualism and individual rights, a sharp dichotomy betweenman and outward things, the perceiving of objects in emotional and sacred terms, and at last the (^)  
concepts of romantic love and the free choice of marital partners, all pushing us to a life  
concentrated on the acquisition of material objects. Material objects are seen to have atransforming power: they bring about profit, prestige, social authority, emotional power, (^)  
knowledge, and, as mentioned, they establish a bridge between this and ‘the other’ world.  
Thus, we have always lived close to our objects, in more than one sense – the roots of our  
materialist attitude do not simply reside in capitalist consumerism, rather, consumer society  
_accentuates_ tried to understand our world our relation with objects instead of causing it (Martin 1999, p.48). We have always _through_ material substance, as the workings of science and industry (^)  
demonstrate. Every collection, too, follows that tradition of looking at our social and materialsurroundings with a calculating eye, and so (re)asserting ourselves. What’s more, Pearce’s (^)  
thorough study shows that collecting attitudes elude the boundaries of class and gender: in the  
world of collecting, we all react to objects in the same way – though each with an idiosyncratictwist. It appears that we collect as a way of life: collections aren’t in us, we are in them, as also (^)  
Benjamin remarks (1999, p.69; although he tends to mention the opposite in 1983, p.273). We  
live with, in, and by them.  
**Online vs. “Traditional” Collecting**  
Thus far we’ve listed some explanations and motivations for “traditional” collecting. Can we  
constructively apply these to online “collecting”? We will immediately argue we can. But before  
we do so, we have to tackle one obstacle that stands in the way of an alltoo-easy analogy. In“traditional” collecting we gather material things – things that can be touched – whereas in the (^)  
digital realm “objects” stay, by necessity, “virtual.” In this section we elaborate briefly on three  
issues related to the materiality, or immateriality, of collected objects: can one really collect“untouchable,” i.e., virtual goods? What is then left of the “hunt,” once so crucial to “traditional” (^)  
collecting? And, lastly, how far does this immateriality touch on the social aspect of online  
“collecting”?  
Can One Collect “Untouchable” Goods?  
All “traditionally” collected things – coins, stamps, statuettes, books, ... – seem to have at least  
one feature in common: they can be touched and handled; they take up “real” space; they aresolid. This “touchability” undoubtedly plays a significant role in much collecting. Sommer (^)  
describes the collecting practice as “... move by foot, _grasp_ by hands” (2002, p.209). Moreover,  
the feeling, caressing, fumbling, and arranging of one’s collected items can provide for great

pleasure. Also, the touching of objects may elicit or contribute to the magical powers expectedfrom them (Stewart 1993, p.139).

According to Martin, recent popular collecting could be partly a reaction to the digital revolution.  
“The never-never land of cyberspace provides a digital alternative environment for the individual

while collecting offers a tactile one” (1999, p.32). Whereas the digital lets us play with differentidentities, collecting is a means to re-conquer a lost identity, or one from the past, he says. While (^)  
the information age demands us to renew our identities all the time, thereby uprooting us, objects  
_are_ ourselves in the third person, according to Martin.. They give us shelter in the safety of the past. Collectingthus forms a way of speaking of  
Yet there are reasons, first, not to regard “touchability” as an essential characteristic of collectingand, second, not to analyze digital technology as the archenemy of fixed or past identities. First, (^)  
even in “traditional” collecting, touching the object doesn’t need to be a priority. A record  
collection, for example, obviously takes up space, and consists of specific objects – particularpressings, special or first releases, signed sleeves, ... But although its collector may not buy the (^)  
albums mainly to listen to them, the music itself surely accounts for much of the attraction. Quite  
the same goes for collections be touched as to be seen. Here another quality than tactility takes the fore. Moreover, a status of, for instance, of figurines or plates, that are not so much meant to (^)  
“untouchability” can just as well suggest magical forces at play. Why would an untouchable  
collection be less real?  
Second, counterposing digital technology to tactile objects, with the first enhancing multipleidentities and the latter keeping us grounded in a stable context, seems to be less and less (^)  
reasonable these days. Disregarding identity theft and abuse, the “Web 2.0” – the Web of social  
networking, blogging, and “user-generated content” – invites us more and more to “revealourselves,” to show ourselves “as we are,” and to maybe take on multiple identities, but in a way (^)  
not remarkably different from what we do in “real” social life, where we are also never “one”  
person. The anonymity of early mainstream Internet has largely given way to a desire of definingourselves completely.  
What Is Left of the “Hunt” in Digital “Collecting”?  
Another issue, closely related to the previous one, touches on a component of collecting Walter  
Benjamin enthusiastically describes: the hunt. The worthwhile, and it adds to a sense of success and accomplishment (Belk 2001, p.92-93). The“thrill of the hunt” can make collecting (^)  
hunt, in a sense, relates to magic too: “Finding something feels like a miracle, confirmation that  
the world is providential” (King 2008, p.112). Pearce (1995), again, unlocks the historical rootsof our hunting instinct. According to her, the hunt of the collector originates in the oath-ordeal (^)  
scheme forming the base of our world view, with ordeal – the challenge to be faced and overcome

- eventually taking the shape of the quest, of the hunt.

Hunting has an essentialvirtual world Second Life, an avatar (the user’s visual representation) can move “by foot,” or byly spatial aspect to it. Yet how do we go about moving digitally? In the (^)  
transportation means such as cars or helicopters, but it can also simply be “teleported” to  
wherever in the online world. If we “collect” online, surely the hunt must be much less thrilling.Then again, maybe our ordeals have been displaced to the level of “profiling.” Not only profiling (^)  
ourselves – in the case of “exhibiting” ourselves on social networking sites – but also, and maybe  
more, the profiling, scanning, and testing of information: “Is this real?”; “Do I need to knowanything more about it?”; “Do I have the right version?”; “Will this work?”. The installing of (^)

software, or the arranging of a web page, for example, can challenge us, trivially but noticeably,too. Perhaps the immense amount of FAQ pages, forums, and support sites on the Web testifies to (^)  
a new, “postmodern” sort of hunt: the quest to “get this thing working.” Certainly we still have alot of work to do to get our online “collections” going. Moreover, we should keep in mind that (^)  
troubles, difficulties, obstacles, and barriers have a meaning of their own: they must be battled,  
crossed, defeated.  
Collecting Together, Collecting Each Other  
Collecting has “immaterialized.” Yet how does this affect the collector’s relation with “the  
others”? Collecting used to be largely a solitary activity. Belk characterizes collecting as mostly  
an individual enterprise; it is a socially sanctioned form of Pearce describes the collected object as a gift from the collector to him- or herself (1995, p.369).“selfish indulgence” (2001, p.72). (^)  
Collecting has something undoubtedly individualistic about it.  
Then again, “the others” always surround us. Although we are ‘egocentric,’ others are just as  
well, and we’re aware of that (Sommer 2002, p.187). What’s more, as even Baudrillard alleges,  
collecting can stretch out into “culture” and partly elude the pure relation between collector andcollection. The search for a desired item can make a collector reach out to friends, competitors, or (^)  
strangers for help (2005, p.113). According to Pearce, collectors are not necessarily “loners,” as  
folk psychologies sometimes depict them. Research has shown that their relationship patternslargely concur with national standards (1995, p.226). Some of them visit collectors’ clubs (^)  
regularly, although they tend to have ambivalent relations with their co-collectors, because ofcompetition ( p.231). Nevertheless, these communities sharpen collectors’ social capacities. (^)  
“Collectors are, as a rule, remarkably good at connecting or networking,” King claims (2008,  
p.77).  
So collectors are never really alone. This surely qualifies online “collecting” too, and even more.  
“Collecting digitally,” we easily connect with other people, our “co-collectors.” Just as in a club,they help us out during our quests, searches, and tasks, or they provide an audience. Does the (^)  
Web resemble a giant collector’s club? The aforementioned “crowdsourcing,” for example, looks  
a lot like a collector’s club activity. A lot of people doing a lot of small jobs – gathering data,tagging images, correcting texts – add up to a body of work, knowledge or information that never (^)  
could have been assembled by one person, just as the collector’s club total expertise exceeds the  
sum of the individual experiences of the members.  
Yet haven’t we crossed a border? The collected object is always something brought in “from  
outside,” made “ours.” As Pearce puts it: the Other, essentially different and distant, but we will turn it into sensible Sameness by“\[t\]he material available for collection comes to us from (^)  
interpreting it in the light of understood parameters” (1995, p.311). Only, ‘the Other,’ now, might  
just as well be literally “an other,” namely another networking sites and our contact databases on our mobile phones, for example, we collect other _person._ Through our “friends” list on social (^)  
humans too – not in a bodily or physical sense, obviously, but certainly in a possessive sense:there it is, black on white, “these are my friends,” and by extension, “this is me.”  
But is this a new, let alone a badwanting to be had and held, born collectible, and with a little luck we never stop being prized, thing? King, once again, observes poetically: “We are born (^)  
possessions” (2008, p.74). And as we’ve seen, collecting can resemble infatuation. In love, one  
longs to possess his or her love object, but also to life, we collect each other. Why would it be any different online?be possessed, to be an object. Even in “real”

So, we have seen that first, the “untouchability” of digital “objects,” second, the modification of

the “hunt” online, and third, the social dynamics of digital “collecting,” do not necessarily standin the way of applying explanatory models of “traditional” collecting toonline practices. But what (^)  
happens if we do so? That is the theme of the following, and final, section of this paper.  
**Understanding Online Practices through the Collecting Paradigm**  
In the have furnished: collecting as an‘extended self’; as a substitute for human contact; as passion; assection above, we’ve discussed the main explanations for collecting practices that theorists (^)  
remembrance; as anticipation; as a subversive or consuming act; as magic; or as culturally  
inherited, object-oriented behavior. With the issue of materiality now out of the way, we canfocus fullforce on the implications these explanations could entail for the comprehension of (^)  
online practices. First, we briefly point out some analogies between these explanations and  
existing research on ICT and technology. There appears much concurrence between the two; yetthe collecting paradigm gives us the opportunity to broach the subject in a more comprehensive (^)  
manner. Then, second and finally, we again pull back our focus and, by way of returning to our  
definition of collecting as a “way of doing,” sketch out an explorative framework for the study ofonline practices as a “culture.”  
Explanations of Collecting Practices vs. the Study of Technology  
How far do motivations of and reasons for collecting behavior resemble analyses already suppliedin the general domain of the study of technology, and where do lacunae appear? We briefly (^)  
elaborate on the aforementioned explanations in the same order as before.  
‘Extended Self’  
(^) philosophy of technology, extension theories have been around for quite a long time. From ErnstDo we regard our online “collections” as parts of ourselves? Do they extend our selves? In the (^)  
Kapp’s _Grundlinien einer Philosophie der Technik_ (1978), through Marshall McLuhan’s concern  
with media as narcotic enhancements (2003)distributed intelligence (Clark 1997, 2003; Hayles 1999), to recent work on embodied cognition and, technologies are defined in one way or (^)  
another as extensions (prostheses, ‘organ projections’) of human body parts, capacities, or senses.  
These theories, however, do not work out in detail the extension idea with regard to the “self,”and they don’t examine online activities, or do so only marginally. Sherry Turkle, by contrast, (^)  
analyzes computers and computer-related practices (such as participating in MUDs and chatting)  
as full parts of our social and psychological lives, and online identities as ‘second selves’ (1995,2005) – yet without employing the concept of extension. The collecting paradigm could furnish (^)  
us with an overall framework to combine extension theories with the study of digital identities.  
Objects for Humans  
Do online “collections” also substitute for humans, negatively or positively? Obviously there’s  
been some concern that online video games, virtual worlds, and even SNS make people turn away  
from “real” social contact, especially in the case of so-called “problematic computer use” or‘Internet Addiction’ (Block 2008). However, these online “places” have also been said to possess (^)  
their very own social potentialities, and to offer safe havens for interactions that would otherwise  
be nearly impossible, just as collections could shelter us from the conflict-ridden complexity ofsociality (Schroeder & Axelsson 2006; Turkle 1995). And in relation to the anthropomorphization (^)

of online “collections,” we should refer to research on the people treat computers as social actors, i.e., as real people or places (Nass, Steuer &Tauber 1994;‘media equation,’ which holds that (^)  
Reeves & Nass 1996)that in ‘alterity relations’ we interact with technology as if it was “an other” (1990, p.97-108). Lastly, Don Ihde investigating human-technology relations, has suggested.  
Infatuation  
Do we invest our digital lives with intense emotion too? Browsing SNS profiles, for example, can  
be a passionate, highly involving activity. Donald Norman, for one, has made a plea forconsidering emotion an important – if not the most important – factor in the use of technologies (^)  
and, by consequence, in technological design (2004). Can passion, love, and infatuation shed  
light on our online behavior, and how? Here a whole field for further research seems to lie open.  
Reviving the Past  
Aren’t online practices as diverse as the bookmarking of our daily occupations on Social  
Networking Sites, the preservation of ancient manuscripts by scanning them into computers, or  
the massive Google digital library project all attempting at, or resulting in the exterioration of ourmemories? In fact, applied scientific research has more than once proposed technological (^)  
remembrance as a main goal for ICT development. From Vannevar Bush’s ‘Memex’ (1945)  
through David GelernterGemmell 2007), several authors have outlined an ideal of technological remembering. Recently,’s ‘Mirror Worlds’ (1991) to Gordon Bell’s ‘MyLifeBits’ (Bell & (^)  
however, there has been a growing debate over the degree to which “eternal” remembranceshould be cherished either as a virtue (Bell & Gemmell 2009) or as a vice (Mayer-Schönberger (^)

2009. of digital technologies. The philosophical implications of these issues have only begun to  
    be investigated.  
    Assuring the Future  
    Just as we try to safeguard the past through digital “collections,” don’t we also attempt to  
    ascertain the future? As digitalization projects proliferate, we try to tackle destruction, erosion,  
    and neglect in order to preserveinformation for future generations. On an individual level, immortality’ is no utopian ambition. Already, SNS profiles “outlive” their owners; sometimes‘digital (^)  
    relatives of the deceased will keep on posting messages to the profile to keep the memory of their  
    loved ones alive, or to help themselves in their mourning process (North 2007). Web servicessuch as [http://www.legacy.com,](http://www.legacy.com%2C/) [http://www.forevernetwork.com,](http://www.forevernetwork.com%2C/) or famento.com offer the possibility of (^)  
    storing and sharing ‘life stories’ and other data, thereby creating a digital memory of oneself or  
    someone else, that would live on even after the person concerned has died.foresee thatwith the help of artificial intelligencedigital avatars could be developed that minutely Bell and Gemmell (^)  
    simulate, for instance, one’s speech patterns; conversely, one could imagine talking to an avatar  
    of one’s great-grandfather (2009, p.151ff.). On the whole, however, these are quite recentphenomena, and they should be more thoroughly studied.  
    Telling a Life Story  
    They nevertheless seamlessly link up to the narrative approach. Collectors tell a story throughtheir collections. Does this also account for digital “collections”? Narrative theory has been (^)  
    applied to communication _per se_ (Fisher 1987). But also some of the “ways of doing” we’ve  
    observed to be far exceeding communication alone have lately been connected to narrativeconcepts, e.g., virtual reality (Ryan 2001; Balet, Subsol & Torguet 2003). It goes to show that (^)

what counts here as “narrative” not only consists of textual information but also and even more soof visual expression and interaction.

A Subversive Effort

Does online activity exhibit the same curious mix of anti-hierarchical and “co-hierarchical,” i.e.,consuming behavior as collecting practices? It surely seems so: digital technologies furnish us (^)  
with utilities to undermine capitalist hierarchy and consumerist society, but at the same time  
commercial enterprises and market economy logic still dominate them. On the one hand, whatPaul Levinson calls ‘new new media’ (2009), i.e., many-to-many media – blogs, video sites, SNS (^)

- furnish minority groups with the possibility of voicing their demands or disagreement,

sometimes by simply constructing a Facebook page.on commerce, sometimes without us even noticing it. Take eBay: at face value an empowering On the other hand, digital media still thrive (^)  
tool that brings commerce, in the form of ancient barter, back “to the people,” but behind the  
scenes a company that makes profit out of the free labor done by its millions of users (showingtheir products, answering questions, packaging and sending, ...) (Lillie 2006).  
Magic and Sacredness  
Are we enchanted about our digital “objects” too? It is hard to demonstrate this practically, but  
Marshall McLuhan claims ‘electric technology’ to be a return to the conditions of the ancient orprimitive tribe: simultaneity, instantaneity, involvement, auditory-tactile ways of interacting. (^)  
“The young today live mythically and in depth” (2001, p.100). Surely instant contact through oure-mails, SMSes, and online profiles retains much of the mythical flavor of magic wands, totems, (^)  
and sorcery; and as we search through Google’s pages, we cannot but be stunned by this ‘magical  
encyclopedia’ that delivers us all we’ve asked for in just the blink of an eye. It would perhaps beinteresting to expand this theme of “electronic magic” into the general study of myth, archetype, (^)  
and sacredness.  
Our ‘Materially Attuned Mindset’  
Does our ‘materially attuned mindset’ also explain our digital “collecting,” notwithstanding theimmaterial character of the latter? Contrarily, within information science, there has been research (^)  
relating to the “thingliness” of digital entities, for instance on the general character of digital  
objects (Ekbia 2009), or on identifying them (Allison, Currall, Moss & Stuart 2005).Provocatively, Philip Zhai (1998) even claims the virtual to be as real as “reality,” with no (^)  
ontological difference between the two. The statute of the “digital thing,” undoubtedly, will keep  
on instigating future research.  
Our Online “Collecting” Culture  
As we’ve seen, explanations of collecting concur to a certain degree with existing analyses of  
technology in general or ICT. Yet just as online practices exhibit the utmost diversity, theseresearch results stay dispersed and fragmented. It is the collecting paradigm that gives us the (^)  
opportunity to approach this diverseness in a more encompassing way. That would have a series  
of consequences that, taken together, would start to make visible the contours of a frameworkwith which online practices can be comprehensively analyzed as “online culture.” As a (^)  
provocation to further research on this topic, we list four of these consequences: structural,  
methodological, practical, and ethical.

The first, and most important consequence of such an approach would be structural: theunderstanding of online practices as a “way of doing,” as a “life project.” Just as collecting means (^)  
much more than mere accumulation, online practices exceed pure communication or even socialnetworking. That is not to disparage specifically oriented research. But in a world tangled up in (^)  
technology more and more each day, we also need an overall outline of “digital activities.” As  
we’ve shown, the study ofcome to grips with this challenge. As digital environments – in the broad sense of the word, digital identities or technological memory, for example, has begun to (^)  
encompassing not only virtual worlds but also, for instance, SNS – are becoming more allround,  
refined, and multifunctional – embracing not only networking tools but also mail, video sharingservices, and search mechanisms – we need to look upon digital activity as an all-inclusive, daily (^)  
condition of life. The phenomenological concept of ‘being in the world,’ for instance, has become  
very much applicable. Conversely, we can attempt to make sense of specific issues, such as thequestion of technological remembering vs. forgetting (see above), from the general viewpoint of (^)  
digital “collecting” practices.  
Consequently, there appears to be a lot more room for methodological maneuver than formerly  
thought. That is the second consequence. Instead of approaching online practices from one or  
two of the aforementioned viewpoints, we now realize that such practices can potentially beframed in terms of _all_ of them, and at the same time. To put it in the words of Don Ihde, (^)  
technology is overdetermined (2008, p.13-14). Several factors mold technology into its eventual  
form. Likewise, online practices, just as collecting practices, have more than one meaning ororigin, and can be explained and investigated from various angles, within one overall view. That (^)  
would create openings for the most diverse multi- and interdisciplinary research. In that vein,combinations of explanations such as ‘extended self’ and ‘preservation of memory’ have been (^)  
offered by, for instance, Marshall McLuhan. But what would a blend, say, of extension theory  
and a narrative approach look like? Or could one understand the significance of “post-mortem”digital services better from the viewpoint of our ‘materially attuned mindset’ – in the sense that, (^)  
for instance, if we extend our relation with “things” into the digital realm, why not extend our  
coping with death into it just as well? Or what if we would combine a focus on emotionalattachment to digital “collections” with the concept of anthropomorphization; for example: In (^)  
being immersed in SNS, to what degree are we emotionally involved with anthropomorphized  
versions of digital “objects,” or with actual, “real” people? These and other, more complexcombinations could found various new approaches.  
The third consequenceheavily and meaningfully involved with material surroundings. If online practices exhibit a is more practical. Collecting, as noted, constitutes an immersive behavior (^)  
similar involvement with the handling of digital “things,” this could be a useful starting point for  
technological design, of hardware and software alike. Authors like Peter-Paul Verbeek (2005) andDonald Norman (1998, 2004) seem to be on a fruitful track here, linking design and technological (^)  
development to the concepts of embodied cognition and our materially attuned being-in-the-  
world. Could we ameliorate ICT by interpreting them as “collecting” technologies, namely asexhibiting the five characteristics outlined in the first part of this paper, and of which the use is (^)  
possibly grounded in one or more of the motivations for “collecting” furnished in the secondpart? And if so, should we stimulate a “collecting culture,” or, on the contrary, suppress it, albeit (^)  
in certain aspects?  
That question leads us, at last, to the fourth consequence: if online activity resembles collecting,  
how can we employ that point of view in an ethical consideration of online “culture”? We need to  
refer back here to the distinction we’ve made between “conscious” and “unconscious” online“collecting.” On the one hand, in relation to “conscious” “collecting” – i.e., collecting activities (^)

we ourselves consciously deploy (e.g., SNS profiles) – we can ask questions actually want the collecting habit dominating our online lives? What will be the repercussions onsuch as: Do we (^)  
our self-image? On the other hand, “unconscious” digital “collecting” – i.e., collecting practiceswe subscribe to but do not necessarily knowingly endorse (e.g., storage of personal data on (^)  
corporate websites) – relates to discussions on privacy, surveillance, and temporal limitations on  
data storage. And, focusing out, finally, we can also ask whether the collecting habit has notspread from the digital realm to “culture” in general: do we not live in an age of collecting? Does (^)  
our “non-online” culture perhaps long to select, order, watch, and accumulate as well? An  
ongoing “catalogization” and categorizing sprouts an array of compilations, book collections,“Top 999 of the 90s,” expositions, festivals, not to forget the ever-growing libraries of music, (^)  
videos and TV series available at stores (thanks to DVD). Did digital technology spur this  
“completionist” drift? What’s certain, digital technologies gave us great availability of, or at leasteasier access to, all sorts of cultural products. And as a collector’s career usually starts by (^)  
noticing the similarity between a couple of objects, stimulating the search for _more_ like items, we  
culture consumers perhaps feel the need to complete too, faced with “so much.” But perhaps weshould not indulge blindly our need to complete? Should we let loose sometimes, discard? “Life (^)  
marches on, while collectors trail behind, carrying a shovel and a sack,”King observes (2008,  
p.145). Maybe we should not carry our shovel and sack with us all the time.  
These are a few of the issues facing us in making sense of online ànd offline “collecting”  
practices. Collecting offers a way of orienting oneself in the world. Perhaps it can offer not onlyICT users, but also researchers a way of orienting themselves in the digital realms in which (^)  
they’re absorbed.  
**Conclusion**  
In an attempt to make sense of online behavior – mailing, surfing, listening, watching, searching,  
bookmarking, ... – in a general way, and in search for a “culture” of online practices, we’ve  
observed digital activities through the lens of collecting practices. First, they resemble each otherstructurally. Both share the characteristics of selecting, ordering, looking, accumulating, and (^)  
constructing. Second, an outline of the underlying causes of or reasons for collecting helps to put  
online activities in a new, different light: more than being just functional, communicative, orinformational means, our digital tools furnish us with ways of building ourselves an identity, (^)  
remembering our pasts, anticipating our futures, positioning ourselves towards others, and  
reacting against the establishment (however, perhaps, in vain). They provide us with meaningfulpastimes, sometimes verging on the magical, as our (Western) world view, presumably, has (^)  
always been centered on things. Notwithstanding obvious differences between “traditional” and  
online “collecting” – centering around the notion of materiality – the collecting paradigm notonly offers explanations in line with contemporary technology and media studies, but also (^)  
furnishes us with a comprehensive approach with which to understand online practices as a  
whole, as “online culture.” If “collecting” is what we do online, then this behavior surpasses merecommunication, mere networking, mere functionality: just as “traditional” collecting, then, online (^)  
“collecting” establishes a life project.
