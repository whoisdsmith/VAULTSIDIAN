## Grey-Vs-Black

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter">![](https://whoisdsmith.ctrlaltback.space/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/AE4C4F28-A849-4435-9DC9-08CDE1CC9AF5.png)</figure></div>I created a new site on my CABS domain for Mulligan. Design turned out really well, finding all our old material was not as easy. There is almost no digital footprint of our existence because life and technology was so different 20 years ago.

I wanted to create and archive the life and the bond we shared so many years ago. Thankfully my Mom was my biggest fan and kept everything after all these years. Love you Mum!

I’m about halfway done with adding all of the newsletters we released when we had management under Hearts on Fire Records.

I’m so thankful that Bob and Anetra did those for us. I don’t think I ever read any of them until this past week. Very cool to read through our lives and the updated progress back then.

I added a page to upload files to the site directly if other people would like to contribute as well.

Shit, I am the bug.
