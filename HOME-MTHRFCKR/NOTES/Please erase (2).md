# Please erase



Please erase 
all the memories I hate
All the ones that have your face
Please stay away
I don’t want to feel this way
So broken every day 
I just want to get away
But at this rate
I know nothings gonna change

Every time you call 
I’m 
Doesn’t matter what you do
I’m always there for you
And you turn your back on me
And leave me there to bleed 
Watch me as I sink
While I drown in defeat
Chasing down these drinks
Can’t escape the thoughts I think
Am I always gonna feel empty
