## Side effects of taking Vyvanse and Adderall together

Aside from increasing attention and motivation, Adderall and Vyvanse have other adverse effects. Some individuals abuse them recreationally or without a prescription. Abuse of amphetamines has negative long-term and short-term consequences, including heart attacks, diseased heart muscle, and sudden death. In addition to these adverse side effects, they can also increase the heart rate and blood pressure.

Both drugs are psychostimulants. Both Vyvanse and Adderall are approved for treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Vyvanse is also approved for treating binge eating disorder. Their active ingredients are dextroamphetamine and lisdexamfetamine. Both drugs are taken orally, usually by mouth.

Both medicines affect the body’s serotonin systems. Mixing them can result in serious side effects. If you are taking Vyvanse and Adderall together, tell your HCP about any other medications you may be taking, such as anti-depressants.

In some cases, the dose may need to be adjusted.

While VYVANSE and Adderall have similar side effects, they’re both very different in their delivery systems. VYVANSE is converted to its active form by the body’s own metabolic processes, and it takes minimal time to pass through the GI tract. This is not affected by gastric pH levels and is generally more effective in the short term. ADDERALL XR, on the other hand, is delivered through a pH-dependent system. The drug is released in the GI tract through two types of beads, one of which is immediately released, and the other type is released four hours later in the lower intestine, where the pH level is higher.

While both adderall and Vyvanse have fewer side effects, the two drugs may increase your risk of heart problems.

## Does it make sense to stack Adderall and Vyvanse?

While the wholesale price for Adderall is about $113 per bottle, the generic version is less expensive. However, Vyvanse does not have a generic version. Unlike Adderall, which is available in generic form, the price of Vyvanse will vary depending on the pharmacy and the strength. Both adderall and Vyvanse are associated with a number of side effects, and taking them together may lead to a higher price than if you take them separately.

If you take Adderall and Vyvanse regularly, you may begin to develop physical and psychological dependence on them. Sudden discontinuation of these drugs can cause withdrawal symptoms. To prevent withdrawal symptoms, it is important to reduce dosage gradually under medical supervision. In addition, there are some people who cannot safely take Adderall, and may need to use extreme caution. It is always a good idea to talk to your doctor before you begin taking either medication.

While both drugs are highly effective for treating ADHD, the combination of them can lead to unwanted side effects.

## Dosage: How much Adderall and Vyvanse should you take?

Dosage of Vyvanse (Vyvanse) and Adderall (Adderall) together is not recommended. While they work in different ways to treat ADHD, they do have some similarities. Both add-on medications have similar side effects, such as dry mouth, headache, weight loss, and insomnia. But when taken together, these medications may cause additive effects, such as high blood pressure and a rapid heartbeat. To avoid these undesirable side effects, make sure to consult with your healthcare professional before starting any new treatment plan.

Dosage of Vyvanse is typically higher than that of Adderall, since it is a stimulant. It can increase blood pressure and heart rate, putting you at risk for a heart attack, stroke, or alcohol poisoning. Additionally, both medications have sedative properties. Because they are different, people taking them together could accidentally overdose on one or the other. This could lead to severe symptoms, including chest pains and aggression.

It is important to note that VYVANSE may cause cardiac problems. It has been linked to sudden death in adults and is potentially fatal in children. It can also increase heart rate and blood pressure, so HCPs should monitor patients closely and adjust their dosages accordingly. Do not take VYVANSE more than 50 mg once daily, and consult with your doctor if you experience any of these side effects.

When to take these drugs together, it is important to follow the directions on the packaging. The immediate release version of Adderall lasts for about four to six hours. The extended-release version, however, lasts about 10 to 13 hours, while Vyvanse lasts between ten and fourteen hours. Although the side effects are similar in both products, Vyvanse may be safer and less harmful for the body.

## Vyvanse & Adderall Drug Interactions

Taking drugs such as Vyvanse can increase your blood pressure and cause dangerous side effects. You should consult a physician before taking MAOIs. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors include phenelzine, Procarbazine, and isocarboxazid. These medications increase levels of norepinephrine in the brain, which enhances mood and concentration. Although these drugs are rare in treating ADHD, they can help you if other medications have failed.

While it is safe to take Adderall alone, it can also interact with MAO inhibitors and other drugs that act on the same neurotransmitters. Taking Adderall with an MAO inhibitor can cause severe side effects, such as numbness, seizures, or increased heart rate. Additionally, it is important to consult with your doctor before taking any MAO inhibitors, such as phenelzine and Vyvanse, as they can increase the absorption of Adderall.

Using Vyvanse and Adderall simultaneously is a risky proposition. They both have serious potential for abuse. Both can increase the risk of heart problems, including heart attack, stroke, and even death. Therefore, it’s important to have a regular heart checkup before taking either one. In addition, people who take both should disclose any other medical conditions that may complicate their use of either drug.

While Vyvanse is often marketed as a “smoother” than Adderall, it’s possible to overdose with these drugs. The extended-release version of Adderall lasts 10-12 hours, while Vyvanse can last 14 hours. Both drugs can result in priapism, an over-the-counter drug that causes a penile erection lasting more than four hours.

## Other drugs to avoid mixing with Vyvanse

There are some other drugs to avoid while taking Vyvansy and Adderall together, and there are also a few food and drink items to stay away from while taking both medications.
