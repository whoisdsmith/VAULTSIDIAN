A painting of a cute goldendoodle wearing a suit, natural light, in the sky, with bright colors, by Studio Ghibli ❗ However, there is a problem. The goldendoodle is NOT in the sky… The AI didn’t take in “in the sky” properly. Worry not! You can change the order of the words a little bit if one part is important. The earlier a word is in the sentence, the more importance it will be given.

A painting of a cute goldendoodle in the sky, wearing a suit, natural light, with bright colors, by Studio Ghibli We moved “in the sky” earlier in the prompt

As you can see, the dog is now “in the sky”.

## The Order of Words is Important

The order and presentation of our desired output is almost as an important aspect as the vocabulary itself.

It is recommended to list your concepts explicitly and separately than trying to cramp it into one simple sentence.

A cat sitting on a martin table.  
A cat that is sitting on a table on mars.  
A cat that is sitting on a table. The table is on mars.
