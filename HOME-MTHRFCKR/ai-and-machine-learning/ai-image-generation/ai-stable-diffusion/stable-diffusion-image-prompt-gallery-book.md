## What is Stable Diffusion?


Stable Diffusion is computer software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to generate new kinds of images. 

The software enables you to type a phrase, such as "lucy in the sky with diamonds" or "mermaid underwater palace", then the software will generate new kinds of images that include a variety of astronauts, rockets, alients, planets, and the like.


### How does Stable Diffusion work?

Stable Diffusion works by analyzing millions of existing images, including each image's metadata, such as the image's tags on various social media websites.

Then the software combines the analyzed data, a user's text prompt, and random numbers. The result is new artwork that is blend of AI/ML and user-generated content.


### Where does Stable Diffusion come from?

Stable Diffusion is a creation of stability.ai.

https://stability.ai

The software is free open source. You're able to download it, install it, and run it.


## What is this book?

This book is a collection of many of our favorite Stable Diffusion generated images and their corresponding prompts.

All the book images are generated thanks to Stable Diffusion, a MacBook Pro, and reasonably simple prompts.

All the page descriptions are thanks to Wikipedia.

* Lucy in the sky with diamonds

* Robots celebrating a birthday party

* Comic book superhero battling evil

* Mermaid and underwater palace

* Redhead goddess with poodle in the style of Klimt

* Flying dragon breathing fire


## Lucy in the sky with diamonds

![](build/groups/lucy-in-the-sky-with-diamonds-the-beatles/montage-tile-2x3.png)

Prompt: lucy in the sky with diamonds

"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Lennon's son Julian inspired the song with a nursery school drawing that he called "Lucy – in the sky with diamonds". Lennon  attributed the song's fantastical imagery to his reading of Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland books.


## Robots celebrating a birthday party

![](build/groups/robots-celebrating-a-birthday-party/montage-tile-2x3.png)

Prompt: robots celebrating a birthday party

An android is a humanoid robot. Historically, androids were in the domain of science fiction, but recent advances in robot technology now allow the design of functional and realistic humanoid robots. A fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: simulacra (devices that exhibit likeness) and automata (devices that have independence).


## Comic book superhero battling evil

![](build/groups/comic-book-superhero-battling-evil/montage-tile-2x3.png)

Prompt: comic book superhero battling evil

Comic books have some origins in 18th century in Eastern Asia, and were popularized in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, Famous Funnies, was released in the US in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The most valuable American comics have combined rarity and quality with the first appearances of popular and enduring characters, such as Action Comics #1 with the first appearance of Superman, and Detective Comics #27 with the first appearance of Batman.


## Mermaid and underwater palace


Prompt: mermaid and underwater palace

A mermaid in folklore is an aquatic creature with the head and upper body of a female human and the tail of a fish. Mermaids are sometimes associated with perilous events such as floods, storms, shipwrecks, and drownings. In other folk traditions (or sometimes within the same traditions), they can be benevolent or beneficent, bestowing boons or falling in love with humans. Historical accounts of mermaids, such as those reported by Christopher Columbus during his exploration of the Caribbean, may have been sightings of manatees or similar aquatic mammals. Mermaids have been a popular subject of art and literature in recent centuries, such as in Hans Christian Andersen's literary fairy tale "The Little Mermaid" (1836).


## Redhead goddess with poodle in the style of Klimt

![](build/groups/redhead-goddess-with-poodle-in-the-style-of-klimt/montage-tile-2x3.png)

Prompt: redhead goddess with poodle in the style of Klimt

Redheads are approximately 1% of the human population, appearing with greater frequency among people of Northwestern European ancestry. Characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin, it is associated with fair skin color, lighter eye color, freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Red hair is most common in individuals homozygous for a recessive allele on chromosome 16 that produces an altered version of the MC1R protein. Red hair is also known as orange hair and ginger hair, and the term "redhead" has been in use since at least 1510.


## Flying dragon breathing fire

![](build/groups/flying-dragon-breathing-fire/montage-tile-2x3.png)

Prompt: flying dragon breathing fire

A dragon is a legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide. Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire. Dragons in eastern cultures are usually depicted as wingless, four-legged, serpentine creatures with above-average intelligence. Commonalities between dragons' traits are often a hybridization of feline, avian, and reptilian features. Scholars believe huge extinct or migrating crocodiles bear the closest resemblance, especially when encountered in forested or swampy areas, and are most likely the template of modern Oriental dragon imagery.


# Song mixing

A unicorn is a legendary creature that has been described since antiquity as a beast with a single large, pointed, spiraling horn projecting from its forehead. In the Middle Ages and Renaissance, it was commonly described as an extremely wild woodland creature, a symbol of purity and grace. Its horn was described as having the power to render poisoned water potable and to heal sickness. An equine unicorn was mentioned by the ancient Greeks in accounts of natural history by various writers. The Bible  describes an animal, the re'em, which some translations render as unicorn.


## Lord of the Rings forest

![](build/groups/lord-of-the-rings-rivendell-fantasy-forest/montage-tile-2x3.png)

Prompt: Lord of the Rings Rivendell fantasy forest

Rivendell (Sindarin: Imladris) is a valley in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, representing both a homely place of sanctuary and a magical Elvish otherworld. It is an important location in The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, being the place where the quest to destroy the One Ring began. Rivendell's feeling of peace may have contributed to the popularity of The Lord of the Rings during the war-troubled 1960s. Scholars have noted that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, from the hymn to Elbereth, recalling Tolkien's Catholicism, to the complex Song of Eärendil with its multiple poetic devices. Others have written that it resembles the Celtic Otherworld of Tír na nÓg; and that it physically recalls the valley of Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland where Tolkien had gone hiking in 1911.

## Buddhist

![](build/groups/buddhist-mythology-illustration/montage-tile-2x3.png)

The chief motif of this story, and the most distinctive feature of Buddhist myth, is the Buddha's renunciation, leaving his home and family for a spiritual quest. The traditions contain large numbers of smaller stories, which are usually supposed to convey an ethical or Buddhist teaching. Since these are regarded as episodes in the life of the Buddha, they are treated here as “myth”, rather than distinguishing between myth, legend, and folk-tale.

# Delicious food


This section shows food images.

These images help demonstrate that Stable Diffusion generates high-quality photo-realistic images. 

The success of these images is likely because of many food bloggers sharing their food photos on social networks, plus many restaurant websites, menu websites, and recipie websites.

A notable error is in the breakfast images: Stable Diffusion doesn't seem to understand how to use the word "vegan".


### Image prompts

This section uses these image prompts:

* Delicious breakfast with vegan food

* Delicious lunch with healthy food

* Delicious picnic with outdoorsy food

* Delicious dessert with tempting food

* Delicious wine with candlelight food

## About the software

The Stable diffusion software information is thanks to [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/Stable_Diffusion).


### Introduction

Stable Diffusion is a deep learning, text-to-image model released by startup StabilityAI in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.

Stable Diffusion's code and model weights have been released publicly. Analysis of the model's training data suggests that approximately 47% of images came from 100 different domains, such as Pinterest, WordPress, Blogspot, Flickr, DeviantArt, and Wikimedia Commons.


### Text to image generation

The text to image sampling script within Stable Diffusion, known as "txt2img", consumes a text prompt, in addition to assorted option parameters covering sampling types, output image dimensions, and seed values, and outputs an image file based on the model's interpretation of the prompt.


### Runtime requirements

The software can run on most consumer hardware equipped with a modest GPU. This was a departure from proprietary text-to-image models such as DALL-E and Midjourney which were accessible only via cloud services.


### Architecture

Stable Diffusion is a form of diffusion model (DM). Introduced in 2015, diffusion models are trained with the objective of removing successive applications of Gaussian noise to training images, and can be thought of as a sequence of denoising autoencoders. Stable Diffusion uses a variant known as a "latent diffusion model" (LDM) developed by researchers at LMU Munich. Rather than learning to denoise image data (in "pixel space"), an autoencoder is trained to transform images into a lower-dimensional latent space. 


### Denoising conditioning

The denoising step may be conditioned on a string of text, an image, or some other data. An encoding of the conditioning data is exposed to the denoising U-Nets via a cross-attention mechanism. For conditioning on text, a transformer language model was trained to encode text prompts.


### Sizing

The Stable Diffusion model is trained on a dataset consisting of 512×512 resolution images, meaning that txt2img output images are optimally configured to be generated at 512×512 resolution as well, and deviating from this size can result in poor quality generation outputs.


### License

Stable Diffusion makes its source code available, along with pre-trained weights. Its license prohibits certain use cases, including crime, libel, harassment, doxxing, exploiting minors, medical advice, legal obligations, and more.


### Training

Stable Diffusion was trained on pairs of images and captions taken from LAION-5B, a publically available dataset derived from Common Crawl data scraped from the web. The model was trained using 256 Nvidia A100 GPUs on Amazon Web Services for a total of 150,000 GPU-hours, at a cost of $600,000.

The model was initially trained on a large subset of LAION-5B. The model was then trained on a subset of 600 million captioned images which an AI predicted that humans would give a score of at least 5 out of 10 when asked to rate how much they liked them, and which were higher-resolution, and evaluated as non-watermarked.
