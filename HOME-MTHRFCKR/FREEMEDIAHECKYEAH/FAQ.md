# FAQs
**Q**: Why are there no posts? *Is the sub dead?* :(

**A**: Posting has always been off to keep the chances of the sub surviving as high as possible. Our main focus is the **[Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/index)**, which has grown to include nearly 30k links. **It's 100% alive**, and gets updated [daily](https://github.com/nbats/FMHYedit/commits/main). For a discussion sub, check out /r/Piracy.
***
**Q**: Are the sites here safe to use? 

**A**: Yes, we always scan files and research sites before adding them. We also listen to the community, so if there's something you feel needs to be addressed you're more than welcome to contact us.
***
**Q**: How can I contact you? 

**A**: The best way is to join us in [Divolt](https://redd.it/uto5vw). Here you can submit links, get help or suggest changes to the wiki. My reddit [DMs](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=nbatman) and [mod messages](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH) are also open.
***
**Q**: Can I edit FMHY?

**A**: **Yes!** This project is ran by and belongs to the community, so we allow anyone to suggest changes by sending [pull requests](https://rentry.co/FMHYedit). Changes will have to be approved by us first, but please don't be shy. We appreciate any improvements, even if they're just small things like better descriptions, fixing errors, reorganizing etc.
***
**Q**: How do I view encoded links?

**A**: You can use a [base64 decoder](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/storage#wiki_encode_.2F_decode_urls) or [script](https://pastebin.com/raw/HVAWhmG5) / [2](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/DanielBlaze/Reddit_Base64_Decoder). If it won't let you copy on mobile try [troddit](https://www.troddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/base64).
***
**Q**: Why is there no NSFW section?

**A**: There is, its just separate from FMHY. You can find it by joining Divolt, or checking my saidit profile via [backups](https://www.reddit.com/r/FREEMEDIAHECKYEAH/wiki/backups).
***
**Q**: Divolt isn't loading, what should I do?

**A**: If the page won't load, try clearing your cache, a different browser, disabling ublock or using incognito. During signup you can use a fake email, but it will only load with real domains like .gmail.
***
**Q**: Can I donate?

**A**: We appreciate that people want to support us, but we never have and never will accept donations. We maintain this project because its fun and we want to help others, not make money.
