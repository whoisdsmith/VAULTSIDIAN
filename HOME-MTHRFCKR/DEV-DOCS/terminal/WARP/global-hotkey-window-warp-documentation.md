Enable Quake Mode through the Settings Dialog.

After you've registered a keybinding you can show and hide Warp regardless of whether the app is focused.

You could customize the windowâ€™s pinned position and its width and height ratio relative to your active screen size. _Note:_ Your new customization will apply the **next** time the a hotkey window is created and not the currently opened one.

If the window does not open after pressing the registered hotkey, check under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Accessibility and tick the checkbox for Warp to grant access.
