# Server Status FAQs | Bluehost Support

---
## Overview

Bluehost's system administrators constantly monitor our servers and act quickly to prevent any possible problems or correct any that have may have occurred. This article will explain some of the most common reasons we might need to work on a server.  
 

**Q:** **My website is down. Can you move my account to another server?**

**A:** We apologize for the downtime you experienced and any inconvenience this may have caused. Our priority is to get the server up and running as soon as possible, so you experience no more downtime. The resources and time it would take to move you to another box are far greater than the current resources to bring your server back online. Unfortunately, at this time, because your account is on a server that is undergoing maintenance, we cannot move your account. Even if it were possible to migrate your account to another server, it would take 24 to 48 hours for DNS propagation in addition to the time of moving your files. Doing this would also pull valuable resources and increase the length of time to resolve any issues currently being addressed.

 

**Q:** **What is the Affiliate program?**

**A:** We offer you the opportunity to earn a commission while promoting our hosting products to your audience and clients!

 

**Q:** **Why do you perform these updates in the middle of the day?**

**A:** We notify our customers in advance, by email, of any maintenance which we expect to cause downtime. We also schedule these updates during a time when it will impact the least amount of customers. There are times, however, when emergency repair and security fixes need to be done immediately. Due to the nature of this situation, it is not in anyone's best interest to delay action.

 

**Q:** **What is a rebuild tree?**

**A:** A shared web host server contains millions of files. Given the amount of traffic to a shared server, corruption occasionally occurs. A file systems check or rebuild tree the way a server corrects this corruption. Because of the number of files on the server, this process can take anywhere from 1 to 4 hours, and in some cases, on other file systems can take 4 to 8 hours.

 

**Q:** **Why don't you have server redundancy?**

**A:** We have invested millions of dollars in providing as many redundant systems as possible, such as routers, Internet connectivity, ups power backups, and backup generators. However, the shared hosting environment does not allow us to offer redundant or clustered servers while keeping our customers' costs low.

 

**Q:** **Can I get a prorated refund for the downtime?**

**A:** Due to the complexity and nature of a shared web hosting environment, downtime occurs. Unfortunately, we do not offer compensation for any downtime. We are sorry for any inconvenience or loss which resulted from your website being down.
