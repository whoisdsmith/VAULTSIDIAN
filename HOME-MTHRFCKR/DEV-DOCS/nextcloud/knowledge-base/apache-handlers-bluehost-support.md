# Apache Handlers | Bluehost Support

---
Apache handlers allow you to control what Apache will do with certain file types. When Apache sees a file, it has an action built in for that file type and will perform that action. If you wish Apache to do a different action, you will need to make a handler to tell Apache to perform that action. For example, if you use a file type that requires a special service to run it, such as a file with server-side includes that is not named with a .shtml extension, you need to tell Apache to treat these files differently. More information on Apache's Handlers can be found atÂ [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/handler.html](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/handler.html).

## Creating An Apache Handler

1.  Log into your Bluehost cPanel.
2.  Go to the "**Advanced**" group of icons.
3.  Click on "**Apache Handlers**".
4.  Enter the handler you want to create in the first empty text box.
5.  In the second empty text box, enter the extension the handler will use when being called.
6.  Click on the **Add** button.
7.  Click on the Go Back button to return to the Main cPanel menu.
