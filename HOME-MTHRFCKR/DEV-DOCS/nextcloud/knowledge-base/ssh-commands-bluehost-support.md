Each line represents one process, with a process being loosely defined as a running instance of a program. The column-headed PID (process ID) shows the assigned process numbers of the processes. The heading COMMAND shows the location of the executed process.  
 

### Putting commands together

Often you will find that you need to use different commands on the same line.  
Here are some examples.

-   The **|** character is called a pipe, and it takes a date from one program and pipes it to another.
-   **\>** means create a new file, overwriting any content already there.
-   **\>>** means to append data to a file, creating a new one if it does not already exist.
-   **<** send input from a file back into a command.
    -   **grep User /usr/local/apache/conf/httpd.conf | more** - This will dump all lines that match User from the httpd.conf, then print the results to your screen one page at a time.
    -   **last -a > /root/lastlogins.tmp** - This will print all the current login history to a file called lastlogins.tmp in /root/
    -   **netstat -an | grep:80 | wc -l -** Show how many active connections there are to apache (httpd runs on port 80)
    -   **mysqladmin processlist | wc -l**  - Show how many current open connections there are to MySQL
    -   **mysqldump -u username -p dbname > file.sql** - MySQL Dump
    -   **mysql -u username -p database\_name <file.sql** - Importing MySQL database
    -   **tail -10000 /var/log/exim\_mainlog | grep domain.com | more** - This will grab the last 10,000 lines from /var/log/exim\_mainlog, find all occurrences of domain.com (the period represents 'anything,' comment it out with a so it will be interpreted literally), then send it to your screen page by page.
    -   **tar -zxvf file.tar.gz**  - UnTAR file
    -   **which \[perl\]**  -  Finding path to \[perl\]
