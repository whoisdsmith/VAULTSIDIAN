# Raw Access Logs | Bluehost Support

## Overview

AW Access Logs allow you to see who has accessed your site without the use of graphs, charts, or other graphics. You can use the Access Logs icon in the cPanel to download a zipped version of the server's Raw Access Log for your site. This can be very useful when you need to see who is accessing your site quickly.

Before proceeding to the instruction below, please take note that Legacy accounts will feature a horizontal navigation bar at the top of the screen, while Bluerock account users will see a vertical navigation menu on the left-hand side of the screen. To learn more, please see [Rock vs. Legacy](https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/rock-vs-legacy) to determine which steps to follow.

4.  Click **OK** to save the file to a directory on your computer.
