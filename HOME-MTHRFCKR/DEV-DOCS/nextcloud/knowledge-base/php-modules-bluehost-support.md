# PHP Modules | Bluehost Support

---
We get a lot of PHP questions regarding our shared hosting packages and what modules they support.

**Important Note:** Any modules **NOT** listed below are either **incompatible** or **not allowed** on shared or reseller hosting. In case you are missing any of the listed modules, please contact us via [phone](http://www.bluehost.com/contact) or [Live Chat](https://helpchat.bluehost.com/) with the names of the modules.

These modules are currently installed on all servers (Linux and Windows), except as indicated below.

## PHP Modules

Modules included will depend on the version of PHP you are using. Please click the PHP version you currently have set below to review a list of modules installed:

-   [ea-php54](http://hgfix.net/paste/view/raw/3700597c)
-   [ea-php56](http://hgfix.net/paste/view/raw/de27c8df)
-   [ea-php70](http://hgfix.net/paste/view/raw/2e6d0670)
-   [ea-php71](http://hgfix.net/paste/view/raw/c58c8db9)

-   [ea-php73](http://hgfix.net/paste/view/raw/428ae9a9)

**Note:** VPS and Dedicated servers have fewer restrictions in regards to requesting and/or applying modules. If you are interested in upgrading your Shared Hosting account, check out our [VPS](https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/vps) or [Dedicated Hosting](https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/dedicated) packages.

-   **Not all** PHP versions are available on all shared platforms.
-   Support **does not** install PHP Versions or Modules upon customer request on shared platforms. 
-   Support **does** install PHP Versions or Modules upon customer request on VPS/Dedicated platforms if it's supported by cPanel (i.e. inside of the EasyApache4 interface).

For further assistance, you may contact our [Chat Support](https://helpchat.bluehost.com/) or Phone Support via **888-401-4678**.
