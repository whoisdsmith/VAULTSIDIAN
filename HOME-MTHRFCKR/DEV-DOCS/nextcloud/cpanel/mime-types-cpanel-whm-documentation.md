## Overview

MIME types relay information to the browser about how to handle file extensions. MIME types can allow visitors’ browsers to handle new technologies as they become available.

To add new MIME types to your web server, define the name, directory, and file extension that correspond to the MIME type.

## Create a MIME Type

To add a MIME type, perform the following steps:

1.  Enter the name of the file type’s handler in the _MIME Type_ text box.
    -   For example, `application/cgi` represents the handler for the `.cgi` file extension.
2.  Enter the file extension in the _Extension(s)_ text box.
    -   A file extension represents the letters after the dot (`.`) in a file name. For example, `filename.fileextension`.
3.  Click _Add_.

## Delete a user-defined MIME type

To delete a MIME type, click the corresponding _Delete_ link under the _Remove_ heading, and then click _Delete MIME Type_ to confirm that you wish to remove the MIME type.

Note:

You **cannot** delete MIME types from the _System MIME Types_ table.

## More about MIME types

For more information, read the [Webmaster Toolkit list of MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types). You can also use your preferred search engine to research the MIME type that you wish to add.
