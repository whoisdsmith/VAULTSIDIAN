## API for other apps to interact with activities

In Nextcloud 11 the old extension API was replaced by 3 new interfaces, to better split the functionality up. Documentation for each of those can be found in the `docs/` folder:

  * [Create](/nextcloud/activity/blob/master/docs/create.md) \- an activity and store it in the app
  * [Provider](/nextcloud/activity/blob/master/docs/provider.md) \- translate and render activities
  * [Setting](/nextcloud/activity/blob/master/docs/setting.md) \- allow users to control what they want to see in their stream or mail
  * [Filter](/nextcloud/activity/blob/master/docs/filter.md) \- allow to reduce the stream in the web UI by app or setting
