# PHP Configuration for Addon Domain | Bluehost Support

---
## Overview

To use specific PHP settings only for a particular addon domain you will need to place a php.ini file in the addon domain's folder.

## Configure PHP for an Addon Domain

If you need to generate a new php.ini file, this can be done in the cPanel by clicking on the icon "PHP Config", choose your version of PHP and then click **Save**. This will copy the server's master php.ini to your public\_html directory as "php.ini.default". This file must then be moved to the addon's folder and renamed to php.ini.

If you are using the 'single php.ini' option in the cPanel's **PHP Config** section, you will need to create a .htaccess file in the addon's folder. In the addon's .htaccess file it needs to contain a regular PHP handler:

```
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php7 .php
```

To verify your addon domain is using the php.ini file you have set up, you can create a new file in the addon's folder called info.php containing the following PHP code:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

Viewing the info.php file in a web browser should show you all the PHP settings from the addon's php.ini including the "Loaded Configuration File". This is the path to the php.ini file being used.
