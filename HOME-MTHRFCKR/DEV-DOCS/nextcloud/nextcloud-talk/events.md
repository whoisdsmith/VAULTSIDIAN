# PHP Events

Explanations:
* `Event class`: is the PHP class of the event object that is passed by the event
* `Event name`: refers to the PHP constant that contains the full name for the event. You should always use the constants instead of copying the value to avoid problems in the future. Most events have a `Before` and `After` event name. They behave the same and reflect if the event is triggered before or after the action described.
