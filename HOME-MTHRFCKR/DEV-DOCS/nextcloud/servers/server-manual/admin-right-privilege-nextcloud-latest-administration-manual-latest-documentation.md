# Admin right privilege — Nextcloud latest Administration Manual latest documentation

By default only members of the admin group can access and edit the admin settings. It is sometimes needed to give some group of users access to a setting page while not giving them access to everything. For this you can use the _Admin right privilege_ settings.

Note

Not every setting pages support this features. This is due to either the feature not being implemented yet for the specific setting page or due to possible privilege escalations.

## Configuring Admin right privilege

Go to the _Admin right privilege_ Admin page, you should be presented with the list of settings that support this features.
