<br>

**A tool that synchronizes your YouTube playlists and other music providers with your Cloud Storage like Nextcloud as MP3s.**

### What can it do? ‚ú®
- üéµ Downloads your music from YouTube, SoundCloud [and many more](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html)
- üòÅ Automatically monitors your playlists for newly added music
- üîÑ Converts video files to the highest quality MP3 possible
- &nbsp;‚òÅ &nbsp;Uploads your music as MP3 to your Cloud Storage account. Supports all Cloud providers with WebDAV compatibility: Nextcloud, ownCloud, pCloud, STACK [and many more](https://community.cryptomator.org/t/webdav-urls-of-common-cloud-storage-services/75)
- üñº Adds coverart to your MP3s automatically
- üóÉ It's aware of the songs that have already been downloaded. This saves a lot of time since they don't get redownloaded every time the application runs again.

## How to install
The Music Service is a microservice application and runs as a [Docker container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/). Because of using Docker, every installation runs the same, for everyone. This brings efficiency and improves reliability. [Docker image release](https://hub.docker.com/r/thijstakken/musicservice)

> :warning: **You must have Docker installed**: Either the Docker [Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (with GUI) or [Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (no GUI) installed on your system.

> :information_source: **Tip**: If you are new, you might want to test this application first. Luckily there is a good tool to use. [Nextcloud has a website](https://try.nextcloud.com/) where it will create a Nextcloud test environment. Select the "Instant trial" and you get a fresh environment for 60 minutes to play around.

> :information_source: **Recommendation**: For the best experience, install this on a computer/server which runs 24/7, so you will always have your music in sync.

<br>

1. Copy this code to your favorite editor, Notepad, Word etc. Some changes have to be made before you can run it:
```
docker run -d \
 --name musicservice \
 --restart=always \
 -v config:/config \
 -v musiccache:/music \
 -e URL=https://demo2.nextcloud.com/remote.php/dav/files/kA2kSpbk2tMwCPpB/ \
 -e DIRECTORY=/some/01%20my%20music \
 -e USERNAME=kA2kSpbk2tMwCPpB \
 -e PASSWORD=demo \
 -e INTERVAL=5 \
thijstakken/musicservice:latest
```

<br>

2. Configure `URL` (required):

    1. Go to your Nextcloud website
    2. Go to the "files" menu at the top
    3. Now in the lower left corner, select "Settings"
    4. Copy the whole WebDAV URL you see there
    5. And place it after the `URL=`

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


3. Configure `DIRECTORY` (required): <br/>

    - Option 1: You can leave it empty like this `-e DIRECTORY= \`, then it will save the files to the root directory off your cloud storage. (not recommended) 
    
    <br>

    - Option 2: Or you can specify a custom directory, like your music folder:<br>
    1. Navigate to your music folder in Nextcloud 
    2. In the URL you have to copy the path, everything between `dir=` and the `&fileid=2274`
    3. And then copy it to the DIRECTORY variable, example: `/some/01%20my%20music`

4. Configure `USERNAME` (required): <br>
    1. Go to your Nextcloud webpage and and click on your user-icon in the top right
    2. Click "View profile"
    3. Copy and paste your username in the USERNAME variable
    
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

5. Configure `PASSWORD` (required): <br/>

    - Option 1: (account without 2FA multifactor)
    1. Copy your password into the PASSWORD variable
    
    <br>
    
    <img src="../Apps/MusicService/images/ncusername.png" alt="syncShowcase" align="right" width="160px"/>
    

    - Option 2: (account has 2FA multifactor protection)
    1. Go to the right top corner of your Nextcloud website and click the user-icon 
    2. Click on `Settings`

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    <img src="../Apps/MusicService/images/securityNavigation.png" alt="syncShowcase" align="right" width="160px"/>

    3. In the left bar, go to "Security" 

    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    4. Scroll down to the bottom where you will find `Devices & sessions`

    <img src="../Apps/MusicService/images/generateAppPassword.png" alt="syncShowcase" width="500px"/>

    5. Fill in an app name like `musicservice`
    6. Click `Create new app password`
    7. Copy the code that appears (53Xqg-...) into the PASSWORD variable


    ![Copy this app password](../Apps/MusicService/images/CredentialGenerated.png)

<br>

6. Configure `INTERVAL` (optional): <br>
By default it's set to 5 if you don't specify anything. This is true even if you leave the whole INTERVAL variable out of the command. <br>
If you want to run the script more often or less often, you can just put in a number. 

- It's in minutes, so a `10` will represent 10 minutes. The program will then run with intervals of 10 minutes. 
- If you only want to run the script one time. You can set the number to `0` and then the script will not run on shedule and just stop after one run.

<br>

7. Open a terminal and run your command!

8. That's all! If everything is correct, it will create the container, mount the volumes with the configuration and then do it's first run. Let it run for a minute or so. If everything works you should see a new folder and song in your cloud storage. If that happened everything is working fine. <br>
But if this is not the case, the program crashed or it's taking longer then 5 minutes, then you should check out the logs. <br>

9. Check the logs (optional): <br>
To check a crashed container or just have a peek at the logs, you can run this command on your terminal `docker logs musicservice` and it will display the logs for you. This is how you can do debugging, find out if everything is working like it should or if there are any errors.

<br>

## Managing your playlist list

> :information_source: **Tip**: You can update the playlists file while the container is running. If you made any changes, they will be in effect the next time it checks for newly added music. Default `INTERVAL` is 5 minutes.

1. You can update which playlists to download here: `/config/playlists` 
2. On your machine open up a terminal.
3. With `docker volume inspect config` you can see the directory location of the volume.
4. Go to that directory, go into the `_data` directory and there you will find the `playlists` file, 
5. Edit the `playlists` file with your favorite editor like Nano :), and add every playlist/song that you want to add **as a new line**. Like this:
```
youtube.com/playlist1
youtube.com/playlist2
youtube.com/video3
```
6. Save the file, and the next time the container runs or checks for newly added songs, it will look at the playlists file for any updates.

## How to best migrate from existing youtube-dl solution
If you where already using youtube-dl with the archive function, you probably have an downloaded.txt or similar file with all the songs you have already downloaded. 

1. :warning: Shut down the musicservice container first

2. To migrate, just copy the contents of the old file over to the `/config/downloaded` file. You can find that file at the musicdatabase volume

3. Run `docker volume inspect config` at your command line to find the location of that volume on your disk

4. Open the file, paste the old information in and save it.

5. That's it!

System requirements: Have [Docker (Desktop or Engine)](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system <br/>
Techniques: [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and [WebDAV](http://www.webdav.org/)

1. ü§† Git clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/thijstakken/MusicService.git`
2. üêõ [Pick a issue from the list or create a new issue and use that one](https://github.com/thijstakken/MusicService/issues)
3. üêç Start editing the code (Python)
4. üèó To build your new image, open a command line in the project folder and run `docker build -t musicservice:dev .`
5. üß™ For testing, there is a good tool to use. [Nextcloud has a website](https://try.nextcloud.com/) where it will create a Nextcloud test environment. Select the "Instant trial" and you get a fresh environment for 60 minutes to play around. This way we can safely experiment with new code and functions. Copy the username into USERNAME and the password is always: demo <br/>

You can use this base developer Docker command, and change it to your needs to get started:
```
docker run \
 --name musicservice \
 --restart=no \
 -v config:/config \
 -v musiccache:/music \
 -e URL=https://demo1.nextcloud.com/remote.php/dav/files/wpS97kPjnDJo6gGQ/ \
 -e DIRECTORY= \
 -e USERNAME=wpS97kPjnDJo6gGQ \
 -e PASSWORD=demo \
 -e INTERVAL=0 \
musicservice:dev
```

6. üéâ Create a branch and make your changes. When committing changes please use [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/) and [close the corresponding issue with "fixed"](https://github.com/gitbucket/gitbucket/wiki/How-to-Close-Reference-issues-and-pull-request) and the number of the issue `git commit -m ":bug: fixed #21 Your commit message"`
7. ‚¨Ü Create a [pull request](https://github.com/thijstakken/MusicService/pulls)
8. üöÄ Wait for it to be reviewed and merged!

9. Cleaning up, or starting over with testing: <br>
- Delete the container with: `docker rm musicservice`
- Delete the config volume with: `docker volume rm config`
- Delete the musiccache volume with: `docker volume rm musiccache`

Use at your own risk, never trust the code of a random dude on the internet without first checking it yourself :)
