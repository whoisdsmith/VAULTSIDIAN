# GitHub - owncloud/music: Music app for ownCloud

# README

Music player and server for ownCloud and Nextcloud. Shows audio files stored in your cloud categorized by artists and albums. Supports mp3, and depending on the browser, many other audio formats too. Supports shuffle play and playlists. The Music app also allows serving audio files from your cloud to external applications which are compatible either with Ampache or Subsonic.

## Supported formats

  * FLAC (`audio/flac`)
  * MP3 (`audio/mpeg`)
  * Vorbis in OGG container (`audio/ogg`)
  * Opus in OGG container (`audio/ogg` or `audio/opus`)
  * WAV (`audio/wav`)
  * M4A (`audio/mp4`)
  * M4B (`audio/m4b`)

_Note: The audio formats supported vary depending on the browser. Most recents versions of Chrome, Firefox and Edge should be able to play all the formats listed above. All browsers should be able to play at least the MP3 files._

### Detail

The modern web browsers ship with a wide variety of built-in audio codecs which can be used directly via the standard HTML5 audio API. This is the default playback methdod used by the Music app. In case the browser at hand doesn't have a codec for the file format in question, the app attempts to play the file using the Aurora.js library, instead. This library uses javascript to decode the supported file formats which are MP3 and FLAC.

## Usage hints

Normally, the Music app detects any new audio files in the filesystem on application start and scans metadata from those to its database tables when the user clicks the prompt. The Music app also detects file removals and modifications on the background and makes the required database changes automatically.

If the database would somehow get corrupted, the user can force it to be rebuilt from scratch by opening the Settings (at the bottom of the left pane) and clicking the option "Reset music collection".

### Commands

If preferred, it is also possible to use the command line tool for the database maintenance as described below. This may be quicker than scanning via the web UI in case of large music library, and optionally allows targeting more than one user at once.

Following commands are available(see script occ in your ownCloud root folder):

#### Scan music files

Scan all audio files not already indexed in the database. Extract metadata from those and insert it to the database. Target either specified user(s) or user group(s) or all users.
    
    
    ./occ music:scan USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ...
    ./occ music:scan --group=USERGROUP1 --group==USERGROUP2 ...
    ./occ music:scan --all
    
    
    
    
    
    All the above commands can be combined with the --debug switch, which enables debug output and shows the memory usage of each scan step.
    
    
    
    
    You can also supply the option --rescan to scan also the files which are already part of the collection. This might be necessary, if some file update has been missed by the app because of some bug or because the admin has temporarily disabled the app.
    
    
    
    
    Lastly, you can give option --clean-obsolete to make the process check all the previously scanned files, and clean up those which are no longer found. Again, this is usually handled automatically, but manually running the command could be necessary on some special cases.
    
    
    
    
    #### Reset scanned metadata
    
    
    
    
    Reset all data stored to the music database. Target either specified user(s) or user group(s) or all users.
    
    
    
    
    **Warning:** This command will erase user-created data! It will remove all playlists as playlists are linked against the track metadata.
    
    
    
    
    
    ./occ music:reset-database USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ...
    ./occ music:reset-database --group=USERGROUP1 --group==USERGROUP2 ...
    ./occ music:reset-database --all
    
    
    
    
    
    #### Reset cache
    
    
    
    
    Music app caches some results for performance reasons. Normally, there should be no reason to reset this cache manually, but it might be desiredable e.g. when running performance tests. Target either specified user(s) or user group(s) or all users.
    
    
    
    
    
    ./occ music:reset-cache USERNAME1 USERNAME2 ...
    ./occ music:reset-cache --group=USERGROUP1 --group==USERGROUP2 ...
    ./occ music:reset-cache --all
    
    
    
    
    
    ### Ampache and Subsonic
    
    
    
    
    The URL you need to connect with an Ampache-compatible player is listed in the settings and looks like this:
    
    
    
    
    
    https://cloud.domain.org/index.php/apps/music/ampache
    
    
    
    
    
    This is the common path. Most clients append the last part (/server/xml.server.php) automatically. If you have connection problems, try the longer version of the URL with the /server/xml.server.php appended.
    
    
    
    
    Similarly, the URL used to connect with a Subsonic-compatible player is listed in the settings and looks like this:
    
    
    
    
    
    https://cloud.domain.org/index.php/apps/music/subsonic
    
    
    
    
    
    #### Authentication
    
    
    
    
    Ampache and Subsonic don't use your ownCloud password for authentication. Instead, you need to use a specifically generated APIKEY with them.
    The APIKEY is generated through the Music app settings accessible from the link at the bottom of the left pane within the app. The generated APIKEY is shown upon creation but it is impossible to retrieve it at later time. If you forget or misplace the key, you can always delete it and generate a new one.
    
    
    
    
    When you create the APIKEY, the application shows also the username you should use on your Ampache/Subsonic client. Typically, this is your ownCloud login name but it may also be an UUID in case you have set up LDAP authentication.
    
    
    
    
    ### Installation
    
    
    
    
    The Music app can be installed using the App Management in ownCloud. Instructions can be found [here](https://doc.owncloud.org/server/8.1/admin_manual/installation/apps_management_installation.html).
    
    
    
    
    After installation, you may want to select a specific sub-folder containing your music files through the settings of the application. This can be useful to prevent unwanted audio files to be included in the music library.
    
    
    
    
    ### Known issues
    
    
    
    
    #### Huge music collections
    
    
    
    
    The application's scalability for large music collections has gradually improved as new versions have been released. Still, if the collection is large enough, the application may fail to load. The maximum number of tracks supported depends on your server but should be more than 50'000. Also, when there are tens of thousands of tracks, switching the application views may take pretty long time. For the best performance on huge music collections, Firefox 57.0+ (aka "Quantum") is recommended. On the most recent Music app version, also up-to-date Chrome or Edge browser should perform sufficiently well.
    
    
    
    
    #### Translations
    
    
    
    
    There exist partial translations for the Music app for many languages, but all of them are very much incomplete. The application is translated at <https://www.transifex.com/owncloud-org/owncloud/> but most of the strings used in the app are not currently visible on Transifex. This is because of disparity in the localization mechanisms used in the Music app and on ownCloud in general. This issue is followed at <https://central.owncloud.org/t/owncloud-music-app-translations/14881> .
    
    
    
    
    #### SMB shares
    
    
    
    
    The Music app may be unable to extract metadata of the files residing on a SMB share. This is because, on some system configurations, it is not possible to use fseek() function to seek within the remote files on the SMB share. The getID3 library used for metadata extraction depends on fseek() and will fail on such systems. If the metadata extraction fails, the Music app falls back to deducing the track names from the file names and the album names from the folder names. Whether or not the probelm exists on a system, may depend on the details of the SMB support library on the host computer and the remote computer providing the share.
    
    
    
    
    ## Development
    
    
    
    
    ### L10n hints
    
    
    
    
    Sometimes translatable strings aren't detected. Try to move the translate attribute
    more to the beginning of the HTML element.
    
    
    
    
    ### Build frontend bundle
    
    
    
    
    All the frontend javascript sources of the Music app, including the used vendor libraries, are bundled into a single file for deployment using webpack. This bundle file is dist/webpack.app.js. Similarly, all the style files of the Music app are bundled into dist/webpack.app.css. Downloading the vendor libraries and generating these bundles requires the npm utility, and happens by running:
    
    
    
    
    
    cd build
    npm install --deps
    npm run build
    
    
    
    
    
    The command above builds the minified production version of the bundle. To build the development version, use
    
    
    
    
    
    To automatically regenerate the development mode bundles whenever the source .js/.css files change, use
    
    
    
    
    
    ### Build delivery package
    
    
    
    
    To build the release zip package, run the following commands. This requires the make and zip command line utilities.
    
    
    
    
    
    ### Install test dependencies
    
    
    
    
    
    ### Run tests
    
    
    
    
    #### Static analysis with PHPStan
    
    
    
    
    
    composer run-script analyze
    
    
    
    
    
    #### PHP unit tests
    
    
    
    
    
    composer run-script unit-tests
    
    
    
    
    
    #### PHP integration tests
    
    
    
    
    The integration tests require the music app to be installed under the apps folder of an ownCloud or Nextcloud installation. The following steps assume that the cloud installation in question has not been taken into use yet, e.g. it's a fresh clone from github.
    
    
    
    
    
    cd ../..          # owncloud/nextcloud core
    ./occ maintenance:install --admin-user admin --admin-pass admin --database sqlite
    ./occ app:enable music
    cd apps/music
    composer run-script integration-tests
    
    
    
    
    
    #### Behat acceptance tests
    
    
    
    
    
    cd tests
    cp behat.yml.dist behat.yml
    # add cloud URL and credentials for Ampache and Subsonic APIs to behat.yml
    ../vendor/bin/behat
    
    
    
    
    
    For the acceptance tests, you need to upload all the tracks from the following zip file to your cloud instance: <https://github.com/paulijar/music/files/2364060/testcontent.zip>
    
    
    
    
    ## API
    
    
    
    
    The Music app back-end implements the [Shiva API](https://shiva.readthedocs.org/en/latest/resources/base.html) except the resources /artists/<int:artist_id>/shows, /tracks/<int:track_id>/lyrics and the meta resources. You can use this API under https://own.cloud.example.org/index.php/apps/music/api/.
    
    
    
    
    However, the front-end of the Music app nowadays doesn't use any part of the Shiva API. Instead, the following proprietary REST endpoints are used:
    
    
    
    
    
    
      * /api/log
    
    
      * /api/prepare_collection
    
    
      * /api/collection
    
    
      * /api/folders
    
    
      * /api/genres
    
    
      * /api/file/{fileId}
    
    
      * /api/file/{fileId}/download
    
    
      * /api/file/{fileId}/path
    
    
      * /api/file/{fileId}/info
    
    
      * /api/file/{fileId}/details
    
    
      * /api/scanstate
    
    
      * /api/scan
    
    
      * /api/resetscanned
    
    
      * /api/cover/{hash}
    
    
      * /api/artist/{artistId}/cover
    
    
      * /api/artist/{artistId}/details
    
    
      * /api/artist/{artistId}/similar
    
    
      * /api/album/{albumId}/cover
    
    
      * /api/album/{albumId}/details
    
    
      * /api/share/{token}/{fileId}/info
    
    
      * /api/share/{token}/{fileId}/parse
    
    
      * Playlist API at /api/playlists/*
    
    
      * Radio API at /api/radio/*
    
    
      * Podcast API at /api/podcasts/*
    
    
      * Settings API at /api/settings/*
    
    
    
    
    To connect external client applications, partial implementations of the following APIs are available:
    
    
    
    
    
    
      * [Ampache XML API](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/XML-methods) at /ampache/server/xml.server.php
    
    
      * [Ampache JSON API](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/JSON-methods) at /ampache/server/json.server.php
    
    
      * [Subsonic API](http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp) at /subsonic/rest/{method}
    
    
    
    
    ### /api/log
    
    
    
    
    Allows to log a message to ownCloud defined log system.
    
    
    
    
    
    Parameters:
    
    
    
    
    
    {
    	"message": "The message to log"
    }
    
    
    
    
    
    Response:
    
    
    
    
    
    ### /api/collection
    
    
    
    
    Returns all artists with nested albums and each album with nested tracks. Each track carries a file ID which can be used to obtain the file path with /api/file/{fileId}/path. The front-end converts the path into playable WebDAV link like this: OC.linkToRemoteBase('webdav') + path.
    
    
    
    
    
    Response:

    ### Creating APIKEY for Subsonic/Ampache
    
    
    
    
    The endpoint /api/settings/userkey/generate may be used to programatically generate a random password to be used with an Ampache or a Subsonic client. The endpoint expects two parameters, length (optional) and description (mandatory) and returns a JSON response.
    Please note that the minimum password length is 10 characters. The HTTP return codes represent also the status of the request.
    
    
    
    
    
    POST /api/settings/userkey/generate
    
    
    
    
    
    Parameters:
    
    
    
    
    
    {
    	"length": <length>,
    	"description": <description>
    }
    
    
    
    
    
    Response (success):
    
    
    
    
    
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    
    {
    	"id": <userkey_id>,
    	"password": <random_password>,
    	"description": <description>
    }
    
    
    
    
    
    Response (error - no description provided):
    
    
    
    
    
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad request
    
    {
    	"message": "Please provide a description"
    }
    
    
    
    
    
    Response (error - error while saving password):
    
    
    
    
    
    HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
    
    {
