# Nextcloud Circles


### Important Notes 

 - `master` contains a version of Circles for NC22 and is not compatible with older version of Nextcloud_
 - Because of the huge difference between the last version and version prior to 22.0.0, any bugfixes about Circles for NC21 and older version should be applied to stable21.


### Bring cloud-users closer together

Circles allow your users to create their own groups of users/colleagues/friends. 
Those groups of users (or circles) can then be used by any other app for sharing purpose 
 through the Circles API
