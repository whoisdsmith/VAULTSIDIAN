## Overview

This interface allows you to select metrics programs to process your log files and provide traffic analysis for your account’s domains.

Note:

-   Your hosting provider controls whether you can select a statistics program in WHM’s [_Statistics Software Configuration_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/server-configuration/statistics-software-configuration) interface (_WHM >> Home >> Server Configuration >> Statistics Software Configuration_).
-   If your hosting provider does not allow you to select a statistics program, the interface displays a lock icon (
