## Things to Keep In Mind

While it is best practice to always use the most recent version of PHP, it is important to check the compatibility of your site against new versions of PHP before upgrading. Sites built with WordPress can use the [PHP Compatibility Checker plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/php-compatibility-checker/).  
 

## Updating PHP Version

Our System allows you to run PHP scripts in a few different ways. You will see these options on the version selection page. Once [logged into your cPanel:](https://www.bluehost.com/hosting/cpanel)
