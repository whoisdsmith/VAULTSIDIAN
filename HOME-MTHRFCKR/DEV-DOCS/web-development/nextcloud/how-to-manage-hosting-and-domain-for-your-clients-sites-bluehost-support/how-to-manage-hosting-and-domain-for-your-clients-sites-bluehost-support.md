# How to Manage Hosting and Domain for your Clients' Sites | Bluehost Support

---
## Getting Started

Once your site is approved by your client for WP admin and hosting level access, you will be able to manage your clients’ Bluehost hosting account. This will allow you to access only the My Sites section, the domains tab, and the advanced tab i.e., cPanel of the Bluehost account.

Once you have added your clients’ site and also received the approval, you will then have access to the WP admin and the Bluehost hosting account of that site. To see how to add and request access to a site, visit this KB article: [How to add and manage WordPress website](https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/maestro-websites).  
Clicking on **Manage Hosting** will take you to the **Advanced** tab of the hosting account of the site, from where you can access the cPanel.
