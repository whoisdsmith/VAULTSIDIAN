## Overview

The _Analog Stats_ interface allows you to access data from the Analog traffic statistics software. Analog compiles traffic statistics for your domain, and organizes the data by month so that it is easy for you to manage and interpret. The software also presents the data for each month in graphs to show additional categories.

## View Analog Stats

To view Analogâ€™s statistics for a domain, perform the following steps:

1.  Click _View_ for the domain that you wish to view. A new browser tab that lists each month for which Analog contains traffic statistics will appear.
2.  Select the month for which you wish to view traffic statistics. The interface will display the Analog software statistics for that month.
