## Overview

The _Webalizer FTP_ interface displays traffic statistics from the Webalizer statistics program about who has visited your site using the FTP protocol.

Important:

This interface **only** appears in your cPanel account if your hosting provider selects the _Webalizer_ feature in WHM’s [_Feature Manager_](https://docs.cpanel.net/whm/packages/feature-manager) interface (_WHM >> Home >> Packages >> Feature Manager_).

## View your Webalizer FTP statistics

To view your domain’s FTP statistics, click _View_ next to the domain that you wish to view. A new interface will appear that displays a graph and a summary of the FTP traffic statistics for that domain.

To view detailed statistics for a month, click that month’s link. A new interface will appear that displays charts and tables with the following information:

-   Daily and hourly statistics in graphs and tables.
-   The links through which visitors access your website.
-   HTTP codes.
