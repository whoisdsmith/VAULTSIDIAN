_This list is not complete and only report which apps have been tested with Nextcloud Social._

## Configuration

Nextcloud Social, being an app for Nextcloud, is hosted in the `apps/` folder and not at the root of the domain meaning the path to the app needs to be configured:
When prompted, use `your-nextcloud/apps/social` as the address of the remote instance of Fediverse.

However, as shown in the table above, some clients will not allow you to add a path to the address of the instance.
