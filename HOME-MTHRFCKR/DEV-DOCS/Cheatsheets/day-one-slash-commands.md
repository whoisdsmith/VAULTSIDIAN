Slash Commands are now available for quick keyboard shortcut inputs to insert the current time `/time`, today’s date `/date`, tomorrow’s date `/tomorrow`, Todo checkbox `/todo`, Rule line `/line`, and even header styles `/h1` – `/h6`

`/time` - Time

`/date` - current date in MM/DD/YY format

`/today` - current date in MM/DD/YY format

`/tomorrow` - next date in MM/DD/YY format

`/yesterday` - previous date in MM/DD/YY format

`/today-full` - current date in day, month, date, year format

`/tomorrow-full` - next date in day, month, date, year format

`/yesterday-full` - previous date in day, month, date, year format

`/now` - date and time

`/now-full` - full date and time

`/todo` - start a checklist

`/line` - add a horizontal line

`/h1` - Initiate heading 1. This also works for `/h2` - `/h6`

## macOS

In an entry on macOS, start typing the slash `/` an the suggestions will appear for the Slash Commands.
