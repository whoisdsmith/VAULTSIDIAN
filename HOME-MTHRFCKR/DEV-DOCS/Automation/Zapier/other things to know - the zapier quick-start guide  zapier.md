Now that your Zap is running and taking care of tasks for you, learn a bit more about your account, choosing the right plan, and advanced features.

## Zap History

Zapier keeps track of all the tasks your Zaps attempt. You can see which tasks were successful, and which tasks were unsuccessful. Think of Zap History like Zap receipts.

## Zapier plans

Zapier has [different types of plans](https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans) for your automation needs. Each plan will give you a certain number of tasks to use each month. If you have a lot of Zaps or need a lot of tasks, you may need a higher-tier plan, while folks who only automate one or two things may benefit from a simpler plan.

How do you figure out which plan you need? When you first sign up for Zapier, you get a [14-day free trial](https://zapier.com/help/account/billing-pricing/understand-your-free-zapier-trial) of our paid features. Create your first Zaps and as you near the end of your trial, look back at what you've made and how many tasks you're using. This will help you figure out which plan is right for you.
