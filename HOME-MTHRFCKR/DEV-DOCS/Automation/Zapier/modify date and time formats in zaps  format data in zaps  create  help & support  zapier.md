You can use [Formatterâ€™s](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/get-started-with-formatter) Date/Time transform to change dates and times in your Zap. The Date/Time transform can reformat dates and times or add/subtract time from existing date/time data.

If you have an app that formats dates as MM/DD/YYYY but you need to send it to an app that formats dates as DD/MM/YYYY, you can use the Date/Time transform to change the date format.

## [1\. Add a Formatter step](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/modify-date-and-time-formats-in-zaps#add-a-formatter-step)
