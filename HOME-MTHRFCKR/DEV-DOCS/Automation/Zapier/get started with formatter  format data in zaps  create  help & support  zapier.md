Formatter is Zapier’s built-in utility tool for transforming text, numbers, and other data into the format you need. Use Formatter when you need data in a different format than the format it’s coming in from your trigger or another step.

You have a Zap that sends new PayPal customers to a MailChimp mailing list. PayPal shows your customers' full names and the detailed time and date they bought your product—but all you want is their first name and the day of the week. With Formatter, you can extract and format text the way you want before adding it to MailChimp.
