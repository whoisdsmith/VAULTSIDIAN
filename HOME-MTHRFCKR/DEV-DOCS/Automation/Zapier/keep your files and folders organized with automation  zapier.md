Files have a knack for getting out of control, fast. Whether it's on your computer or in your cloud storage app, files are rarely where you _think_ you saved them—if you even saved them at all. (Looking at you, email attachments.) 

You don't have to resign yourself to a life of digital chaos, but you also shouldn't spend all your energy on meticulous organization either. While Zapier can't rename or move your existing files—you're on your own for clean-up duty—we _can_ help you prevent future file messes.  

Make your business more efficient with Zapier

We've collected a few pre-made workflows to help you automatically save important email attachments, create folders and files when you need them, and more. Just click on a template to get started, and we'll guide you through the set-up process. You can also [read more about setting up Zaps](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/create-zaps).

Zapier helps you automate the tedious tasks in your day, like file management, by connecting web apps. Our automatic workflows, which we call Zaps, send information from one app to another, helping you reduce manual tasks.

## Save email attachments automatically

I know I mentioned cloud storage and your computer as two dumping grounds for files, but many of us use our email inbox as an unofficial third storage option. While I'm not one to judge life choices, this isn't a good one. Not only are you eating up precious email storage, but there's also a risk that you'll accidentally delete an important attachment you never saved.

These Zaps will save you the hassle of remembering to right-click and save attachments to your cloud storage app.

Use a [filter step](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/add-conditions-to-zaps-with-filters)—available on our [paid plans](https://zapier.com/app/billing/plans)—to filter the file types you'd like to save. For example, if you only want to save PDF files. 

## Copy your favorite social media posts

Social media is mercurial. A post you liked one day may be hard to find the next day. Whether you're a content creator, marketer, or a human with a social media account, you can keep a copy of photos, videos, recordings, and other post content automatically. Try these workflows to copy and store files in your cloud storage app. 

## Back up your important files

Backing up files is that healthy tech habit we know we're supposed to do, but put off doing it until something catastrophic happens. 

Don't let accidental deletion or syncing errors be the reason you start keeping backups. These Zaps will copy and store text from those important emails, notes, and other files. 

## Create new folders and files for projects

It's common to have a process for handling files in regards to a project or client. For example, maybe you use the same templates for each project, and every project has its own folder. 

Instead of manually creating and copying the same structure, you can use a Zap to create folders and new documents whenever you need it. 

If you work with tools we haven't mentioned, don't worry! Zapier works with thousands of apps, so you can automate almost any task at work. Head to our [App Directory](https://zapier.com/apps) and search for the one you use, or browse to find the right solution for your needs.
