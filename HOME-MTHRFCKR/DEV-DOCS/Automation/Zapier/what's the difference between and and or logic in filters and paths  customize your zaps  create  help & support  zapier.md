There are two types of logic for multiple filter or path rules: AND and OR.

## [AND logic](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/whats-the-difference-between-and-and-or-logic-in-filters-and-paths#and-logic)

To identify objects that meet _all_ criteria within a set of filter or path rules, use **AND** logic. For example, if you want to identify new emails containing the words 'Help' AND 'Urgent' in the subject, click **AND** before adding the second rule.

## [OR logic](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/whats-the-difference-between-and-and-or-logic-in-filters-and-paths#or-logic)

To identify objects that meet _at least one_ criteria within a set of filter or path rules, use **OR** logic. For example, if you want to identify new emails containing the words 'Help' OR 'Urgent' in the subject, click **OR** before adding the second rule.
