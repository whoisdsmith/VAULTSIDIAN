[Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) is a markup language that web pages on the internet use. In HTML, elements describe how a browser should display the content on a web page. HTML tags wrap elements, with the tags telling the page where an element starts and ends.

With [Formatter](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/get-started-with-formatter), you can use the _Text_ extract function to remove any HTML tags from your data. This is useful if an app needs plain language instead of HTML.

After removing HTML tags from your data, you can use the plain text in further actions in your Zap.
