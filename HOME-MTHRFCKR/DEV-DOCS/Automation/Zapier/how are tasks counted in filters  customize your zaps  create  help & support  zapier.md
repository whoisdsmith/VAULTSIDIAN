Only incoming data that meets a [filter's](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/add-conditions-to-zaps-with-filters) rules count as tasks. If incoming data that triggers a Zap doesn't pass the filter, it does not count as a task, and will not count against your [monthly task limit](https://zapier.com/help/manage/history/learn-about-tasks-in-zapier#step-2).

If you have multiple filter steps in a Zap, each filter step that allows incoming data to pass through counts as a task. For example, if you have two filters in a Zap, and incoming data passes the first filter but not the second filter, one task will be counted.

In [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history/), filter steps have the status _Filtered_ if the incoming data did not pass the filter and the Zap run was stopped, and the status _Successful_ if the incoming data passed the filter and the Zap run continued.
