Schedule by Zapier is a built-in feature of Zapier that lets you set up a Zap to run at a specific interval. Typically, Zaps only run when a trigger event occurs in an app. With schedule triggers, you can choose to run your Zap every month, week, day, or hour.

For example, you might want to add a new task to your task management app at the start of every week to set your weekly goals. You can set up a Zap using a schedule trigger that runs every Monday at 11 AM, then add an action step to add the new task to your task management app.

Schedule triggers use the [timezone set in your account](https://zapier.com/app/settings/profile). For example, if your schedule trigger is set in the exact hour that the switch to Daylight Savings Time happens, the Zap won't trigger as the time technically did not occur.  
If your the Zap continues running in UTC time, turn your Zap off and on to reset the timezone.

If you want to base your Zap on a recurring event that doesn't occur at regular intervals, you can use [Google Calendar's _Event Start_ trigger](https://zapier.com/apps/google-calendar/help) to run your Zap when the recurring event starts.

If you want more granular control over when your schedule trigger runs, you can pair it with [filters](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/add-conditions-to-zaps-with-filters) and [delays](https://zapier.com/help/create/customize/add-delays-to-zaps). For example, if you want to run your Zap on a specific day of the week with some exceptions, you can add a filter so your Zap only runs then.

Once youâ€™ve set up your trigger, you can set up the rest of your Zap such as as [add an action](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/set-up-your-zap-action) or a [search step](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/search-for-existing-data-in-zaps).
