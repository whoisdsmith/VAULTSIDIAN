## About troubleshooting

We'll provide some basic troubleshooting steps below, but check out the communities of IFTTT experts on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ifttt/) or [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/ifttt) to see if your problem is known or being experienced by other users.

## Refresh your connection to the service

1.  Head to [https://ifttt.com/my\_services](https://ifttt.com/my_services) or the mobile app and locate the service you're having trouble with
2.  Click ⚙︎ **Settings** on the top right
3.  Click **Reconnect**
4.  You'll be taken to a page where you can reconnect the service to [[IFTTT]]

## Remove / reconnect service

If refreshing the connection didn't work, try reconnecting the service. This often helps with issues such as drop-down menus not populating, or authentication issues with the service.

To reconnect the service, follow the steps above, but this time click **Remove**. Disconnecting your service may disable related Applets and connections on your [[IFTTT]] account so be prepared to reconnect them afterward.

## Search for service-specific tips online

Search **\[service name\] IFTTT help** online - it's possible that the service has specific requirements for how to use [[IFTTT]]. For example, some services only offer [[IFTTT]] support with certain plans on their product.

## Double-check the trigger and action fields

Verify that the intended Ingredients are being used where and how they should be. For example, don't use a filename ingredient for an image action field.

## Test a variety of configurations

When triggering a connection for testing purposes, you can use the "Check now" button on the card to force the Applet to check for a trigger. If you ever see a **Cannot check Applet** error, it means something is preventing it from running. Make sure it is set up using the correct fields and ingredients.

## Check your Activity Feed

This will show you are any error messages there that can help you understand what is preventing your connection from running. There is an [error glossary](https://help.ifttt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004914234-Activity-feed-error-glossary-) that can help you better understand errors in your feed. If a specific service returning an error, try refreshing your connection to that service.

## IoT devices (smart home products, voice assistants, etc) 

If you are using a connection with an IoT device that is not running successfully, try a full reset of the device, double-check that you have connected [[IFTTT]] to the same device account where it is registered, and ensure your internet connection is strong. Also, confirm that your device is [[IFTTT]] compatible.

## File Not Found error

This likely means that a required field in an Applet is empty or not filled out with the correct ingredient. Check your Applet settings to see if they can be modified. More info about this error can be found [here](https://ift.tt/fnf).

## Where to go for further help

If the above information doesn't help to get your Applet working, please contact the service owner. Most services on the [[IFTTT]] platform have tools to help them diagnose user issues as they come up. You can often locate a service's support info by searching for **\[service name\] IFTTT help** online.
