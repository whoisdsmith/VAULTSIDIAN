### Blank lines

[Blank lines](https://github.github.com/gfm/#blank-lines) between block-level elements are ignored, except for the role they play in determining whether a [list](https://github.github.com/gfm/#list) is [tight](https://github.github.com/gfm/#tight) or [loose](https://github.github.com/gfm/#loose).  
Blank lines at the beginning and end of the document are also ignored.
