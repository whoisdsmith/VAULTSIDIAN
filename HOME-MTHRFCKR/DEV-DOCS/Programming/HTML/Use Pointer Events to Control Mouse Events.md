## Use Pointer Events to Control Mouse Events

[Pointer events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/pointer-events) allow you to specify how the mouse interacts with the element it's touching. To disable the default pointer event on a button, for instance:

```css
.button-disabled {
  opacity: .5;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

It's that simple.
