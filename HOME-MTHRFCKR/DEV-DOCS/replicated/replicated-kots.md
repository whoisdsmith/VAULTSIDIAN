# Replicated Kots


## Introduction 

> KOTS is a kubectl plugin to help manage Kubernetes Off-The-Shelf software. The Kots plugin runs locally, on any computer that has kubectl installed. Kots doesnâ€™t run in a cluster, but it helps manage the preflight, install, support and upgrade process of third party software in Kubernetes.
