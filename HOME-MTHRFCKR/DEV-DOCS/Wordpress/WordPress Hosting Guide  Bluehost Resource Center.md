## What is WordPress?

![](https://www.bluehost.com//static/img/library/pages/resources/wordpress-guide/laptop-phone-ipad-628.png)

Simply put, WordPress is the world’s most popular platform for building a website.

Why? It’s easy to get started, simple to use, and unbelievably flexible. From stunning portfolios to [online stores](https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress/woocommerce-hosting) to simple WordPress blogs, everyone can build the site of their dreams (whatever it may be) and with hardly any help along the way. But we’ll get more into all that in a moment with our WordPress guide.

### The Ultimate Content Management System

WordPress is a content management system, or CMS for short, which means that while you provide all the content that makes up your site (such as images, text, videos, etc.), the platform does all the coding and organizing for you — so you don’t have to be experienced to build a beautiful, functional website.

### Open Source, Open Use

Since WordPress is open source, that means you’re free to modify and build upon its software. Thousands of volunteers the world over work to improve the platform every day, and it’s free to use without paying a licensing fee.

### Evolution & History

Since its birth in 2003, WordPress has evolved from a simple blogging tool to the most popular content management system on the web, running over a quarter of the world’s websites.

<table><tbody><tr><td>May 2003</td><td>WordPress is launched by college freshmen Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little.</td></tr><tr><td>Aug 2006</td><td>The first WordCamp is held in San Francisco, CA.</td></tr><tr><td>Dec 2008</td><td>WordPress reaches 500,000+ downloads</td></tr><tr><td>Nov 2011</td><td>WordCamp grows to 52 events worldwide.</td></tr><tr><td>Dec 2011</td><td>WordPress.org claims 22% of all new and active domains.</td></tr><tr><td>Dec 2012</td><td>The WordPress.org community grows to 20,000+ people.</td></tr><tr><td>June 2014</td><td>25 million downloads.</td></tr><tr><td>Oct 2014</td><td>WordPress is published in 120 languages.</td></tr></tbody></table>

On top of looking good, WordPress provides you with the ability to expand your site’s overall functionality through plugins.

## WordPress.org vs. WordPress.com

What’s the difference? You’re not alone if you’ve ever been confused about this one. So let’s get straight to it:

The biggest difference between WordPress.org and WordPress.com comes down to who is hosting your site.

With WordPress.org, you host the site yourself — meaning you download the WordPress software and install it on your own web server, wherever that may be. With WordPress.com, the hosting is provided for you right on WordPress’s own servers.

There are more differences than simply who is hosting your site of course, so we broke them down for you in this quick guide:

| .COM | .ORG |
| --- | --- |
| Free Account | WordPress software is still free,  
but you need to pay for a web host. |
| Hosted with WordPress | Hosted with your web host of choice. |
| Free & Premium Themes Available | Free Themes + Premium Themes +  
Custom Themes + Build Your Own |
| Limited Functionality | Unlimited Functionality  
through use of Plugins |
| Limited Customization | Fully Customizable |
| WordPress-Maintained | Self-Maintained |

### Our Recommendations

If you’re interested in creating a simple, no-frills blog, WordPress.com is a great solution — but you’ll be limited in your ability to tweak its appearance and functionality.

If you want to take full advantage of all WordPress has to offer — such as a personalized domain name, plugins, custom themes — WordPress.org is clearly the way to go. You simply need to install WordPress on your own hosting server, like the kind you get at Bluehost.com. This gives you free rein to personalize and grow your site exactly how you’d like.

### 20 Terms You Should Know

Not everyone can be a web expert, but it helps to at least know the basics. Here’s our list of the top 20 web-related terms you are most likely to stumble upon as you enter the world of WordPress.

#### Backups

A replica of your website that is either stored on your server or in another location. Creating frequent backups is always a good idea should your site ever become infected with malware.

#### CMS

CMS stands for content management system, which is a fancy way of describing a software application or tool that one can use to design, manage, and publish a website without having to know how to code.

#### CSS

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style language that is used to write formatting instructions or rules that tell your browser how your content should look in terms of layout and style.

#### Dashboard

The first screen you see when logging into your WordPress account. This is where the magic happens — you can quickly access all your site’s content, user permissions, account settings, plugin management, and more.

#### Domain Name

Just a fancy word for your website’s address, or URL; e.g. www.yourwebsite.com

#### Google Analytics

A Google-powered service that gives you insight into 1) the performance of your website (such as how long visitors stick around, what pages are most popular, etc.) and 2) the nature of your visitors (such as geographic location, traffic sources, etc.). Google Analytics is a popular plugin that can be added to your WordPress account.

#### HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is written in tags (for example:)  
and is the language in which your website is written. This “hidden” code can take months to learn and is one of the reasons so many people use a content management system, such as WordPress, to build their site as it saves them from ever having to learn code.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that’s used to make web pages interactive — think quizzes and polls.

#### Malware

Any software that is intended to harm your computer system, whether it’s a virus, spyware, worm, or other form of harmful bug.

#### Media Library

Any images, videos, or recordings that you upload to be used on your WordPress website are kept in the media library, accessible through your dashboard.

#### Pages

Any single page of content that lives on your website. Pages typically have their own place in the navigation and common examples include the “About Us”, “Contact Us, etc. sections of your website.

#### Permalinks

A permanent link that always directs visitors to the same page. In blogging, for example, much content is posted directly on the homepage, pushing older posts down. Once these posts are archived, a permalink provides an alternate and permanent way to view the post on its own separate page.

#### Plugins

A software that can be integrated with your WordPress account to extend your website’s functionality. [Learn more about plugins >](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wordpress-for-beginners/are-wordpress-plugins-free-10176/)

#### Posts

As opposed to a page, a post (in WordPress terms) is specifically relevant to blogs and make up the majority of their content. Every time you publish a new content entry, this is considered a post.

#### SSL Certificate

If you’re starting an [online store](https://www.bluehost.com/wordpress-woocommerce), an SSL certificate is necessary to reduce the risk of your customers’ credit card information (and other private data) being stolen.

#### SEO

Stands for Search Engine Optimization. This is the strategy of increasing the amount of traffic to your website by boosting its rank on search result pages. There is no exact formula for how to rank higher, but there are plenty of [agreed-upon tactics](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/seo/tips-tricks-improving-seo-wordpress-website-6785/) that are known to help.

#### Tags

Allows you to group related blog posts together based on their content, such as “recipes”, “travel tips”, or “products I love”.

#### Themes

Themes allow you to change the look and style of your website without changing the underlying content or software. You can choose from thousands of WordPress themes — from simple to ornate — to find one that best matches your style, or just custom build one yourself. [Learn more about themes >](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/wordpress-for-beginners/change-your-wordpress-theme-9239/)

#### Web Host

A web host stores the files that make up your website on high-powered computers, called servers, so you don’t have to. [Hosting your site on a server](https://www.bluehost.com/managed-wordpress-hosting) keeps your website working 24/7 and connected to the rest of the internet.

#### Widgets

Widgets, like plugins, add functionality to your website — specifically on your sidebar. Examples of widgets include a calendar, search bar, tag cloud, and more.
