#### How to prepare my own CSV file?

</summary>

If you want to upload your own CSV file just make sure:

- Comma delimited
- Columns: `url`, `folder`, `title`, `description`, `tags`, `created`
- `url` column is required, other are optional
- use `/` to specify nested `folder`, like `a/b/c`
- to have multiple `tags` just put them in quotes, like `"tag1, tag2"`
- `created` column should have Unix timestamp or date in ISO 8601 format
- Column order doesn't matter

Here an example CSV file:
```csv
folder,url,title,description,tags,created
"Folder",http://google.com,Google,"Search engine","search, app",1629980125
"Folder/Nested folder",http://yahoo.com,Yahoo,"Another search engine","search, app",1629980125
```

[Validate your CSV](https://csvlint.io/) file before uploading!

### TXT
Txt file should have a url per row

### ENEX (Evernote)
You can transfer all your web-clips (bookmarks) from Evernote to Raindrop.io, description and tags will be imported as well.
Be sure to select `ENEX` as a file format of [export in Evernote](https://help.evernote.com/hc/en-us/articles/209005557-Export-notes-and-notebooks).

### Pinterest
Pinterest itself doesn't have any tools to export your data. But you can try to use great third-party app called [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) that can help you download export file.
Just follow instructions on [Pinback](https://pinbackit.github.io/) site.

## Settings
Before you start import, please select how much data you want to transfer:

Mode | Description
---- | -----------
**Only new folders and bookmarks** | When you upload the same import file again but with new data, this mode will prevent uploading duplicates and ensure structure untouched, only new folders and bookmarks will be imported. <br/><br/> If you not sure select this mode
**Import all** | Select this mode if you want to import everything as is (including duplicates)
**Start from scratch** | This mode is the best way to clean your account data completely and replace it with data from import file. <br/> Be sure if you already have any data in Raindrop it will be removed and replaced.

## Limitations
- We support files up to 50Mb in size. If you have a larger file:
    1. [Optimize](https://optimize-bookmarks-html.glitch.me/)
    2. And upload to Raindrop as ZIP archive
- Evernote attachments are not supported yet
