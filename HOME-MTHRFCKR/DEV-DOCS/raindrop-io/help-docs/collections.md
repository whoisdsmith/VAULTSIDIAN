# Collections

---

## Introduction

Collections are essentially just folders.
Whether you’re planning a presentation, preparing for an event or creating a website, create a collection so all the important items are saved in one central place.

![](using/collections/collections.jpg)Each collection have a unique icon selected from thousands [searchable icons library](#change-icon).
You can choose [v[view modes](bookmarks.md#appearance)o fit your needs better and make your content shine: list, grid, headlines or masonry.

Also, you can choose to [h[hide labels](bookmarks.md#appearance)because sometimes images speak louder than words),
[d[drag to reorder](bookmarks.md#sort)our items, or [s[sort your items](bookmarks.md#sort)y date, title, and kind.

Collections and items are **private by default**.
It means only you can access them.

Make it [public](#public-collections) or [shared](#shared-collections) to enable access for other people.

### Unsorted collection

</summary>

The `Unsorted` is your default collection in Raindrop.io. When you add an item, it goes straight to your Unsorted unless you specify that the item goes into a specific collection.

This collection is useful to temporarily put new items in it and sort them later.

### Nested collections

</summary>

Nested collections give your an extra level of flexibility and power.

<p><img src={require('./nested.png').default} style={{maxHeight:289}} /></p>

Keep your ever-growing collections list neat and organized with nested collections.
For example, you might create "parent" collection called `Music` and put `Pop`, `Rock` and `Electronic` underneath.

:::info
Nested collections are only available in [P[Pro plan](premium-features.md)::

You can collapse sub-collections under their "parent" to temporarily hide them from view.
This helps to focus on the right collections at the right time, without getting distracted by everything else.

Nested collections are also a great way to share multiple collections at once.
When you share a "parent" all of it sub-collections become accessible by collaborators automatically.

### Trash collection

</summary>

When you remove an bookmark or file, they are moved to the `Trash` special collection.
You can restore an item from the `Trash` to your library by moving it to any other collection.
You can delete an item permanently by clicking the trash icon (or by right-clicking and choosing `Remove`).

### Groups

</summary>

Groups help you split your collections list into smaller chunks.
For example, you might create "Work" and "Home" groups and then organize various collections underneath each one.
