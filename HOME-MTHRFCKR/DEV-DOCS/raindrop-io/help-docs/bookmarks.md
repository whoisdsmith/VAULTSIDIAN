### Change thumbnail

</summary>

When you add something, Raindrop.io will try to pull in an image from the site.

Either way, it’s easy to change an image you hate.

To change a thumbnail of an item click on `Edit` button and then click on a thumbnail.

![](using/bookmarks/buttons.png)

If there are other images on the bookmarked webpage that Raindrop.io can pull from the site, they will be showed in grid.
