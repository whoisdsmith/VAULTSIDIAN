Try to completely reinstall Raindrop.io app this way:

1. Open `Settings` app
2. Go to `General` / `iPhone Storage` / `Raindrop.io`
3. Tap `Delete app`

This action will remove Raindrop.io app completely (including any cached data).
Now just install Raindrop.io app again. This should fix any issues with extension.
