## [GistPad](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gistfs)

> Allows you to manage GitHub Gists entirely within the editor. You can open, create, delete, fork, star and clone gists, and then seamlessly begin editing files as if they were local. It's like your very own developer library for building and referencing code snippets, commonly used config/scripts, programming-related notes/documentation, and interactive samples.
