# Travis Concepts

# What Is Continuous Integration (CI)? 
Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently - rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments. This is where Travis CI comes in.

# What is Travis CI ?
Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test projects hosted at GitHub. Travis CI automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a GitHub repository that is using Travis CI, and each time this happens, it will try to build the project and run tests.

# What does Travis do?
Travis CI offers following benefits:
You can monitor GitHub projects
Runs Test and generate results quickly. Parallel test execution is possible.
Build artifacts & check code quality
Easy Deployment to cloud services
It can identify small as well as large code changes.
Developers can use Travis CI to watch the tests when they are running.
The tool integrates with Slack, HipChat, Email, etc.
