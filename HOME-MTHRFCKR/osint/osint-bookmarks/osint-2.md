[Nate Warfield - We Can't Stop Here! This is Bot Country!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=MicrosoftIsraelR%26DCenter&feature=youtu.be&v=i7iYcv1XZjA)

Every day the internet is scanned & probed by a quarter of a million IP addresses - some of this traffic is benign, but most (around 60%) is malicious. High-profile names like Mirai and EternalBlue receive most of the media attention, but they're in the "Devil you know" category. What I find more fascinating are the ports and services which are inexplicably "interesting" and the networks looking for them. In this talk, I'll dive into: The tools I use to monitor automated scans Patterns I've observed over the last 18 months Which networks are the most aggressive and their targets of choice How organizations can leverage my hunting tactics to better defend & respond to threats in their own environments This is important because even today, in 2020, significant vectors for compromise are poor network security hygiene, patching, access control and weak or nonexistent authentication. While zero-day exploits receive most of the media attention, most networks are compromised through completely avoidable security mistakes. I'll demonstrate the strategies I use to fingerprint and identify at-risk VMs in Azure which have proven effective when hunting risk against an attack surface of 2.8 million internet-exposed IP addresses. The same methodologies can be applied by anyone with an internet footprint and are a critical part of responding to new vulnerabilities, attack campaigns and finding compromised hosts in your environment. The techniques are environment-agnostic, effective across all cloud providers and don't require anything more than accounts with a few OSINT providers.

[Benjamin Strick's Guide to Custom Maps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?ab_channel=Bendobrown&v=bJkV3l5Haq0)

This tutorial is part 10 of the OSINT At Home series. It covers how to make custom maps with publicly available data on anything. For example, you can create a map like this one I have created on public water fountains and public toilets in London, which I use to plan my runs: https://maphub.net/bendobrown/london-runners-helper I have also included a few examples in the video, such as mapping CCTV cameras in Munich, or gas well sites in Australia. Please do look around the wiki that I have linked to, as there are lots of opportunities to collect and map data based on what you are investigating, researching, or interested in. The tutorial specifically covers the use of Overpass Turbo, which allows you to query the Open Street Map (OSM) database and export those points as a KML, GPX, GeoJSON or other file types so that you can load it into Google Earth or any other map platform you use. I have also covered some frequently asked questions in this tutorial, such as how to put a kml or kmz file in Google Earth, which is as simple as a ‘drag and drop’, and I have also covered how you can upload these datasets into a free to use platform called MapHub, where you can create public or team maps for your hobbies, research or projects. It should be noted that all data, from any source, should be verified before being relied upon. For example, I checked the locations of CCTV cameras or water drinking points by viewing them through Google Street view. However, there may be some limitations to it as some of those amenities might be closed or removed – so always good to check your data. The OSINT At Home series is useful for those looking to find digital breadcrumbs and pick up some methods of open source intelligence (OSINT), digital investigations and good old plain research. No matter who you are, or where you are in the world, you can follow these tutorials from home with publicly available information to answer questions such as who, what, where and when.
