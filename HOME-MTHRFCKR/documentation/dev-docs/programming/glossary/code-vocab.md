# 38 Coding Terms | Computer Programming Vocabulary & Beginners Glossary

## Coding terminology

Here are some popular coding terms to become familiar with.

### Algorithm

An [algorithm](https://www.idtech.com/blog/algorithms-for-kids) is a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. It's a computer's thought process.

### Argument

An [argument](https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-is-an-argument-in-programming) is a way to provide more information to a function. The function can then use that information as it runs, like a variable (For more info on variables, see below.)

### Arrays

Arrays are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the animals in cages are the variables inside. 

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are essential in almost every application, especially in games. If a game character earns experience, it needs to be added to the total earned. If an arrow hits an enemy, the damage the enemy takes needs to be calculated.

### Assignment operators

Assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=) are operators that combine variable assignments (=) with arithmetic operators. They serve as a shortcut when coders have to perform an operation that changes the value of a variable. If a rock falls on a game player's head, health needs to be subtracted from their total, and so on.

### Augmented reality

Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience where digital objects are placed in a real-world environment in real time. While _virtual_ reality creates a completely artificial environment, augmented reality uses the existing real-world environment and overlays new information on top of it. _Pokémon Go_ is a popular example, blending the real world captured through your phone’s camera with virtual characters overlaid on top.

### Autonomous

Autonomous robot, self-driving car, and delivery bot are all terms used to describe robots that navigate their environments using sensors with little to no human interaction.

### Binary numbers

A binary number is a computer's way to represent information. Computers process millions of 1's and 0's a minute using different rules to interpret them as numbers, letters, operators, and everything else put into a computer.

### Bit

The individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits. 

### C++

C++ is a low-level yet versatile programming language. Kids who master this language will be able to solve complex problems and understand how programs work.

### Camel case

Variables should be named using camel case, meaning the first word of the name is lowercase and each new word after that is capitalized. It's called camel case because when it was originally written as CamelCase, the capital Cs look like the humps on a camel. iPhone, eBay, YouTube, and of course, iD in “iD Tech” are real-world examples of camel casing!

### Coding

Coding is how people create instructions for computers to follow. Just like people speak different languages, so do programs. For instance, Roblox uses the [coding language Lua](https://www.idtech.com/blog/lua-coding-for-kids) while Minecraft was built with Java. 

### Coding languages 

Computers use coding languages to understand what people want them to do. Just like how people communicate with each other in English or Japanese, people communicate with computers in languages like C++ or Java. Some of the [best coding languages for kids](https://www.idtech.com/blog/choose-best-programming-language-your-child) include JavaScript, Scratch, and Python.

### Computer program

A computer program is a group of instructions given to a computer to be processed. These instructions are typically used to solve a problem, or make long problems for humans shorter and easier.

### Conditional statements

Conditional statements evaluate to true or false. Use them to print information or move programs forward in different situations.

### Else statements

Else statements are used to do something else when the condition in the if statement isn't true.

### For loops

For loops allow you to run a block of code repeatedly, just like while loops. However, for loops run a block of code a set number of times. (Remember, while loops run an unknown or unspecified amount of times; more on that below.)

### Functions

A function is a block of code that can be referenced by name to run the code it contains. 

### If statements

An if statement runs a block of code based on whether or not a condition is true.

### Integrated Development Environment 

Software such as [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is where you type your code and run your programs. Basically, an IDE is software that makes coding simpler.

### IntelliJ

To start writing code in Java, you can use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), an IDE created for writing and running code.

### Java

Java is a powerful multi-platform programming language. It's used for many professional and commercial applications, including every Android application and even the Android operating system itself! 

Minecraft was completely developed in Java by Markus Persson. Gmail was created in Java because Java has a great performance rate and a good framework for web. 

When it comes to [Java for kids](https://www.idtech.com/blog/java-for-kids-a-guide-for-parents-of-new-coders), they can use Java to make a wide range of games and programs.

### Jupyter Notebook

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a type of Integrated Development Environment. Jupyter handles Python specifically.

### Linux

Linux is an open-source operating system designed to run on multiple types of devices, like laptops, phones, tablets, robots, and many others. In fact, the Android operating system is based on Linux!

### Loops

Loops check a condition and then run a code block. The loop will continue to check and run until a specified condition is reached. 

### Main function

The main function is part of C++ and is called when the program starts.

### Machine learning

Machine learning is getting a computer to act without explicitly being programmed to do so. It's an application of artificial intelligence where we give machines access to data and let them use that data to learn for themselves. Learn more about [machine learning for kids](https://www.idtech.com/blog/intro-to-machine-learning-kids-teens). 

### Micro:bit

The [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/guide/) is a small programmable computer more formally known as a microcontroller development board. 

### Neural networks

Machine learning is all about training an algorithm. In order to train an algorithm, neural networks are needed, which are sets of algorithms that are inspired by biological neural networks. A neural network is the "brain" of the program.

### Python

Python is a programming language that’s currently becoming more and more powerful with every new [library](https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-are-libraries-in-coding) added to its collection. It handles everything from web development and game design, to machine learning and AI. Python is known for having syntax that's simpler and easier to write than many other languages like Java and C++.

### Scripts

In programming, a series of scripts, or sets of steps, are written for a computer to follow. Computers process the steps line-by-line from top to bottom. Each step is created by writing a statement.

### Sprites

Sprites are computer graphics that you can move via code; a 2D player that walks is an animated sprite. For kids, [Scratch sprites](https://www.idtech.com/blog/what-are-scratch-sprites) provide a fun intro to coding. 

### Statement

The way you tell a computer to perform an action is by giving it instructions or writing statements to explain a desired action. Again, it’s similar to writing sentences in English, but with words, numbers, and punctuation added depending on the programming language.

### TensorFlow

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a library developed by Google to facilitate the creation and training of machine learning models and neural networks.

### Training

Training is the process of feeding huge amounts of data into an algorithm so the algorithm can adjust and improve, as if it's learning.

### Variable

A variable is a container that holds a single number, word, or other information that you can use throughout a program. A variable is like a chest you can fill with different values. You name the chests so you can find them later. Variables have three parts: type, name, and value.

### Variable types

Once a variable is declared, a variable type is specified. Basic variable types include: string (words and phrases), char (short for “character;” a single letter or symbol you can type), int (short for “integer;” for whole numbers), double or float (for decimal numbers), and bool (short for “boolean;” for true or false values).

### While loops

While loops are set up just like if statements. They check for a condition and run the code in them until the condition is no longer true. A while loop will run forever (until the condition is false).
