Hitting `CMD-F` opens the find view which searches across the terminal (scoped within the current pane).

-   Find is bottom-up: the search starts from the bottom of the terminal. The first match is the most recent one.
    

-   Since command outputs are contained within Blocks, you can still use the input editor when invoking find.
