# The Input / Text Editor - Warp Documentation

> ## Excerpt
> Warp supports modern keyboard and mouse bindings like multiple cursors and clicking and dragging text. Warp is also backwards-compatible to the normal terminal bindings (emacs), e.g. we support CTRL-A and CTRL-E to move to the start and end of a line respectively. To see all the editor shortcuts head to Keyboard Shortcuts or click CMD-P to open the Command Palette.

Warp supports modern keyboard and mouse bindings like multiple cursors and clicking and dragging text. Warp is also backwards-compatible to the normal terminal bindings (emacs), e.g. we support `CTRL-A` and `CTRL-E` to move to the start and end of a line respectively. To see all the editor shortcuts head to [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://docs.warp.dev/features/keyboard_shortcuts) or click `CMD-P` to open the [Command Palette](https://docs.warp.dev/features/command_palette).
