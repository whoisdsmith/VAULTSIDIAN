## What is automation?

**Automation** is simply setting something up to run automatically. Automation is all around you, even if you don't realize it. Take your smartphone, for example. You receive alerts whenever you receive a text message, a voice mail, or an email.

The heart of any automation boils down to a simple command: WHEN and DO. "**When** this happens, **do** that." Even the most complex automation can be broken down into this simple command.

For example:

## What is Zapier?

Zapier is a tool that helps you automate repetitive tasks between two or more appsâ€”no code necessary. **When** an event happens in one app, Zapier can tell another app to perform (or **do**) a particular action.

## What should/can I automate with Zapier?

-   **Tasks you have to do frequently.** Example: Sending a weekly reminder to your team to fill out a meeting agenda.
-   **Anything where you have to move information from one app to another.** Example: Adding tasks from a project management app into your personal to-do list app.
-   **Tasks that don't require much thinking.** Example: Copying the emails of event attendees to a spreadsheet.

## What is a Zap?

A Zap is an automated workflow that tells your apps to follow this simple command: "**When** this happens, **do** that."

Every Zap has a **trigger** and one or more **actions**. A trigger is an event that starts a Zap, and an action is what your Zap does for you. When a Zap runs, each action it completes counts as one task.

Think of these as building blocks for your Zap. Start with your trigger and add the action or actions you want Zapier to perform.
