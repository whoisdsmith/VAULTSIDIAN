# Quick Start | Dashy

---
Welcome to Dashy! So glad you're here ðŸ˜Š In a couple of minutes, you'll have your new dashboard up and running ðŸš€

**TDLR;** Run `docker run -p 8080:80 lissy93/dashy`, then open `http://localhost:8080`

___

## 1. Prerequisites[#](https://dashy.to/docs/#1-prerequisites "Direct link to heading")

The quickest and easiest method of running Dashy is using Docker (or another container engine). You can find installation instructions for your system in the [Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). If you don't want to use Docker, then you can use one of Dashy's other supported installation methods instead, all of which are outlined in the [Deployment Docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/deployment.md).

___

## 2. Installation[#](https://dashy.to/docs/#2-installation "Direct link to heading")

To pull the latest image, and build and start the app run:

```
docker run -d \  -p 8080:80 \  -v ~/my-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml \  --name my-dashboard \  --restart=always \  lissy93/dashy:latest
```

Either replace the -v path to point to your config file, or leave it out. For a full list of available options, then see [Dashy with Docker](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/deployment.md#deploy-with-docker) Docs. If you'd prefer to use Docker Compose, then see [Dashy with Docker Compose](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/deployment.md#using-docker-compose) Docs. Alternate registries, architectures and pinned versions are also supported.

Your dashboard should now be up and running at `http://localhost:8080` (or your servers IP address/ domain, and the port that you chose). The first time you build, it may take a few minutes.

## 3. Configure[#](https://dashy.to/docs/#3-configure "Direct link to heading")

Now that you've got Dashy running, you are going to want to set it up with your own content. Config is written in [YAML Format](https://yaml.org/), and saved in [`/public/conf.yml`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/public/conf.yml). The format on the config file is pretty straight forward. There are three root attributes:

-   [`pageInfo`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#pageinfo) - Dashboard meta data, like title, description, nav bar links and footer text
-   [`appConfig`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#appconfig-optional) - Dashboard settings, like themes, authentication, language and customization
-   [`sections`](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md#section) - An array of sections, each including an array of items

You can view a full list of all available config options in the [Configuring Docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/configuring.md).

```
pageInfo:  title: Home Labsections: # An array of sections- name: Example Section  icon: far fa-rocket  items:  - title: GitHub    description: Dashy source code and docs    icon: fab fa-github    url: https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy  - title: Issues    description: View open issues, or raise a new one    icon: fas fa-bug    url: https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/issues- name: Local Services  items:  - title: Firewall    icon: favicon    url: http://192.168.1.1/  - title: Game Server    icon: https://i.ibb.co/710B3Yc/space-invader-x256.png    url: http://192.168.130.1/
```

Notes:

-   You can use a Docker volume to pass a config file from your host system to the container
    -   E.g. `-v ./host-system/my-local-conf.yml:/app/public/conf.yml`
-   It's also possible to edit your config directly through the UI, and changes will be saved in this file
-   Check your config against Dashy's schema, with `docker exec -it [container-id] yarn validate-config`
-   You might find it helpful to look at some examples, a collection of which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/Lissy93/000f712a5ce98f212817d20bc16bab10)
-   After editing your config, the app will rebuild in the background, which may take a minute

## 4. Further Customisation[#](https://dashy.to/docs/#4-further-customisation "Direct link to heading")

Once you've got Dashy setup, you'll want to ensure the container is properly healthy, secured, backed up and kept up-to-date. All this is covered in the [Management Docs](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy/blob/master/docs/management.md).

## Alternative Deployment Method 1 - From Source[#](https://dashy.to/docs/#alternative-deployment-method-1---from-source "Direct link to heading")

You can also easily run the app on your system without Docker. For this [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are required.

```
git clone https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy.git && cd dashyyarn # Install dependenciesyarn build # Build the appyarn start # Start the app
```

Then edit `./public/conf.yml` and rebuild the app with `yarn build`
