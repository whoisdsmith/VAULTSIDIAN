## Creating Applets

The Applet creation tool is designed to help you build valuable Applets and publish them for the world to use. Your Applets can have multiple actions and [custom filter code](https://ifttt.com/docs/applets#using-filter-code) to go beyond the basic “if this, then that” paradigm. If there are terms below that you don't understand, check out the [glossary](https://ifttt.com/docs/glossary).

#### Some tips on using the tool

-   **Applet title:** Be specific. This is your chance to tell the user what they should expect this Applet to do for them — approach it like you would writing an instruction manual, instead of a catchy headline. Keep it short and to the point.
    
-   **Applet description:** This is where you can add in details about triggers and actions, and any information the user should customize, such as location or a hashtag.
    
-   **Trigger:** Select the trigger that you’d like to use for the Applet. The tool allows you to select from all services on IFTTT that have at least one trigger.
    
-   **Trigger fields:** The tool allows you to either hide or show trigger fields to the user when turning on the Applet. If the value for the field should be the same for all users, fill out the field and mark it as hidden. For example, if your Applet is “Tweet new technology articles from the New York Times”, you would select “Technology” for the NY Times “Section” trigger field and then hide it. If your Applet is “Tweet new articles from a section of the New York Times” you would mark the “Section” field to be chosen by the user.
    
-   **Queries:** Coming soon is the ability to query for information to be used as filtering conditions or to provide more data to be used in an action run.
    
-   **Filter:** You can write simple filter code which dictates which actions should run based on the trigger data coming in.
    
-   **Action(s):** You can select one or more actions to run when the trigger event occurs. Add additional actions by clicking the “Add action” button. Keep in mind that users must have activated all services used in the Applet in order to turn it on.
    
-   **Action fields:** Like trigger fields, data can be pre filled and hidden in an action field or can be filled out by the user. In the case of action fields, it is important to hide any fields that don’t need to be filled out by the user. For example, if your Applet is “Tweet your Instagram photos”, you would place the Instagram “SourceURL” ingredient in the Twitter “Image URL” action field and then hide it as this is the only appropriate ingredient to have in that field. You might ask the user to fill out other types of action fields themselves such as their location, their email address, or a name of a photo album private to them. Note that action fields marked to be “chosen by the user” can include prefilled text or numbers, but cannot include prefilled ingredients.
    

## Using filter code

When you build an Applet with the creation tool, you can use the **filter code** feature to add extra flexibility and power by writing your own JavaScript that runs whenever the Applet does. Your code has access to the data returned by the trigger, as well as metadata like the current time in the user's time zone, and it can use that information to override action field values or skip actions.

See the [Applets Cookbook](https://ifttt.com/docs/applets#applets-cookbook) section for some examples of what you can do with filter code.

There are some fields that are always available:

-   `Meta.currentUserTime`: The current time when your code is evaluated, in the user's timezone. This returns a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) object.
    
-   `Meta.triggerTime`: The time that the trigger event happened, in the user's timezone. This should be close to `currentUserTime`, but could vary depending on the polling period of the Applet's trigger. This returns a [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) object.
    

There are additional fields available depending on the specific trigger and actions that your Applet uses. For example, if your Applet uses the Weather Underground service's "Sunrise" trigger, your code can use `Weather.sunRises` to get the trigger's ingredients. If it uses the LIFX service's "Toggle lights on/off" action, your code can use `Lifx.toggle` to override that action's fields or skip it instead of running it.

The trigger's object contains the values of each of the trigger's ingredients. If you're using the "Sunrise" trigger, you can get the current temperature in Celsius by writing `Weather.sunRises.TempCelsius`. For convenience, you can also just write `Trigger.TempCelsius`, since an Applet can only have one trigger. Note that the ingredient values are always strings, even when they represent numeric data.

Each action's object has the following methods:

-   `skip()`: This lets you skip an action instead of running it. You can optionally provide a message that will be shown in the user's event feed to explain why the Applet decided not to run the action.
    
-   `set[FieldName]()`: For each hidden field of the action, you can use a correspondingly-named setter method to override its value. If you do, the value you provide will be used verbatim, skipping the templating step that normally happens with hidden fields. If you want to use ingredient values, you can do so by just using string concatenation or [JavaScript template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals):
    

```
Twitter.postNewTweet.setTweet(
  `The sun rose at ${Weather.sunRises.SunriseAt}`
)
```

When you override the value of a dropdown field, the argument you pass in should be the option's `value`, not its `label`. The filter code editor has autocomplete support for dropdown field setters to make this easier.

#### Technical details

-   When you write filter code, you're technically writing [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), not JavaScript. This helps prevent runtime problems with your code by catching simple mistakes as early as possible. You should generally be able to just write normal JavaScript, but the TypeScript documentation may be helpful if you run into issues with more advanced use cases.
    
-   Filter code is run in an isolated environment with a short timeout. There are no methods available that do any I/O (blocking or otherwise), so your code should execute quickly.
    

#### Testing and publishing your Applets

-   When your Applet has been all filled out, click the "Preview" button to create a private version of the Applet.
    
-   Visit your service page to try out the Applet to make sure that it is working as expected. Private Applets can be modified based on your testing.
    

## Applets Cookbook

In this section we provide a series of examples of Applets that take advantage of the Filter Code. It is important to note that JavaScript (Typescript) is a full-fledged programming language - if you need help you might consider participating in the Maker community on [Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/ifttt) or learning [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript).

## Troubleshooting Applets

Sometimes Applets run into issues or don't run as expected. Here are some tips for troubleshooting Applet issues that your users (or you!) may run into.

### Asking users for further information

Asking your users the following questions will help you further investigate the issue they are running into.

##### 1) What's your Applet version ID?

The _Applet version ID_ is an ID that specifies a user's version of an Applet. For example, [this Applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/YfkYtQB2-get-a-notification-when-the-international-space-station-passes-over-your-house)'s ID is `YfkYtQB2` but a user's specific _version_ of that Applet can be identified by an ID such as `78911786`.

This ID can be found on Applet's page when a specific user views it:

![Applet version ID](https://web-assets.ifttt.com/packs/media/docs/applet-version-id-on-applet-page-b45c57cb.png)

Once a user share's their Applet version ID with you, look up any relevant requests on [your service's Request Search page](https://ifttt.com/services/hello_world_086b07cf29/request_search) to find more information.

##### 2) Do you see any specific error messages?

Here's where they can look:

-   [Their IFTTT-wide account activity](https://ifttt.com/activity): ifttt.com/activity
-   A specific _Applet's_ activity: ifttt.com/activity/applet/**\[Applet-ID-here\]**
-   A specific _service's_ activity: ifttt.com/activity/service/**hello\_world\_086b07cf29**

##### 3) Did anything change recently about your Applet or the services involved?

This will be helpful in scenarios where a user's password changed, for example, or in scenarios where a user recently changed something about the specific Applet or the trigger/action services.

##### 4) What was the expected behavior of your Applet?

If they are concerned about the speed of their Applets, look into the [Realtime API](https://ifttt.com/docs/api_reference#realtime-api) if your service has triggers, and [your service's performance page](https://ifttt.com/services/hello_world_086b07cf29/performance) for further tips.

### Tools available to help troubleshoot

Once you have a user's report of an Applet issue, here are some tools to help you investigate:

-   [Request Search](https://ifttt.com/services/hello_world_086b07cf29/request_search): here you can look up specific requests based on request ID or Applet version ID to find more information on the request and response.
-   [Service Health](https://ifttt.com/services/hello_world_086b07cf29/health): here you can look for trends to see if this issue is new, if it is affecting many users or only a handful, etc.
-   Your server logs. With a request ID, you should be able to line up that request in your logs to see what might have gone wrong.
-   [The IFTTT.com _Applet Troubleshooting_ section](https://help.ifttt.com/hc/sections/115002772947-Troubleshooting-applets): our user support team has gathered great tips for users troubleshooting their Applets which could help you investigate as well.

### Understanding IFTTT error codes

Here is an explanation of the error codes that you might see on your [Service Health](https://ifttt.com/services/hello_world_086b07cf29/health) and [Request Search](https://ifttt.com/services/hello_world_086b07cf29/request_search) pages:

-   **E1**: error connecting to your service
-   **E2**: request timed out
-   **E3**: invalid JSON
-   **E4**: error from your service
-   **E5**: [action skipped](https://ifttt.com/docs/api_reference#skipping-actions)
-   **E7**: rate limit error from your service
-   **E0**: other uncaught error

In addition to those above, you may also see other [HTTP status codes](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html) and their corresponding descriptions.

Different types of requests can have individual thresholds for how long IFTTT waits for a response. The following timeouts are in place right now (subject to change without notice):

| Value (ms) | Endpoints |
| --- | --- |
| `2500` | /token endpoint when obtaining or refreshing a set of tokens |
| `8000` | Trigger, query and action API endpoints |
| `12000` | Connect API endpoints |

---
