## Getting started with Image

Image by Make lets you get information about a specific image (dimensions, type, and etc.), and directly change the size of the image.

## Possible problems

### Action terminated with an error

There are three cases when an action can terminate with an error:

1.  Received data was not in the JPG/GIF/PNG/BMP format
    
2.  The maximum width/height limit had been exceeded while changing the image dimensions. The image size must not exceed 3840 px width and 2160 px height
    
3.  The maximum allowable size of an image had been exceeded while changing the dimensions or format of the image. Learn [more about working with files](https://www.make.com/en/help/mapping/working-with-files.html "Working with files").
