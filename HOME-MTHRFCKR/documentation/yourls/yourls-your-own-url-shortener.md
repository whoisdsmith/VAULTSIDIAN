# YOURLS: Your Own URL Shortener

### What is YOURLS

**YOURLS** stands for **Your Own URL Shortener**. It is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (_a la_ TinyURL or Bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your data and don't depend on third-party services. It's also a great way to add branding to your short URLs, instead of using the same public URL shortener everyone uses.

### YOURLS Features

  * `Free` and `open-source` software,
  * `Private` (your links only) or `Public` (everybody can create short links, fine for an intranet),
  * Terrific `Plugin` architecture and dozens of `plugins` to easily implement new features,
  * Handy `bookmarklets` to easily shorten and share links,
  * Awesome `stats`: historical click reports, referrers tracking, visitors geo-location,
  * Developer `API` to integrate YOURLS into other applications,
  * Friendly `installer`,
  * `Sample files` to create your own public interface and more !
