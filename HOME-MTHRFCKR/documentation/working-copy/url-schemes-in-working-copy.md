- [URL schemes in Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/url-schemes.html#x-callback-url)
	- author: Anders Borum

---

You can open Working Copy and make it go to a specific screen with a URL: 
    
    
    working-copy://open?repo=my%20project&path=README.md&mode=content
    working-copy://open?repo=my%20project&commit=23f387&mode=status
    working-copy://open?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flibgit2%2Flibgit2&branch=develop
    working-copy://open?repo=my%20project&path=README.md&mode=preview
    
    
            
    
    Here _repo_ is either the name of a repository as seen in the list of repositories or
               the full remote URL. If you specify a _path_, Working Copy will show the
            given directory or file and if you specify a _commit_ hash (or prefix) you are shown the given commit.
                You can specify one of _path_, _commit_ or _branch_ but not more than one.
            
    
    
                You can control what to show such that _mode=content_ shows file content tab or directory
                contents for directories and repository; _mode=changes_ shows the Changes-tab and is only valid for
                files, _mode=status_ shows the Status-tab for files or Status screen for directories and
                repositories while _mode=preview_ shows the Content-tab in preview mode for files supporting
                this. You can omit the _mode_ parameter to leave mode unchanged.
    
    
            
    
    
                Jump to specific lines in the text file opened with the _line=123_ parameter and show
                messages with either _error=red%20%text_ or _message=blue%20text_
                to inform the user of something related to the file. If you include _line=_ but no
                _path=_ the app uses the path of current file. This can be used with
                [shortcuts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/43044ef544dd4e0db2886f6408fee047)
                activated through the share sheet that validate the current file.
            
    
    
            
    
    
                Make sure all parameters are URL-coded and that space is percent- rather than plus-encoded.
            
    
    
          
    
    
        
    
    ## Callback commands
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    To support workflows and automation, Working Copy has rich support for
            [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com/) commands.
    
    
            Because the commands allow reading and writing your sourcecode, they are protected by a _key_ parameter
            which must match a random alphanumeric code created when you first launch Working Copy on a new device. You can
            edit this key inside settings to get the same code for all your devices making it easier to reuse scripts, but you
            should make sure never to use a _key_ value you found in some public script, as this would be equivalent to
            sharing a password with everyone else. 
    
    
    
            
    
    The following commands are supported, where a ðŸ”’ indicates that the _push_ feature must
                be unlocked for that command to be available.
            
    
    * write files,
    
            
    * readðŸ”’ files,
    
            
    * move files,
    
            
    * archiveðŸ”’ multiple files,
    
            
    * commit changes,
    
            
    * list file status,
    
            
    * pushðŸ”’ to remote and
    
            
    * pull from remote.
    
            
    * fetch from remote.
    
            
    * checkout branch.
    
            
    * delete branch.
    
            
    * merge branches.
    
            
    * start or stop the WebDAV server.
    
            
    * list repositories
    
            
    * show commit log
    
            
    * list branches
    
            
    * init empty repository
    
            
    * clone repository from remote
    
            
    * run secure shell commands
    
            
    * chain multiple commands
    
            
    * Universal Link parameters
    
            
            
            You can also read a little about creating URL templates in Drafts
            and manually chaining together callbacks.
            
    
    
    
        
    
    ## URL format for x-callback-url
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    URLs for x-callback-url must have the form:
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/<command>/?x-success=<escaped-url>&repo=...&key=...
    
    
        
    
    If you include a _x-error_ parameter it will be used to deliver errors, otherwise errors are shown inside Working Copy.
        Including _x-success_ is also possible.
        
    
    
        
    
     ![Screenshot with URL callback settings including key.](img/callback-settings.png)
           
           
    
    To avoid very long examples the _key_ parameter will not be included in every example here,
            but it IS required for every x-callback-url command.
            In order to foil brute-force attempts at guessing the _key_, Working Copy
            will show errors related to _key_ inside the app, but will not be calling _x-error_.
           
    
    
        
    
    Most commands requires the _repo_ parameter that specifies which repository the command is about.
         This can either be the name of the repository as seen in the list of repositories in the outermost view of the app or the full
         remote url of the repository. Remember to url-encode _repo_ just like all other parameters. Space needs to be percent-
         rather than plus-encoded. If you specify _repo=$current_ the repository shown inside the app will
         be used.
    
    
        
    
    Many commands require the _path_ parameter which specifies the file or directory the command
          will act on. Paths are specified relative to the root of the repository where a empty _path_
          is the root directory and this the entire repository. Some commands will ask the user to pick
          a file or directory if no _path_ is specified and others will just use the root directory
          as its default. The details are documented in the section for each command. You can use _path=$current_
          to specify the currently shown path of a file or directory where the empty string will be substituted if
          you are not looking at any path.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Writing files
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    ![Screenshot showing README.md as only file in 'my repo'](img/my-repo.png)
        Write to existing or new files with the _write_ command. If you include a _text_ parameter this will
        be the content written to the file at the given _path_. The text parameter is transferred as UTF-8 but will
        be written in the encoding of the existing file or UTF-8 for new files. 
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?key=123ABC&repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&text=hello%20there
    
    
        
    
    If you need to write images or other binary files you can transfer the content as [base-64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
           by using the parameter _base64=_ instead of _text=_. You need to URL-encode after base-64
           encoding since the characters _+_ and _/_ occur after base-64 coding. This can also be handy
           if you want to overwrite the encoding of a existing file.
    
    
        
    
    If you do not include either a _text_ or _base64_ parameter the clipboard content is written
            or you can include _clipboard=1_ as a more direct way to write from the clipboard.
    
    
        
    
    If no _path_ parameter is specified the user will be asked to pick a file and if no _repo_
        is specified either the user will start out by picking a repository. In these situations you can suggest a filename
            with the _filename_ parameter and _uti_ to indicate the
            [Uniform Type Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier) such that the
        user can be warned before saving into a file where the name suggests a different type of data. If no
        _uti_ is specified the default is either "public.plain-text" or "public.item" depending on whether
         content is specified with _text_ or _base64_.
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?text=hello%20there&filename=test.txt&uti=public.text
    
    
    
        
    
    Working Copy supports exporting files with a filename with special information such that it can be identified
           as a specific file in a certain repository even though the original filename is used multiple times. To get
           this behaviour in _x-callback-url_ use the _write_ command with a _path_ but no
           _repo_ parameter. The path must be recognized for this to work or you will get a error that the
           file is not known.
    
    
        
    
    You can include _askcommit=1_ to be asked to commit and push the file after saving.
    
    
    
            
    
    You control how and when to write to the file with the _mode_ parameter.
                The default _mode=safe_ will create new files or overwrite non-modified files but refuse to
                write to files with uncommitted changes. When the user pick the file to write to you are allowed to
                overwrite files with uncommitted changes and you can force this behaviour with _mode=overwrite_.
                To combine new and old input you use _mode=append_ or _mode=prepend_.
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Reading filesðŸ”’
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    You can get the contents of text files with the _read_ command and result will be URL-encoded and appended to
                the x-success callback.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?repo=my%20repo&path=file&x-success=app%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Fread%3Ftext%3D
    
    
            
    
    will make Working Copy open a url on the form:
    
    
            
    
    
     app://x-callback-url/read?text=hello%20there
    
    
            
    
    You need to url encode _x-success_ and to support different apps that want to receive text differently and might not
                follow the x-callback-url conventions you should include the parameter name and then _=_ at the
                end of _x-success_. Working Copy tries to be smart about appending
                the file content as _&text=..._ if it detects a _x-callback-url_ that would become malformed,
                but your best bet is to format _x-success_ manually.
    
    
            
    
    If you are reading a binary file the result will be transferred as
                [base-64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) and if Working Copy appends the
                parameter name it will be _&base64=..._ but to ensure the file content is returned
                in base64 coding you include the input parameter _type=base64_.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?x-success=...&repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&base64=1 
    
    
            
    
    If no _path_ parameter is specified the user will be asked to pick a file and if no _repo_
                is specified either the user will start out by picking a repository. You can use _uti_ to
                specifify the kind of files you want. The user will be warned when picking a file that does not match
                the given [Uniform Type Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier). The
                default value for _uti_ is "public.plain-text" but this is changed to "public.item"
                if _base64_ indicates that you accept binary results.
    
    
            
    
    If you are asking the user to pick a file that will be used for a number of commands _type=url_
                can be used to get a universal url that can be passed to other
                x-callback-url commands.
    
    
            
    
    Include _clipboard=1_ to put the content of the file on the clipboard.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Moving files
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    To move or rename files within a repository you use the _move_ command. Both the _source_
                and _destination_ filenames are relative to the root of the repository.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/move/?repo=my%20repo&source=from.txt&destination=to.txt
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Archiving multiple filesðŸ”’
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    If you need to read multiple files you can use the _zip_ command that will return a base64-coded zip-archive
            of all the files in the directory specified by _path_. If you do not specify any _path_
            the entire repository is archived and if _path_ points to a single file, you will get a zip
            containing just this file.
    
    
            
    
    When you zip up entire repositories, the .git directory is not included unless
                _.git=1_ is passed along.
    
    
        
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/zip/?x-success=my-app://x-callback-url/read?path=/&repo=my%20repo 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Committing changes
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
          The _commit_ command can be used on single files, directories or the entire repository.
            You use the _path_
          parameter to specify the files to take into account, where a missing or empty parameter means the entire repository is
          checked for modified files to commit. 
    
    
          
    
    To avoid accidentally committing unexpected changes the _limit_ parameter is
          checked and if there are more changed files covered by _path_ than allowed by _limit_ the commit fails.
          The default is _limit=1_ but you can set it to large values if you intentionally want to commit
          all changed files.
    
    
          
    
    You can supply a _message_ parameter for the commit message and formatting/wrapping
          this _message_ in accordance with [best practices](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#_commit_guidelines)
          is your responsibility. 
    
    
          
    
    If no _message_ is supplied a dialog is shown to commit the given files. Since this
             requires user interaction it's allowed without the callback _key_.
    
    
    
          
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/commit/?repo=my%20repo&path=&limit=999&message=fix 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Listing file status
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
            If you need to determine the status of the repository, the files that are modified or even all the
            files it contains, you can use the _status_ command. It takes a _path_ parameter and has the same
            default value and interpretation as for the [commit](committing) command. Normally you will only
            get the status for files that have changed since the last commit, but this behaviour can be changed by
            adding the parameter _unchanged=1_. 
    
    
            
    
    If path points to a directory you will get the status for all files in the directory and for sub-directories
            as well. To limit this, you can specify a maximum depth, where _depth=1_ will include the contents
            of the immediate sub-directories of _path_ but no deeper.
            
    
    
       
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/status/?repo=my%20repo&unchanged=1
    
    
        
    
    
    [{"name": "README.md", "path": "README.md", "status": "modified", "kind": "Markdown", "size": 355},
     {"name": "src", "path": "src", "status": "unchanged", "kind": "directory"},
     {"name": "main.c", "path": "src/main.c", "status": "unchanged", "kind": "C source", "size": 4510}
     â€¦â€¦
    ]
    
    
        
    
    The results are delivered as JSON and note the difference between _path_ which is relative
        to the root of the repository and _name_ that is just the filename.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Push to remoteðŸ”’
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    Use the _push_ command to send commits back to the origin remote. If you need to authenticate, the
        push command will wait until you have entered your credentials. 
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/push/?repo=my%20repo 
    
    
        
    
    You can push to other remotes than origin by using the _remote_ parameter.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/push/?repo=my%20repo&remote=heroku 
    
    
        
    
    You can push all repositories remotes by using wildcards on the form _repo=*_ where the asterix matches
            one or more characters, but these wildcards are only resolved against name, not remote URLs.
            As with other special characters _*_ needs to be URL-encoded as _%2A_.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/push/?repo=%2A 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Pull from remote
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    The _pull_ command fetches and merges changes from your origin remote. If you need to authenticate, the
         pull command will wait until you have entered your credentials. Any merge conflicts will count as a error.
    
    
          
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/pull/?repo=my%20repo
    
    
         
    
    Just like the _push_ command you can use the _remote_ parameter to pull from
          non-origin remotes and _repo_ parameter can contain wildcards.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Fetch from remote
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    The _fetch_ command fetches from your origin remote and if you need to authenticate, the
                command will wait until you have entered your credentials. 
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/fetch/?repo=my%20repo
    
    
            
    
    Just like the _pull_ command you can use the _remote_ parameter to fetch from
                non-origin remotes and _repo_ parameter can contain wildcards.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Checkout branch
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Default behaviour is to switch to a existing branch which requires that there are no current modifications.
                You can specify _branch=$current_ to checkout the branch currently being shown in the app,
                which is not the same thing as the current branch for the repository, which there is no need to checkout.
               To create a new branch during checkout use _mode=create_ or _mode=ensure_ to only
               create the branch when missing.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/checkout?repo=my%20repo&branch=develop
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Delete branch
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Delete a branch if all commits are available in other branches. Set _mode_ to
                _force_, _refuse_ or the default _prompt_ to control behaviour when
                commits would be lost. 
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/delete?repo=my%20repo&branch=develop&mode=refuse
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Merge branches
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use this command to merge branches programmatically. 
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/merge?repo=my%20repo&branch=develop
    
    
            
    
    The _branch_ parameter names the branch that will be merged on
              the current branch, but to merge the remote counterpart of the current branch
                you leave the _branch_ parameter missing or empty.
                You can specify a particular remote for the _branch_
                with the _remote_ parameter using either a remote name or URL.
                This remote will be fetched before merge to make sure the remote branch is up-to-date
                and if you specify _create=1_ the remote will even be created if missing.
              
    
    
            
    
    If there are any conflicts the user will be asked to fix these interactively
            followed up by a commit to finish the merge. You can disable this with the
            parameter _resolve=0_ and merge conflicts will count as error.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Control WebDAV Server
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    Use the _webdav_ command to start or stop the
            [internal WebDAV server](manual.html#webdav-server). The _cmd_ parameter
        can be either _start_ or _stop_ where the default is _cmd=start_.
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/webdav/?cmd=start
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## List repositories
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _repos_ command to get information about name, status, current branch and remotes for
                all repositories inside Working Copy in JSON format. 
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/repos
    
    
        
    
    
    [{"name":"welcome to working copy", "branch":"master", "head":"d39002aâ€¦",
      "status":"tap to learn more", "remotes":[]},
     {"name":"libgit2", "branch":"master", "head":"e70d822â€¦", "status":"nothing to commit",
      "remotes":
       [{"name":"origin", "fetch":1,"push":1,"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/libgit2\/libgit2.git"}]}
    ]
    
    
            
    
    It can get a little complicated to work with this JSON, but
                [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&at=1000lHq)
                users can try this small
                [workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/a7fb61375f474925a1c047c7e28b3017) that
                asks the user to pick one of the available repositories and could be used as a component for something
                bigger. You will need to insert your URL key in the first action.
            
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Commit Log
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    You can read a list of commits with the _log_ command. You need to specify a _repo_
                and will get the newest 10 commits in JSON format, unless _limit_ parameter overrides this.
                To only get commits relevant for particular files or diretories, use the _path_ parameter
                or use _branch_ to only get commits for that particular branch.

    ## List branches
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _branches_ command to enquire about all local and remote
                branches in a repository.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/branches?repo=my%20repo

      ...]
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Init empty repository
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _init_ command to create a new repository without any files or remotes,
                where _name_ parameter must not be used by any other repository.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/init/?name=new%20repository
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Clone repository
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _clone_ command clone repository with _remote_
                parameter. Result of callback will be the name of the repository
                inside Working Copy.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/clone/?remote=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flibgit2%2Flibgit2
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Run secure shell command
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use this command to automate the [SSH Command](/manual/ssh-command) feature.
               Remember that this will upload your local repository before running the _cmd_
               and download files that change while the command is running. If you just want to run
               a command on a remote server there are perhaps other apps better suited for this.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/ssh-command/?server=remote.server.net&cmd=run%20tests
    
    
            
    
    You can specify _source=subdir_ and _remote=dir_ to specify the local and remote
               directories to keep upload to and download from. The default for _source_ is the repository root
               and the default for _remote_ is the remote home directory.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Chain multiple commands
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    Sometimes you want to run several x-callback-url commands in Working Copy and this becomes
            very convoluted with multiple levels of encoding. You would need to start with the last command and work
            your way to the first building a larger and larger _x-success_ chain.
    
    
            
    
    To achieve the same result, use the _chain_ command.
    
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/chain?repo=my%20repo&command=commit&message=fix&command=push
    working-copy://x-callback-url/chain?repo=%2A&command=pull&command=push
    
    
    
            
    
    You use the _command_ parameter once for each command. The parameters before the first _command_
            parameter is shared by all commands, and parameters meant for a single command is specified after the _command_
            it applies to but before the next one. Often parameters _key_, _repo_ and _x-error_ are shared.
    
    
        
    
    
            You can specify _x-success_ as a shared parameter, but it will only be used
            for the last command since the earlier commands are bound by the command chain.
        
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Universal Link parameters
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Inside Working Copy you can create Universal Links that describe repositories or
            files, branches or commits inside repositories with the Share Sheet. 
    
    
            [
                
    
    
    https://workingcopyapp.com/git/#repo=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&path=README.md
    
    ](https://workingcopyapp.com/git/#repo=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&path=README.md)
                
    
    Their primary purpose is to make it easy to
            jump to specific content in Working Copy, but they also serve a purpose as x-callback-url
            parameters. You can include a Universal Link in the _url_ parameter and all the inner
                parameters will be extracted and used making the following two commands equivalent:
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkingcopyapp.com%2Fgit%2F%23repo%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftwbs%2Fbootstrap%26path%3DREADME.md
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read?repo=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&path=README.md
            
    
    
            
    
    This is useful when you start a Workflow from within Working Copy, as you can specify
               the file, directory or repository to act on and send this along as a single parameter.
            
    
    
            
    
    Use x-callback-url/read with _type=url_ to get back the
                universal url of a file picked by the user.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Drafts Templates
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    
                ![](img/drafts-example.png)
            
    
    
           
    
    
            If you are using
            [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lHq)
            by [Agile Tortoise](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/),
               there are some tricks that make it much easier to make
               [URL templates](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202843484-Templates-and-Tags).
               First line in a draft can be referenced as _[[title]]_ and the remainder as _[[body]]_.
           
    
    
            
    
    
                Often you want to send a draft into Working Copy. You need to use the
                write command, specifying filename (path), repository (repo),
                access key (key), content (text) and perhaps you want to jump back to Drafts when done (x-success={{drafts://}}).
            
    
    
            
    
    Imagine that you need to create a new Jekyll post
            from a draft. The date determines the filename and the content is a combination of YAML front matter
            and content. Note how _%0a_ is encoded manually to have newline in the front matter.
    
    
            
    
    For more complicated actions it is probably a good idea to use javascript to compose the URL
            with the [Script](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202771590-Action-Step-Script)
                action step using the clipboard as temporary storage.
            
    
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?repo={{jekyll-site}}&path={{posts/}}[[date]].md&text=---%0a{{layout: post}}%0a{{title: }}[[title]]%0a---%0a[[body]]&key={{12345678}}
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Manually chaining callbacks
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ![Link is clicked that opens Working Copy and then sends file contents into Textastic to create new file.](img/textastic-new.gif)
            URL callbacks can get pretty complicated when you want to send the result of one callback along to
           another URL callback. 
    
    
        
        
    
    
            To create a new text file in [Textastic](http://www.textasticapp.com/v4/manual/x-callback-url.html)
            with the filename "two words.txt" you would use the following URL:
    
    
        
    
    
    textastic://x-callback-url/new?name=two%20words.txt&text=hello%20there
    
    
        
    
    
         If you wanted to create this file with content from the file _README.md_ in the repository _my repo_
         you would need to URL escape the callback to Textastic which gives rise to double-encoding of parameters passed
         along.  
     _space â†’ %20 â†’ %2520_
    
    
         
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&x-success=textastic%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Fnew%3Fname%3Dtwo%2520words.txt%26text%3D
    
    
    
        
    
    You could also start a new email with the contents of this file, by making _x-success_
           use the _mailto:_ scheme with something like
           
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&x-success=mailto%3A%3Fbody%3D
    
    
           
    
    If you need to debug your callbacks, setting _x-success=mailto%3A%3Fbody%3D_
           can be very helpful.
    
    
         
    
    
        
    
    
    




# URL schemes in Working Copy

# Controlling Working Copy with URL schemes

To allow integration with other applications and automated workflows [Working Copy](/) can be opened with special URL schemes and controlled with x-callback-url. Commands that change data or read content out of Working Copy is protected by a secret key. 

## Opening Working Copy at specific screens

You can open Working Copy and make it go to a specific screen with a URL: 
    
    
    working-copy://open?repo=my%20project&path=README.md&mode=content
    working-copy://open?repo=my%20project&commit=23f387&mode=status
    working-copy://open?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flibgit2%2Flibgit2&branch=develop
    working-copy://open?repo=my%20project&path=README.md&mode=preview
    
    
            
    
    Here _repo_ is either the name of a repository as seen in the list of repositories or
               the full remote URL. If you specify a _path_, Working Copy will show the
            given directory or file and if you specify a _commit_ hash (or prefix) you are shown the given commit.
                You can specify one of _path_, _commit_ or _branch_ but not more than one.
            
    
    
                You can control what to show such that _mode=content_ shows file content tab or directory
                contents for directories and repository; _mode=changes_ shows the Changes-tab and is only valid for
                files, _mode=status_ shows the Status-tab for files or Status screen for directories and
                repositories while _mode=preview_ shows the Content-tab in preview mode for files supporting
                this. You can omit the _mode_ parameter to leave mode unchanged.
    
    
            
    
    
                Jump to specific lines in the text file opened with the _line=123_ parameter and show
                messages with either _error=red%20%text_ or _message=blue%20text_
                to inform the user of something related to the file. If you include _line=_ but no
                _path=_ the app uses the path of current file. This can be used with

                Make sure all parameters are URL-coded and that space is percent- rather than plus-encoded.
            
    
    
          
    
    
    
            
    
    ## Initiate cloning
    
    
         
    
    
    
            
    
    You can ask Working Copy to open the clone-dialog with a specific URL awaiting the users
                confirmation:
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://clone?remote=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgit%2Fgit.git
    
    
             
    
    
    
            
    
    ## Show remote, cloning as needed
    
    
            
    
    
            
    
    If you need to make a link that shows a given remote repository inside [Working Copy](/),
                without knowing whether the user has a existing clone,
                use the _show_ command that will open the repository if one exists with that remote
                and otherwise initiate cloning.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://show?remote=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgit%2Fgit.git
    
    
           
    
    
    
            
    
    ## Import logs
    
    
            
    
    
                
    
    The app supports using [log files](manual.html#logfiles) in the
                    context of the repository contents and it can be useful to import and show these with a URL:
                
    
    
                
    
    
    working-copy://import-log?lines=first%20line%0Asecond%20line
    
    
                
    
    The _lines_ parameter is mandatory and you can use _repo_
                to specify either a repository name or remote url the log refers to, _timestamp_ to
                indicate the time the log was recorded as
                [unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time)
                and _kind_ to one of _import_,
                    [bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/),
                    [circleci](https://circleci.com/),
                    [jenkins](https://jenkins.io),
                    [buddy](https://www.buddybuild.com),
                    _fetch_, _push_, _pull_, _clone_
                    where _kind=import_ is the default.
                
    
    
            
    
    
        
    
    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Callback commands
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    To support workflows and automation, Working Copy has rich support for
            [x-callback-url](http://x-callback-url.com/) commands.
    
    
            Because the commands allow reading and writing your sourcecode, they are protected by a _key_ parameter
            which must match a random alphanumeric code created when you first launch Working Copy on a new device. You can
            edit this key inside settings to get the same code for all your devices making it easier to reuse scripts, but you
            should make sure never to use a _key_ value you found in some public script, as this would be equivalent to
            sharing a password with everyone else. 
    
    
    
            
    
    The following commands are supported, where a ðŸ”’ indicates that the _push_ feature must
                be unlocked for that command to be available.
            
    
    * write files,
    
            
    * readðŸ”’ files,
    
            
    * move files,
    
            
    * archiveðŸ”’ multiple files,
    
            
    * commit changes,
    
            
    * list file status,
    
            
    * pushðŸ”’ to remote and
    
            
    * pull from remote.
    
            
    * fetch from remote.
    
            
    * checkout branch.
    
            
    * delete branch.
    
            
    * merge branches.
    
            
    * start or stop the WebDAV server.
    
            
    * list repositories
    
            
    * show commit log
    
            
    * list branches
    
            
    * init empty repository
    
            
    * clone repository from remote
    
            
    * run secure shell commands
    
            
    * chain multiple commands
    
            
    * Universal Link parameters
    
            
            
    
    
            You can also read a little about creating URL templates in Drafts
            and manually chaining together callbacks.
            
    
    
    
        
    
    ## URL format for x-callback-url
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    URLs for x-callback-url must have the form:
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/<command>/?x-success=<escaped-url>&repo=...&key=...
    
    
        
    
    If you include a _x-error_ parameter it will be used to deliver errors, otherwise errors are shown inside Working Copy.
        Including _x-success_ is also possible.
        
    
    
        
    
     ![Screenshot with URL callback settings including key.](img/callback-settings.png)
           
           
    
    To avoid very long examples the _key_ parameter will not be included in every example here,
            but it IS required for every x-callback-url command.
            In order to foil brute-force attempts at guessing the _key_, Working Copy
            will show errors related to _key_ inside the app, but will not be calling _x-error_.
           
    
    
        
    
    Most commands requires the _repo_ parameter that specifies which repository the command is about.
         This can either be the name of the repository as seen in the list of repositories in the outermost view of the app or the full
         remote url of the repository. Remember to url-encode _repo_ just like all other parameters. Space needs to be percent-
         rather than plus-encoded. If you specify _repo=$current_ the repository shown inside the app will
         be used.
    
    
        
    
    Many commands require the _path_ parameter which specifies the file or directory the command
          will act on. Paths are specified relative to the root of the repository where a empty _path_
          is the root directory and this the entire repository. Some commands will ask the user to pick
          a file or directory if no _path_ is specified and others will just use the root directory
          as its default. The details are documented in the section for each command. You can use _path=$current_
          to specify the currently shown path of a file or directory where the empty string will be substituted if
          you are not looking at any path.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Writing files
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    ![Screenshot showing README.md as only file in 'my repo'](img/my-repo.png)
        Write to existing or new files with the _write_ command. If you include a _text_ parameter this will
        be the content written to the file at the given _path_. The text parameter is transferred as UTF-8 but will
        be written in the encoding of the existing file or UTF-8 for new files. 
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?key=123ABC&repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&text=hello%20there
    
    
        
    
    If you need to write images or other binary files you can transfer the content as [base-64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
           by using the parameter _base64=_ instead of _text=_. You need to URL-encode after base-64
           encoding since the characters _+_ and _/_ occur after base-64 coding. This can also be handy
           if you want to overwrite the encoding of a existing file.
    
    
        
    
    If you do not include either a _text_ or _base64_ parameter the clipboard content is written
            or you can include _clipboard=1_ as a more direct way to write from the clipboard.
    
    
        
    
    If no _path_ parameter is specified the user will be asked to pick a file and if no _repo_
        is specified either the user will start out by picking a repository. In these situations you can suggest a filename
            with the _filename_ parameter and _uti_ to indicate the
            [Uniform Type Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier) such that the
        user can be warned before saving into a file where the name suggests a different type of data. If no
        _uti_ is specified the default is either "public.plain-text" or "public.item" depending on whether
         content is specified with _text_ or _base64_.
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?text=hello%20there&filename=test.txt&uti=public.text
    
    
    
        
    
    Working Copy supports exporting files with a filename with special information such that it can be identified
           as a specific file in a certain repository even though the original filename is used multiple times. To get
           this behaviour in _x-callback-url_ use the _write_ command with a _path_ but no
           _repo_ parameter. The path must be recognized for this to work or you will get a error that the
           file is not known.
    
    
        
    
    You can include _askcommit=1_ to be asked to commit and push the file after saving.
    
    
    
            
    
    You control how and when to write to the file with the _mode_ parameter.
                The default _mode=safe_ will create new files or overwrite non-modified files but refuse to
                write to files with uncommitted changes. When the user pick the file to write to you are allowed to
                overwrite files with uncommitted changes and you can force this behaviour with _mode=overwrite_.
                To combine new and old input you use _mode=append_ or _mode=prepend_.
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Reading filesðŸ”’
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    You can get the contents of text files with the _read_ command and result will be URL-encoded and appended to
                the x-success callback.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?repo=my%20repo&path=file&x-success=app%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Fread%3Ftext%3D
    
    
            
    
    will make Working Copy open a url on the form:
    
    
            
    
    
     app://x-callback-url/read?text=hello%20there
    
    
            
    
    You need to url encode _x-success_ and to support different apps that want to receive text differently and might not
                follow the x-callback-url conventions you should include the parameter name and then _=_ at the
                end of _x-success_. Working Copy tries to be smart about appending
                the file content as _&text=..._ if it detects a _x-callback-url_ that would become malformed,
                but your best bet is to format _x-success_ manually.
    
    
            
    
    If you are reading a binary file the result will be transferred as
                [base-64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) and if Working Copy appends the
                parameter name it will be _&base64=..._ but to ensure the file content is returned
                in base64 coding you include the input parameter _type=base64_.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?x-success=...&repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&base64=1 
    
    
            
    
    If no _path_ parameter is specified the user will be asked to pick a file and if no _repo_
                is specified either the user will start out by picking a repository. You can use _uti_ to
                specifify the kind of files you want. The user will be warned when picking a file that does not match
                the given [Uniform Type Identifier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Type_Identifier). The
                default value for _uti_ is "public.plain-text" but this is changed to "public.item"
                if _base64_ indicates that you accept binary results.
    
    
            
    
    If you are asking the user to pick a file that will be used for a number of commands _type=url_
                can be used to get a universal url that can be passed to other
                x-callback-url commands.
    
    
            
    
    Include _clipboard=1_ to put the content of the file on the clipboard.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Moving files
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    To move or rename files within a repository you use the _move_ command. Both the _source_
                and _destination_ filenames are relative to the root of the repository.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/move/?repo=my%20repo&source=from.txt&destination=to.txt
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Archiving multiple filesðŸ”’
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    If you need to read multiple files you can use the _zip_ command that will return a base64-coded zip-archive
            of all the files in the directory specified by _path_. If you do not specify any _path_
            the entire repository is archived and if _path_ points to a single file, you will get a zip
            containing just this file.
    
    
            
    
    When you zip up entire repositories, the .git directory is not included unless
                _.git=1_ is passed along.
    
    
        
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/zip/?x-success=my-app://x-callback-url/read?path=/&repo=my%20repo 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Committing changes
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
          The _commit_ command can be used on single files, directories or the entire repository.
            You use the _path_
          parameter to specify the files to take into account, where a missing or empty parameter means the entire repository is
          checked for modified files to commit. 
    
    
          
    
    To avoid accidentally committing unexpected changes the _limit_ parameter is
          checked and if there are more changed files covered by _path_ than allowed by _limit_ the commit fails.
          The default is _limit=1_ but you can set it to large values if you intentionally want to commit
          all changed files.
    
    
          
    
    You can supply a _message_ parameter for the commit message and formatting/wrapping
          this _message_ in accordance with [best practices](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#_commit_guidelines)
          is your responsibility. 
    
    
          
    
    If no _message_ is supplied a dialog is shown to commit the given files. Since this
             requires user interaction it's allowed without the callback _key_.
    
    
    
          
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/commit/?repo=my%20repo&path=&limit=999&message=fix 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Listing file status
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    
            If you need to determine the status of the repository, the files that are modified or even all the
            files it contains, you can use the _status_ command. It takes a _path_ parameter and has the same
            default value and interpretation as for the [commit](committing) command. Normally you will only
            get the status for files that have changed since the last commit, but this behaviour can be changed by
            adding the parameter _unchanged=1_. 
    
    
            
    
    If path points to a directory you will get the status for all files in the directory and for sub-directories
            as well. To limit this, you can specify a maximum depth, where _depth=1_ will include the contents
            of the immediate sub-directories of _path_ but no deeper.
            
    
    
       
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/status/?repo=my%20repo&unchanged=1
    
    
        
    
    
    [{"name": "README.md", "path": "README.md", "status": "modified", "kind": "Markdown", "size": 355},
     {"name": "src", "path": "src", "status": "unchanged", "kind": "directory"},
     {"name": "main.c", "path": "src/main.c", "status": "unchanged", "kind": "C source", "size": 4510}
     â€¦â€¦
    ]
    
    
        
    
    The results are delivered as JSON and note the difference between _path_ which is relative
        to the root of the repository and _name_ that is just the filename.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Push to remoteðŸ”’
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    Use the _push_ command to send commits back to the origin remote. If you need to authenticate, the
        push command will wait until you have entered your credentials. 
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/push/?repo=my%20repo 
    
    
        
    
    You can push to other remotes than origin by using the _remote_ parameter.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/push/?repo=my%20repo&remote=heroku 
    
    
        
    
    You can push all repositories remotes by using wildcards on the form _repo=*_ where the asterix matches
            one or more characters, but these wildcards are only resolved against name, not remote URLs.
            As with other special characters _*_ needs to be URL-encoded as _%2A_.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/push/?repo=%2A 
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Pull from remote
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    The _pull_ command fetches and merges changes from your origin remote. If you need to authenticate, the
         pull command will wait until you have entered your credentials. Any merge conflicts will count as a error.
    
    
          
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/pull/?repo=my%20repo
    
    
         
    
    Just like the _push_ command you can use the _remote_ parameter to pull from
          non-origin remotes and _repo_ parameter can contain wildcards.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Fetch from remote
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    The _fetch_ command fetches from your origin remote and if you need to authenticate, the
                command will wait until you have entered your credentials. 
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/fetch/?repo=my%20repo
    
    
            
    
    Just like the _pull_ command you can use the _remote_ parameter to fetch from
                non-origin remotes and _repo_ parameter can contain wildcards.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Checkout branch
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Default behaviour is to switch to a existing branch which requires that there are no current modifications.
                You can specify _branch=$current_ to checkout the branch currently being shown in the app,
                which is not the same thing as the current branch for the repository, which there is no need to checkout.
               To create a new branch during checkout use _mode=create_ or _mode=ensure_ to only
               create the branch when missing.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/checkout?repo=my%20repo&branch=develop
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Delete branch
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Delete a branch if all commits are available in other branches. Set _mode_ to
                _force_, _refuse_ or the default _prompt_ to control behaviour when
                commits would be lost. 
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/delete?repo=my%20repo&branch=develop&mode=refuse
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Merge branches
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use this command to merge branches programmatically. 
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/merge?repo=my%20repo&branch=develop
    
    
            
    
    The _branch_ parameter names the branch that will be merged on
              the current branch, but to merge the remote counterpart of the current branch
                you leave the _branch_ parameter missing or empty.
                You can specify a particular remote for the _branch_
                with the _remote_ parameter using either a remote name or URL.
                This remote will be fetched before merge to make sure the remote branch is up-to-date
                and if you specify _create=1_ the remote will even be created if missing.
              
    
    
            
    
    If there are any conflicts the user will be asked to fix these interactively
            followed up by a commit to finish the merge. You can disable this with the
            parameter _resolve=0_ and merge conflicts will count as error.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Control WebDAV Server
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    Use the _webdav_ command to start or stop the
            [internal WebDAV server](manual.html#webdav-server). The _cmd_ parameter
        can be either _start_ or _stop_ where the default is _cmd=start_.
    
    
        
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/webdav/?cmd=start
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## List repositories
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _repos_ command to get information about name, status, current branch and remotes for
                all repositories inside Working Copy in JSON format. 
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/repos
    
    
        
    
    
    [{"name":"welcome to working copy", "branch":"master", "head":"d39002aâ€¦",
      "status":"tap to learn more", "remotes":[]},
     {"name":"libgit2", "branch":"master", "head":"e70d822â€¦", "status":"nothing to commit",
      "remotes":
       [{"name":"origin", "fetch":1,"push":1,"url":"https:\/\/github.com\/libgit2\/libgit2.git"}]}
    ]
    
    
            
    
    It can get a little complicated to work with this JSON, but
                [Workflow](https://itunes.apple.com/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&at=1000lHq)
                users can try this small
                [workflow](https://workflow.is/workflows/a7fb61375f474925a1c047c7e28b3017) that
                asks the user to pick one of the available repositories and could be used as a component for something
                bigger. You will need to insert your URL key in the first action.
            
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Commit Log
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    You can read a list of commits with the _log_ command. You need to specify a _repo_
                and will get the newest 10 commits in JSON format, unless _limit_ parameter overrides this.
                To only get commits relevant for particular files or diretories, use the _path_ parameter
                or use _branch_ to only get commits for that particular branch.

    ## List branches
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _branches_ command to enquire about all local and remote
                branches in a repository.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/branches?repo=my%20repo

      ...]
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Init empty repository
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _init_ command to create a new repository without any files or remotes,
                where _name_ parameter must not be used by any other repository.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/init/?name=new%20repository
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Clone repository
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use the _clone_ command clone repository with _remote_
                parameter. Result of callback will be the name of the repository
                inside Working Copy.
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/clone/?remote=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Flibgit2%2Flibgit2
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Run secure shell command
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Use this command to automate the [SSH Command](/manual/ssh-command) feature.
               Remember that this will upload your local repository before running the _cmd_
               and download files that change while the command is running. If you just want to run
               a command on a remote server there are perhaps other apps better suited for this.
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/ssh-command/?server=remote.server.net&cmd=run%20tests
    
    
            
    
    You can specify _source=subdir_ and _remote=dir_ to specify the local and remote
               directories to keep upload to and download from. The default for _source_ is the repository root
               and the default for _remote_ is the remote home directory.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Chain multiple commands
    
    
        
    
    
        
    
    Sometimes you want to run several x-callback-url commands in Working Copy and this becomes
            very convoluted with multiple levels of encoding. You would need to start with the last command and work
            your way to the first building a larger and larger _x-success_ chain.
    
    
            
    
    To achieve the same result, use the _chain_ command.
    
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/chain?repo=my%20repo&command=commit&message=fix&command=push
    working-copy://x-callback-url/chain?repo=%2A&command=pull&command=push
    
    
    
            
    
    You use the _command_ parameter once for each command. The parameters before the first _command_
            parameter is shared by all commands, and parameters meant for a single command is specified after the _command_
            it applies to but before the next one. Often parameters _key_, _repo_ and _x-error_ are shared.
    
    
        
    
    
            You can specify _x-success_ as a shared parameter, but it will only be used
            for the last command since the earlier commands are bound by the command chain.
        
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Universal Link parameters
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    Inside Working Copy you can create Universal Links that describe repositories or
            files, branches or commits inside repositories with the Share Sheet. 
    
    
            [
                
    
    
    https://workingcopyapp.com/git/#repo=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&path=README.md
    
    ](https://workingcopyapp.com/git/#repo=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&path=README.md)
                
    
    Their primary purpose is to make it easy to
            jump to specific content in Working Copy, but they also serve a purpose as x-callback-url
            parameters. You can include a Universal Link in the _url_ parameter and all the inner
                parameters will be extracted and used making the following two commands equivalent:
    
    
            
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read?url=https%3A%2F%2Fworkingcopyapp.com%2Fgit%2F%23repo%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ftwbs%2Fbootstrap%26path%3DREADME.md
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read?repo=https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap&path=README.md
            
    
    
            
    
    This is useful when you start a Workflow from within Working Copy, as you can specify
               the file, directory or repository to act on and send this along as a single parameter.
            
    
    
            
    
    Use x-callback-url/read with _type=url_ to get back the
                universal url of a file picked by the user.
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Drafts Templates
    
    
        
    
    
            
    
    
                ![](img/drafts-example.png)
    
    ![](video/play.png)
    
    
            
    
    
           
    
    
            If you are using
            [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id905337691?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000lHq)
            by [Agile Tortoise](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/),
               there are some tricks that make it much easier to make
               [URL templates](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202843484-Templates-and-Tags).
               First line in a draft can be referenced as _[[title]]_ and the remainder as _[[body]]_.
           
    
    
            
    
    
                Often you want to send a draft into Working Copy. You need to use the
                write command, specifying filename (path), repository (repo),
                access key (key), content (text) and perhaps you want to jump back to Drafts when done (x-success={{drafts://}}).
            
    
    
            
    
    Imagine that you need to create a new Jekyll post
            from a draft. The date determines the filename and the content is a combination of YAML front matter
            and content. Note how _%0a_ is encoded manually to have newline in the front matter.
    
    
            
    
    For more complicated actions it is probably a good idea to use javascript to compose the URL
            with the [Script](https://agiletortoise.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202771590-Action-Step-Script)
                action step using the clipboard as temporary storage.
            
    
    
    
            
    
    
     working-copy://x-callback-url/write/?repo={{jekyll-site}}&path={{posts/}}[[date]].md&text=---%0a{{layout: post}}%0a{{title: }}[[title]]%0a---%0a[[body]]&key={{12345678}}
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ## Manually chaining callbacks
    
    
        
    
    
    
        
    
    ![Link is clicked that opens Working Copy and then sends file contents into Textastic to create new file.](img/textastic-new.gif)
            URL callbacks can get pretty complicated when you want to send the result of one callback along to
           another URL callback. 
    
    
        
        
    
    
            To create a new text file in [Textastic](http://www.textasticapp.com/v4/manual/x-callback-url.html)
            with the filename "two words.txt" you would use the following URL:
    
    
        
    
    
    textastic://x-callback-url/new?name=two%20words.txt&text=hello%20there
    
    
        
    
    
         If you wanted to create this file with content from the file _README.md_ in the repository _my repo_
         you would need to URL escape the callback to Textastic which gives rise to double-encoding of parameters passed
         along.  
     _space â†’ %20 â†’ %2520_
    
    
         
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&x-success=textastic%3A%2F%2Fx-callback-url%2Fnew%3Fname%3Dtwo%2520words.txt%26text%3D
    
    
    
        
    
    You could also start a new email with the contents of this file, by making _x-success_
           use the _mailto:_ scheme with something like
           
    
    
    working-copy://x-callback-url/read/?repo=my%20repo&path=README.md&x-success=mailto%3A%3Fbody%3D
    
    
           
    
    If you need to debug your callbacks, setting _x-success=mailto%3A%3Fbody%3D_
           can be very helpful.
    
    
         
    
    
        
    
    
      
    
    
    
    
    
     
    
    
    
        Read the [manual](/manual.html) or the [newsletter](/newsletter/) and get
        in touch by [email](mailto:anders@workingcopyapp.com) or
        on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/workingcopyapp).
