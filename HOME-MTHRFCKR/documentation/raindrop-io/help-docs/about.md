# About

import Header from './header.svg';

In our fast-moving world, bookmarks bar is no longer the best place for ideas, inspiration and knowledge. Your browser doesn’t give you tools to organize and resurface things you’ve saved. Even worse, you can’t access them outside of a particular ecosystem.

Our goal is to improve how teams and individuals deal with their bookmarks. We want to bring back a passion for collecting!

## Made by an Indie Developer

There’s no need these days to have dozens of people to create great software.
Modern cloud technologies give everybody the power to create solid and reliable apps that can serve millions of users and terabytes of data.

That’s why it’s possible to develop and maintain an app like this alone.

### Author

Hi! My name is Rustem Mussabekov.
I have a computer science degree and nine years of experience as UI/UX designer in commercial products.

My passion for building apps began to blossom when I discovered Visual Basic 6. The idea that I could draw an elements and then translate them into a working app was blew my mind. Now, this is what I doing in daily basis.

Raindrop.io is my main job and a single source of income.

## What about privacy? {#privacy}

I don’t sell data, I sell software. The only way I make money is through direct sales of the app to you. This revenue is enough to stay independent, ignore funding and focus on product, instead of finding more ways to monetize.

Raindrop.io is designed to be a private workspace.
On Raindrop.io you have total control over who has access to anything, and we’re private by default.
You are able to collaborate with your colleague in one collection, an external client in another, and also have space for your own references and inspiration.

No ads and tracking. You have enough websites tracking you all over the internet and trying to get you to buy their stuff, on Raindrop.io you can cut through all that noise and focus on getting stuff done.

Source code of all of our apps is open source. Anyone can examine code and know what exactly happen behind the scene. Check our [Github repositories](https://github.com/raindropio).

## Security

The safety of your data is a crucial part of Raindrop.io’s DNA.
At any given time, there are three copies of your data in globally distributed data centers. If failure happens, I can restore to any time in the previous 24h, thanks to continuous backup of the database.

### 100% cloud-based architecture

Raindrop.io have Serverless Architecture. This modern approach creates highly available services that automatically scale with zero administration. This way you can expect almost zero downtimes.

Raindrop.io uses Amazon Web Services for processing and storage, and thus inherits their state of the art security levels.
It features a dedicated firewall, key-based SSH login, and extensive monitoring features. Only I have direct access to the hosting machines and their logins are secured using two factor authentication.

The hosting system is kept up to date perpetually and monitored against intrusion. All Raindrop.io user connections are encrypted using HTTPS using state of the art RSA 2048 bits keys. Its configuration supports current security features such as PFS and SHA256 digests. Its Qualys SSL Rating is «A».

Direct file access is protected behind the following security measures:

- Direct file URL is temporary and expire after 10 minutes
- Unauthorized access is prohibited unless you make a parent collection public

If you want to be even more confident, just use our [automatic backup solution](HOME-MTHRFCKR/DEV-DOCS/raindrop-io/help-docs/backups.md#automatic) that supports Dropbox or Google Drive at the moment.
