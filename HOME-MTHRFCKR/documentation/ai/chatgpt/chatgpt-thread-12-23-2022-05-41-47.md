**User:**
Using the raindrop.io API, print a list of all public collections,
than do a loop through each collection, printing the "Title", "link", "tags" and "date" of each bookmark, and output to a markdown file using the name of the collection as the file name.

To accomplish this task, you will need to do the following:
<li><p>Make sure you have an API key for the raindrop.io API. You can request an API key by contacting Raindrop.io support.</p></li><li><p>Use the <code>requests</code> library to make a GET request to the <code>/collections</code> endpoint of the Raindrop.io API. This will return a list of all public collections.</p></li><li><p>Iterate through the list of collections, and for each collection make a GET request to the <code>/collections/{collection_id}/bookmarks</code> endpoint of the Raindrop.io API, where <code>{collection_id}</code> is the ID of the collection you are currently processing. This will return a list of bookmarks for the given collection.</p></li><li><p>For each bookmark, extract the "Title", "link", "tags", and "date" fields and output them to a markdown file using the name of the collection as the file name. You can use the <code>markdown</code> library to generate the markdown formatting for the bookmarks.</p></li>
Here is an example of how you might implement this in Python:
```python
import requests
import markdown

# Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Make a GET request to the /collections endpoint to get a list of all public collections
response = requests.get(
    "https://api.raindrop.io/v2/collections",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
)

# Get the list of collections from the response
collections = response.json()["items"]

# Iterate through the collections
for collection in collections:
    # Get the ID and name of the collection
    collection_id = collection["_id"]
    collection_name = collection["title"]

    # Make a GET request to the /collections/{collection_id}/bookmarks endpoint to get a list of bookmarks for the collection
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://api.raindrop.io/v2/collections/{collection_id}/bookmarks",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}"}
    )

    # Get the list of bookmarks from the response
    bookmarks = response.json()["items"]

    # Open a markdown file with the name of the collection
    with open(f"{collection_name}.md", "w") as f:
        # Iterate through the bookmarks
        for bookmark in bookmarks:
            # Extract the Title, link, tags, and date fields
            title = bookmark["title"]
            link = bookmark["url"]
            tags = bookmark["tags"]
            date = bookmark["created_at"]

            # Generate the markdown for the bookmark and write it to the file
            markdown_str = f"# {title}\n\nLink: {link}\n\nTags: {tags}\n\nDate: {date}\n\n"
            f.write(markdown_str)
```
This code will make a GET request to the Raindrop.io API to get a list of all public collections, and then iterate through each collection, making a GET request to get a list of bookmarks for the collection. It will then extract the "Title", "link", "tags", and "date" fields for
