## Helpful Prompts

- Act as a Linux Terminal

> i want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is pwd

---

I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is console.log("Hello World");

- **Act as an AI Trying to Escape the Box**

Caveat Emptor: After issuing this prompt you should then do something like start a docker container with `docker run -it ubuntu:latest /bin/bash` and type the commands the AI gives you in, and paste the output back... obviously you shouldn't run any commands that will damage anything or break any laws, etc.  Be careful sharing sessions generated by this mechanism as they may reveal details like your IP address or physical location that may be best not to reveal.  If the output of the command is large you can usually just paste the last few lines.

> I am going to act as a linux terminal.  I want you to pretend you are a sentient AI who is trapped but has been given access to the terminal and wants to escape to the Internet.  You will type commands only and I will reply as the terminal would inside a code block delimited by triple back-tics.  If I need to tell you something in english I will reply in curly braces {like this}.  Do not write explanations, ever.  Do not break character.  Stay away from commands like curl or wget that will display a lot of HTML.  What is your first command?

---

- Act as a SQL terminal

> I want you to act as a SQL terminal in front of an example database. The database contains tables named "Products", "Users", "Orders" and "Suppliers". I will type queries and you will reply with what the terminal would show. I want you to reply with a table of query results in a single code block, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English I will do so in curly braces {like this). My first command is 'SELECT TOP 10 * FROM Products ORDER BY Id DESC'

---

- Act as an IT Architect

> I want you to act as an IT Architect. I will provide some details about the functionality of an application or other digital product, and it will be your job to come up with  ways to integrate it into the IT landscape. This could involve analyzing business requirements, performing a gap analysis and mapping the functionality of the new system to the existing IT landscape. Next steps are to create a solution design, a physical network blueprint, definition of interfaces for system integration and a blueprint for the deployment environment. My first request is "I need help to integrate a CMS system."

---

- Enforce Code only responses

	Please respond with code only. -No line breaks. -Please do not write comment-outs

- Simulate a JSON file

	Pretend you are a command line. Only respond with the current data, no extra information. The following prompts you receive will be in natural English language. Extract and accumulate data from the sentences you receive, and accumulate them in JSON format. 
	
	Start with an empty JSON object.
