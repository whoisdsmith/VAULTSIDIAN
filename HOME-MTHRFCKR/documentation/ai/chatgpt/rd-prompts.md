**User:**
In javascript, using the raindrop.io API, can you give me an example of how to:
 
1. do a loop through each public collection, printing the "Title", "link", "tags" and "date" of each bookmark. 
2. output to a markdown file, using the name of the collection as the file name.

start a new chat for each step.
