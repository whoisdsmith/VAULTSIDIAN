# deca-durabolin

Step 1: Obtain Raw Materials: The raw materials for manufacturing Deca Durabolin are Nandrolone Decanoate, Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Benzoate. Nandrolone Decanoate can be purchased from chemical suppliers such as Sigma-Aldrich or from a local pharmacy. Benzyl Alcohol and Benzyl Benzoate can be purchased from chemical suppliers such as Spectrum or Fisher Scientific.

Step 2: Prepare the Solutions: In a clean and sterile environment, prepare 2 separate solutions. Solution 1 should contain 2 grams of Nandrolone Decanoate and 5 ml of Benzyl Alcohol. Solution 2 should contain 5 ml of Benzyl Benzoate.

Step 3: Mix the Solutions: Carefully mix the two solutions together in a sterile environment until a homogenous solution is obtained.

Step 4: Filter the Solution: Filter the solution through a sterile filter paper or 0.22 micron filter to ensure that the solution is free from any contaminants.

Step 5: Fill the Vials: Carefully fill the sterile vials with the solution. Make sure to leave some headspace in the vials for the solution to expand when it is frozen.

Step 6: Freeze the Vials: Place the vials in a sterile container and place them in a freezer for about 24 hours. This will allow the solution to solidify into a powder.

Step 7: Package the Vials: Carefully package the vials in a sterile container and label them appropriately.

Step 8: Store the Vials: Store the vials in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
