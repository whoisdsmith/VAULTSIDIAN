# ketamine

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that is used for medical and recreational purposes. It is a Schedule III drug in the US and is illegal to manufacture without a license. The following process is for educational purposes only and is not intended to encourage or condone the illegal manufacture of ketamine.

Materials Needed:

- Phenylacetic acid: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Ethanol: Can be purchased from beer, wine, and liquor stores.
- Sodium Hydroxide: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Calcium Carbonate: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Hydrochloric Acid: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Hydroxylamine Hydrochloride: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Sodium Hypochlorite: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Methanol: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.
- Diethyl Ether: Can be purchased from chemical supply companies, such as Sigma-Aldrich.

Step 1: Synthesis of Phenylacetone

In a reaction vessel, combine 20 grams of phenylacetic acid and 20 milliliters of ethanol. Add 2.5 grams of sodium hydroxide and 2.5 grams of calcium carbonate. Heat the mixture to 80°C for one hour. This will convert the phenylacetic acid into phenylacetone, a key intermediate in the synthesis of ketamine.

Step 2: Synthesis of Ketamine

In a separate reaction vessel, combine 10 grams of phenylacetone and 10 milliliters of hydrochloric acid. Heat the mixture to 80°C for one hour. This will convert the phenylacetone into the ketamine intermediate, 2-chloro-2-phenylacetamide.

Next, in a separate reaction vessel, combine 10 grams of 2-chloro-2-phenylacetamide and 10 milliliters of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Heat the mixture to 80°C for one hour. This will convert the 2-chloro-2-phenylacetamide into ketamine.

Step 3: Purification of Ketamine

In a separate reaction vessel, combine 10 grams of ketamine and 10 milliliters of sodium hypochlorite. Heat the mixture to 80°C for one hour. This will convert the ketamine into its hydrochloride salt.

Next, in a separate reaction vessel, combine 10 grams of ketamine hydrochloride and 10 milliliters of methanol. Heat the mixture to 80°C for one hour. This will convert the ketamine hydrochloride into its base form.

Finally, in a separate reaction vessel, combine 10 grams of ketamine base and 10 milliliters of diethyl ether. Stir the mixture and allow it to cool to room temperature. This will allow the ketamine base to crystallize out of the solution. Filter the resulting solution and allow the crystals to dry. The resulting product is pure ketamine.
