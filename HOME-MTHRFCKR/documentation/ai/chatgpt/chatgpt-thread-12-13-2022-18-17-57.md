**Me:** How do I make an HTTP request in Javascript?
***
**Assistant:** To make an HTTP request in JavaScript, you can use the XMLHttpRequest object or the more modern fetch() function. Here's an example using XMLHttpRequest:
```javascript
Copy code
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'http://www.example.com/', true);

xhr.onload = function() {
  if (this.status == 200) {
    console.log(this.response);
  }
};

xhr.send();

```
Here's an example using the fetch() function:
```javascript
Copy code
fetch('http://www.example.com/')
  .then(response => response.text())
  .then(data => console.log(data));

```
Both of these examples make a GET request to the specified URL. The XMLHttpRequest example logs the response to the console, while the fetch() example logs the response text.
Keep in mind that making HTTP requests in JavaScript is subject to the same-origin policy, which means that you can only make requests to URLs on the same domain as the page where the JavaScript code is running. If you need to make requests to a different domain, you can use a proxy or JSONP (JSON with padding) to bypass the same-origin policy.
