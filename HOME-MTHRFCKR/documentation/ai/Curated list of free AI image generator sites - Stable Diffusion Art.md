Perfect for first timer getting a taste of Stable Diffusion. It’s a HuggingFace Demo. No sign up required. Not a lot of people are using it these days so speed is decent. 4 images at a time, but almost no customization. They also have a [v2.1 version](https://huggingface.co/spaces/stabilityai/stable-diffusion) supporting [negative prompts](https://stable-diffusion-art.com/how-to-use-negative-prompts/) but its a bit slower.

### [**Mage Space**](https://www.mage.space/)

![](https://i0.wp.com/stable-diffusion-art.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/image-49.png?resize=480%2C235&ssl=1)

**Mage Space** has simple interface. Basic images with 1.5 model does not require signing up. After signing up a free account, you can use advanced options like negative prompt and v2 model. Paid plan buys to access to different models.

Playground AI combines image creation and social network. You can create, share and like images, and follow creators. The rendering option is limited but speed is pretty good. Remixing image is an interesting feature. Only base models are available.

### [**Dream Studio**](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/dream)

Free Stable Diffusion image generator. No additional options.

#### [**Stable Horde**](https://aqualxx.github.io/stable-ui/)

DALL-E mini model. Completely free and requires no sign-up. Rendering is a bit slow.

#### [AI art maker by hotpot.ai](https://hotpot.ai/art-maker)
