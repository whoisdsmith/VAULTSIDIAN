# Take Your Github Repository To The Next Level - DEV Community

---

I’ve been using Github for a very long time now, and along the way I’ve been gathering a step-by-step guide on creating the perfect Github repository. If you haven’t guessed already, this article is an enhanced version of that guide.

So without further ado, let’s get started!

— Inspired from [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics).

To help other people find and contribute to your project, you can add topics to your repository related to your project's intended purpose, subject area, affinity groups, or other important qualities.

With topics, you can explore repositories in a particular subject area, find projects to contribute to, and discover new solutions to a specific problem.

To browse the most used topics, go to [https://github.com/topics/](https://github.com/topics/).

— Inspired from [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/allbusiness/2016/10/23/12-tips-for-naming-your-startup-business/).

Finding the right name for your project can have a significant impact on your success.

The wrong name can do worse than fail to connect with users. In contrast, a clear, powerful name can be extremely helpful in your marketing and branding efforts.

Here are 12 helpful suggestions on how to come up with a winning name for your project:

1. **Avoid hard-to-spell names.**

2. **Conduct a thorough Internet search.**

3. **Get the .dev or .io domain name.**

4. **Use a name that conveys some meaning.**

5. **Get feedback on the name.**

6. **Make sure the name sounds good when said aloud.**

7. **Use resources available for brainstorming names:**

| Repository | Name | Description |

[![Cover](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0Yeqx3x5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6i0zgv6zcb1zcwnqfvze.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--0Yeqx3x5--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/6i0zgv6zcb1zcwnqfvze.png)

There’s no doubt that projects with eye-catching images *usually* perform better than those without these elements.

Users are more likely to support a project that has an attention-grabbing cover image, because it creates a sense of professionalism and creativity.

But you don’t have to be a designer to create amazing visuals for your project, because there’s a dizzying amount of free graphic design tools on the Internet:

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/graphic-design-tool/)
- [VistaCreate](https://create.vista.com/)
- [Desygner](https://desygner.com/)

[![Badges](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XOCR9wvM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1p7mjlqi8t7w663gvvqm.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--XOCR9wvM--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1p7mjlqi8t7w663gvvqm.png)

Ever noticed those small images sitting at the top of the most performing Github projects? They’re called badges, and they can be used to show more information without using any words.

Here are some examples:

You can find all of these and more in the [Shilds.io](https://shields.io/) website. You can also use [Badgen](https://badgen.net/) to quickly generate new badges for your project!

— Inspired from [18F](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/blob/18f-pages/pages/making-readmes-readable.md).

This is your chance to explain the project in one paragraph. If you do this well, you can captivate the reader into exploring more of your project and eventually using it!

In general, the description should answer a short list of basic questions:

- **What is this repo or project?**
- **How does it work?**
- **Who will use this repo or project?**
- **What is the goal of this project?**

If you follow these steps, not only will it be easier for developers to know how to become involved with the project, but it will be easy for non-coders to understand what the code is designed to do, and how they too can become involved!

People love animated imagery! You can use GIFs to visually show many things:

- How your program is used.
- The best features of your program.
- A visual guide to achieve some specific task.

And there’s a wide variety of free tools that you can use to create said videos, including but not limited to:

- [Ascii Cinema](https://asciinema.org/) to record your terminal sessions.
- [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) or [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to record any part of your screen.
- [Veed](https://www.veed.io/) to edit videos online.

[![Installation](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ik-NZbU6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/35vo9t0amck2rlcvevfz.gif)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Ik-NZbU6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_66%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/35vo9t0amck2rlcvevfz.gif)

If the user has to install your program before using it, you should add a detailed section that explains how the user can do it. Here are some general rules to follow:

- Don’t jump any steps.
- Have different sections for each operation system (Linux, macOS, Windows).
- Show how the user can fix the most common errors.

I also recommend using the HTML [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) tag to create a collapsing menu. It results in a much cleaner README file!

You should show the user examples of how they can use your software, and the expected outputs too if you can. This will help prevent confusion about how your program works, and create a better bond between your software and its users.

This section, also called the **“FAQ”** (frequently asked questions), should be left to contain the most common questions that your users ask. Too many people asking where to find the settings panel? Put the answer in here so no one has to ask again.

There’s nothing better than a nice community! If the user ever needs help, they can reach out, ask a question, and get a valuable answer to their problem!

Here are 3 general steps towards building a great community for your project:

### [](https://dev.to/eludadev/take-your-github-repository-to-the-next-level-17ge?signin=true#step-91-lets-connect)Step 9.1 - Let’s Connect

Add a “Let’s Connect!” section to your README, where you reveal several links to the platforms where your community resides: [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Gitter](https://gitter.im/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), or even simply an email address!

### [](https://dev.to/eludadev/take-your-github-repository-to-the-next-level-17ge?signin=true#step-92-discussions-optional)Step 9.2 - Discussions *(optional)*

You can use GitHub Discussions in a repository as a place for your community to have conversations, ask questions, and post answers without scoping work in an issue.

[Here’s a guide on how to enable discussions for your repository.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/enabling-or-disabling-github-discussions-for-a-repository)

### [](https://dev.to/eludadev/take-your-github-repository-to-the-next-level-17ge?signin=true#step-93-code-of-conduct)Step 9.3 - Code of Conduct

— Taken from [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project).

Adopt a code of conduct to define community standards, signal a welcoming and inclusive project, and outline procedures for handling abuse.

A *code of conduct* defines standards for how to engage in a community. It signals an inclusive environment that respects all contributions.

You should have a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file in your repo that explains all the details that need to be known.

[Here’s a guide on how to create a code of conduct for your community.](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project)

[And here’s a template of a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file that you can freely use in your own work.](https://github.com/probot/template/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## [](https://dev.to/eludadev/take-your-github-repository-to-the-next-level-17ge?signin=true#step-10-create-contribution-guidelines-constructionworker)Step 10. Create Contribution Guidelines 👷

[![Contributions](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YcE55YUR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/34d9k1gpoxyttecdfpi4.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YcE55YUR--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/34d9k1gpoxyttecdfpi4.png)

— Inspired from [18F](https://github.com/18F/open-source-guide/blob/18f-pages/pages/making-readmes-readable.md).

Since open-source inherently welcomes outside contributors, it’s important to explicitly state how they can help and what they can help with. This document should answer the following question: **How can outside contributors become involved?**

You should include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in your repo, which outlines the following:

- If there are any additional setup steps specific for development.
- Whether there are explicit Instructions for running tests before contributions are accepted.
- Whether potential contributors should ask before they make significant changes.

[Here’s a template of a `CONTRIBUTIONS.md` file.](https://github.com/probot/template/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

— Inspired from [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository).

Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.

There’s a [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) tool online that can freely help you choose a license for your project. You should include a `LICENSE` file (file extension is optional) that includes the legal excerpt that’s accompagnied by your chosen license.

But remember that you're under no obligation to choose a license. However, without a license, the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work.

You should [add a page to your project’s wikis](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/adding-or-editing-wiki-pages) that describes your plans for the future. This is your chance to specify your upcoming plans, and to show that your project has a long-term future. Be ambitious within the bounds of realism.

What features are you going to add in the next version? When do you plan to release those features that users can’t wait for? Answer all these questions in the roadmap.

Github has a [releases feature](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) that lets you show a history of your project’s versions. In every release, you should [write a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) that describes what’s new and what was removed from that version.

[![Social Preview](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dHwgUhj_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmk42igm2mofbb2vkxkp.png)](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--dHwgUhj_--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/fmk42igm2mofbb2vkxkp.png)

— Inspired from [CSS Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview).

You can customize the image displayed on social media platforms when someone links to your repository.

Until you add an image, repository links expand to show basic information about the repository and the owner's avatar, but [you can customize it](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/customizing-your-repositorys-social-media-preview) to look more attractive!

After doing all of the above tasks, there’s really only one step left that can *really* take your repository to the next level: **launching a website!**

You can use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to freely host a website straight from your repository. Creating a custom webpage for your project allows you to be more creative, and dramatically increases your chances to be discovered by search engines.

Don’t miss your chance to get that extra traffic!
