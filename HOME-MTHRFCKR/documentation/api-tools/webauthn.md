## A Demo of the WebAuthn Specification

# What is WebAuthn?

Welcome to webauthn.io! This site is designed by [Duo Labs](https://duo.com/labs) to test the new W3C Specification Web Authentication. WebAuthn is supported in the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge browsers to different degrees, but support for credential creation and assertion using a U2F Token, like those provided by Yubico and Feitian, is supported by all of them. The code for this demo can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/duo-labs/webauthn.io). To read more about WebAuthn and what it does, check out [webauthn.guide](https://webauthn.guide) for an introduction.
