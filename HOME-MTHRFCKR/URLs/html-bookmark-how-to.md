### To Add a Bookmark with a Favicon in HTML, You Can Use the Following Code

```
<a href="http://www.example.com" title="Bookmark Title" rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png">Bookmark Link</a>

```

This will create a bookmark link with the specified title and favicon. The `rel` attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document, in this case, the favicon. The `type` attribute specifies the type of the favicon image, which should be an image file such as PNG or JPEG.

Note that this code assumes that you have already created a favicon image and uploaded it to your website. You can use an online favicon generator to create a favicon image and then upload it to your website.

Here's an example of how the code would look in a complete HTML page:

```
<html>
<head>
<title>Bookmark with Favicon</title>
</head>
<body>
<a href="http://www.example.com" title="Bookmark Title" rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png">Bookmark Link</a>
</body>
</html>

```

When rendered in a web browser, this code will create a bookmark link with the specified title and favicon. Clicking on the bookmark link will take the user to the specified URL.

<link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">

Replace "favicon.ico" with the URL of your favicon image, "bookmark-url" with the URL of the bookmark, and "Bookmark Title" with the title of the bookmark. This will create a link to the bookmark with the specified favicon displayed next to it.
