# **Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) Explained**

---

This section provides additional information about what URLs are and how URL Manager Pro handles them.  

## **Syntax of URLs**

---

A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the format in which an Internet address is stored. It takes the format:  

- protocol
- username
- password
- hostname
- port
- path
- document

---

For example, the URL of this document could be:  

 http://www.url-manager.com/doc/manual.pdfÂ  

where

 http:// 

is the protocol indicating the URL is the address of a Web page  

 http://www.url-manager.com/ 

is the name of the host computer,

 /doc/ 

is the path (also called a subdirectory) on that computer

and

 manual.pdf 

is the name of the document.

---

The URL of a password-protected page looks like this (not used much anymore)

 http://myfriends:secret@www.address.edu/index.html

---

Note:

- username, password, path and document are optional elements of a URL
- some URLs only consist of a prefix and hostname
- Others are just a path and document.
- A document can also be a program, such as a Perl script.

---

URLs were originally intended for internal use by Internet programs, not to be seen by end users.

- As a result, they are not particularly user-friendly.
- They can be long and arcane-looking.
- URL Manager Pro does its best to shield you from the complexity of URLs by representing them with icons and allowing you to give them a descriptive label.
- It allows you to access and manipulate URLs by convenient techniques, such as pull-down menus and Drag & Drop.

## **Types of URLs**

---

- By far, the most common type of URL you will save in URL Manager Pro will be Web pages.
- However, URL Manager Pro also recognises other types of URLs including
  - Web addresses,
  - email addresses,
  - FTP hosts,
  - Newsgroup addresses,
  - Telnet hosts,
  - Finger hosts,
  - Gopher addresses
  - and Query URLs.
