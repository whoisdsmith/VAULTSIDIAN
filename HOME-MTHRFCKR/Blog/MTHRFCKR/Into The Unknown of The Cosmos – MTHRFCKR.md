This Release is Dedicated to my Father who passed away last February. The first two tracks were written for him and the rest are old songs of mine that were his favorite.

Track 05, 07, 10, and 11 are songs that I was going to finish but decided to release them in the same way he had last heard them.

This is for you Dad. I miss you and I love you all the way Into The Unknown of The Cosmos.
