Dear son, I know it’s only been 3 days since you got in that van and drove away. I can’t help that I miss you already, Michigan just isn’t the same.

Please know that I’m doing my best and I will call as often as I can. I hope you like the new state you’re in, I can’t wait till I see you again

Hey Georgia, If you’re listening please shine bright for my baby and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

Dear son, I know you’re growing up so fast, Just stay this little until you come back.  I think about you every minute of the day without you this house isn’t the same.

School starts in just a few weeks, please listen to your mom while she’s  trying to teach. I hear 1st grade is a lot of fun, enjoy these moments before they are gone.

Hey Georgia, If you’re listening please shine bright for my baby. And lately I’m counting the days till you’re here for the holidays

I know that this isn’t fair but that doesn’t mean that I don’t care and hey B, if your ears are open, please tell E that I love him

She said “I’m so sorry, please don’t hate me” and I knew that she meant it cause she knows what it’s like without him. I replied “it’s fine and I don’t hate you, I forgive you” and I meant it cause I know what it’s like to be in love

As I waved goodbye, tears became oceans, and I knew that I was human. There is no greater love than the one for my son and there is no greater loss then watching him drive off, into the future without me. I am left behind  
struggling hard to find who I am with you.  Everything I do has all been cause of you, son you are the best thing to happen to me. I am proud of who you are. I hope you know you make proud. I hope I told you I loved you enough, but what is enough when I could never run out of love for you.

Hey Everett, turn your speakers up and sing along. As I tell the world this is your song.
