# The Failure of Time Invention – Between You and I/Between You and Me – MTHRFCKR

---

## [Uncategorized](https://whoisdsmith.ctrlaltback.space/category/uncategorized/) · August 8, 2011

I am in the process of writing a concept record about the past, present and future relationship with my sons mother. I think a lot of people will relate to it because we have all loved and lost. I only have about 10% of this record completed but the cover art is finished, I knew exactly what and how I wanted it to be. The people in it are not me nor anyone I know, just very fitting for the story I am telling..

The first is the front cover and the second is the back cover.
