A couple years ago I created a set of fictional characters for a concept album I was writing, it’s basically a soundtrack for an epic symphony and orchestra, with an outer space theme.

The story is based off its main character “**Astronaudia”** whose real name is **Naudia Lightbringer.**

Naudia is an Astrophysicist who follows in the foot steps of her missing father. She discovers the last project her father was working on before he disappeared was an advanced spacecraft that can travel to multiple Universes.

While developing both the character and the album I came across a TED talk by **Kelly Holley-Bockelmann** called “**The Spacetime Symphony of Gravitational Waves**” that inspired me to create more of what I now call **“The Naudia Project”**

I composed a score based off **“The Spacetime Symphony of Gravitational Waves”** and it shares the same title as this TED talk as well.

I used my favorite parts of Kelley’s talk in the song as well.

I have posted the song and transcript below.

It’s like this,

Every time human beings look at the universe in a different way,

Like, if we look in a different wavelength of light or when we look through a microscope for the first time,

We discover something very different about our Universe.

Every time, that changes our perspective of the Universe.

And now we’re going to get another change

Remember, you are matter.

You move.

All throughout your life you make a Gravitational-Wave.

Every move,

Every choice you make all throughout your life,

Is making a Gravitational-Wave

Propagating away from you at the speed of light and long after you’re gone,

That imprint that you have made in The Universe will exist.

And when I held my two kids for the first time That’s written on space-time too.

Sorry

So I just want to end with the idea that your choices matter.

They’re going to be part of the universe

And the things that we do now are going to be traveling away from us,

As a wave in the Cosmos at the speed of light, eventually reaching those very stars that I was looking at when I was a little girl .

So remember,

**Your choices matter** **and they’re written in The Universe**
