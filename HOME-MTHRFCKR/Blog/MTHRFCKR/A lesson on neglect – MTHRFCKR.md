# A Lesson on Neglect – MTHRFCKR

---

## [Uncategorized](https://whoisdsmith.ctrlaltback.space/category/uncategorized/) · August 21, 2011

This house is empty and so am I.

Regrets haunt me, they eat through these bones and into my soul

I watched you grow up through pictures and phone lines. 

If I could go back I would change everything, I didn’t know my job would tear us apart, I didn’t know how much I neglected you. A lesson I had to learn too late, by the time I realized what I had done you were gone. 

The hardest lessons we learn too late.  
My chest is empty with out you with me

**I Miss You Every Day.**

I wish you I could hear your laugh and voice one more time. I miss your humor, your wisdom and the way you made light out of all the darkness.
