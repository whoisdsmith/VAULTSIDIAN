# Your Room in Blue. – MTHRFCKR

## [Uncategorized](https://whoisdsmith.ctrlaltback.space/category/uncategorized/) · August 10, 2011

Let’s take this back to 02 when it was just me and you and the world was so small. Let’s take the bikes down the boardwalk and throw rocks in the river, can we stop for ice cream?

This was you and I on those april nights painting your room in blue, we signed our initials and I got paint all over you. Do you remember?

Let’s take this back to the summer of 05, where there’s a baby and a bottle and getting up at night. You were there but I was not, I missed the best parts of his entire first year

And I’m sorry, you know that I am sorry. Can we please just get along? I am holding onto my head to keep it intact cause you know that I was wrong. 

We were lovers without friendship and fighting was all we knew, but we were just kids. 

You hurt me and I hurt you, in the end it’s all we knew. I’m trying to keep my head in tact cause I was wrong but so were you.

Everyone has something to say about me to you, and I’ll take my share of the blame if you do too. 

Let’s take this to the present, we hardly speak anymore, is it because I couldn’t let go or is it something more?  
Its been four years and I’m learning to forgive, we had Everett together but now it’s like I don’t exist

I’ve grown up enough to know you did what you had to do, but its the simple things that still keep me confused. One day I hope we can grow as friends, you don’t know what it’s like to be on my end.

So let’s take this back to that fall night when we first met, let’s start over and let’s be friends
