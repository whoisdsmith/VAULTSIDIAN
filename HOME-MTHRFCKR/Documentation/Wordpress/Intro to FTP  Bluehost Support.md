# Intro to FTP

## Overview

FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol. As the name suggests, it is used to transfer files and folders between your local machine (desktop) and your hosting account.  
  
We have provided guides to demonstrate how to set up the most common FTP programs, Filezilla, Cyberduck, and Fetch. We will also show how to manage files using the File Manager in the cPanel.
