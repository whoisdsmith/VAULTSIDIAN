## Why your business needs a blog

There are many advantages to having a business blog. Some of the notable benefits include: 

1: Market your business

2: Drive traffic to your website and improve your search ranking

3: Raise brand awareness

4: Convert visitors into leads and customers

5: Repurpose content for other media outlets

Let’s explore these benefits in more detail.

### 1\. A blog helps market your business 

As mentioned earlier, a blog is one of the most cost-effective ways to market and promote your business. It doesn’t cost any extra money to get started. You can use your blog to share a variety of information about your business and products, which helps to demonstrate your expertise. Customers always prefer doing business with someone who is trustworthy and knows what they are doing. 

### 2\. Blogging drives traffic and improves your SEO 

The most crucial function of a website is to provide information. Hence, visitors will flock to your website if they know they can find informative, appealing content here. The more quality content you have, the more clicks you may get, and the longer people will stay on your site. This increase in clicks and visits may signal Google and other search engines that your site is helpful, which in turn helps with your website ranking higher on the search result page.  

In addition to this, you should try to “claim” keywords that relate to your business. This means that when someone searches for a particular keyword, your website shows up on the first page for that query. To “claim” keywords for any topics, you need to provide relevant information and cover the various aspects surrounding such topics.  Optimizing your pages to be found for relevant keywords is what we call SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

Embarking on a new blogging venture empowers you to create content that targets your primary keywords and related keywords.  Pair that with the fact that [search engines](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/giving-you-fresher-more-recent-search.html) love a website that’s regularly updated, and it’s easy to see how blogging helps improve your [search engine optimization](https://www.bluehost.com/resources/an-overview-of-seo/) (SEO) efforts and search engine rankings overall.

### 3\. Content raises brand awareness 

An original blog can help you raise brand awareness. Since blogging helps with SEO, your blog posts can serve as search results for relevant keywords. That means your blog posts can appear before new people and help introduce them to your brand and what you have to offer.

As a result, you don’t have to rely solely on ever-changing [social media](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/social-media-tools-to-enhance-your-website/) algorithms or pay for social media and online ads to get your business in front of new audiences. 

### 4\. A blog helps convert visitors into potential customers 

When you use your blog to demonstrate your experiences and expertise, people may find it easier to trust and do business with you. While you won’t convert 100% of your website visitors into leads and subscribers, some of them may wind up making a purchase, while others may end up subscribing to your email list to learn more about you.

According to [Semrush](https://www.semrush.com/blog/blogging-stats/), companies with blogs produce 67% more leads per month. Each blog post is a perfect opportunity to link to your services or products. 

You can also include a call-to-action such as booking a call, buying a product, scheduling an appointment, or downloading a free guide or another resource to boost your relationship with customers.

### 5\. You can repurpose blog content for social media 

Lastly, a blog gives you [plenty of content](https://www.bluehost.com/blog/52-content-ideas-for-your-website/) to repurpose for social media. Social media is a great place to connect with your audience. However, producing new content for different platforms is very time-consuming.

Instead of creating a content marketing strategy from scratch, you can use your blog posts to create social media content. 

**Some examples of how to turn a blog post into social media content:** 

1: Writing a short intro, and sharing a link to the blog post on your website 

2: Turn valuable information in your post into graphics/infographic  

3: Creating questions and inviting your followers to engage in a discussion 

4: Sharing different parts of your blog post as a series of tips 

5: Recording an audio version of your post and sharing it as a podcast 

6: Creating a video or a slideshow from a blog post 

With a bit of time and effort, you can easily create multiple pieces of content from one blog post. Then you will have ready-made content for all your social media platforms. 

## What a blog should consist of

Before we discuss how to add a blog to your website, let’s go over what information a blog typically consists of. A WordPress blog consists of blog posts that are presented in reverse chronological order on the blog page, meaning the most recent one shows up first. 

Blog pages (and individual blog posts) typically have a blog sidebar that consists of a brief author bio, links to your social media profiles, and a list of recent posts. Your sidebar can also include a newsletter sign-up form, links to your most popular products, or other types of information relevant to your business. Many blogs also place this information at the bottom of the blog/blog post instead of using a sidebar. 

As far as individual blog posts go, they have several key elements, including: 

**1: Title**: the blog post title that tells readers what the general topic of the post is. 

**2:** **Post content**: the content of your blog post where you talk about a particular topic more in-depth. As a general rule of thumb, your blog post should be as long as needed to provide readers with the information they need to know. And although it’s difficult to give you a word minimum, your blog post shouldn’t consist of just one or two short paragraphs as that doesn’t give you enough room to really go into a topic. 

**3: Featured image:** the [featured image](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/functionality/featured-images-post-thumbnails/) is used on the blog index/archive page and, depending on your blog design, at the top of your blog post. It serves as an accompanying visual that can help engage visitors and get them to click the post. Your featured image should try to encapsulate or represent your post content in a way. 

**4: Images and/or other media**: besides the featured image, you should include additional images and media types (such as audio and video content) into your blog posts to make them more visually engaging and interesting. Next to that, these media help to break your post into chunks and give readers a brief break from text content, which helps with concentration and eye fatigue.  

**5: Links to other blogs and websites:** your blog post should include links to other posts on your website and links to relevant external sources that can back up your main points. You really shouldn’t publish an article without any internal and external links. These links help to demonstrate your expertise and credibility because it shows you have an overview of what you write. It also helps search engines understand what your website is about and what kind of other content you have. Plus, it’s a good opportunity to invite visitors to read other interesting and relevant articles you have.

**6: Meta information:** information such as the [meta title](https://codex.wordpress.org/Meta_Tags_in_WordPress) and [meta description](https://www.bluehost.com/resources/the-ultimate-guide-to-wordpress-seo-settings/) appear on the search engine results pages. They are short snippets that give users an idea of what your blog post is about. Google will automatically generate those based on the content on your blog page.  
 

Before you create a Blog section on your page, you first need to properly set up your website. Start with setting up your hosting service, then choose a domain name, [install WordPress,](https://www.bluehost.com/help/article/install-wordpress) pick a WordPress theme or template and customize your homepage or landing page. If you have these elements set up in place, then you can move on to your blog. 

When you create a website with the Bluehost Website Builder, your website won’t have a blog by default. However, the Builder will still display a blog section.

That section is not an actual blog. It’s just a visual representation of what your blog posts will look like once you start publishing them. It’s an extension of what goes on in the WordPress dashboard. 

So, to add a blog to your website, you’ll need to click on the **Blog** section in the left-hand sidebar of the builder. You’ll get a popup screen that briefly tells you what will happen when you add a blog to your website:

1: You’ll be able to write blog posts using the WordPress editor as your blogging platform (without having to touch a line of [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)). 

2: You can also publish and display blog posts on any page on your website that you’ve designed with the Website Builder. 

3: In addition, you’ll get a blog page with a design that matches the rest of your website. 

Next, click the blue **Add blog to your site** button and wait for the builder to complete the process. This will add a blog to your website on the backend control panel that matches your existing website.

You can then use the editor to style how the blog posts will look on your website. Or you can just get started with publishing your first blog post.

If you click on **Design My Blog Page**, you’ll have the option to choose a layout for your blog page and customize options such as how many columns you want the blog page to have and whether or not you wish to display a featured image. 

![You have several blog design options to choose from](https://www.bluehost.com/resources/static/72d8706f73f291fc466c42cb5bc1e4b3/da8b6/You-have-several-blog-design-options-to-choose-from.png)

You can also add any other section above and below to make your blog page look exactly the way you want.

### Editing blog posts in WordPress 

To create your blog posts, you’ll use your WordPress dashboard area and the [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/) editor. You can easily access the dashboard by clicking the **cogwheel icon** on the blog post page while in the editor or clicking **Blog** on the left sidebar. 

To create a new post, click the **+New** button in the top bar in your WordPress dashboard, or go to **Posts > Add New** on the left sidebar. Then, use the editor to add blocks of content, images, links, and other elements we mentioned earlier. 

![Adding and editing blog posts should look familiar if you’ve used WordPress before](https://www.bluehost.com/resources/static/41d48a4669437ba91224c69c12ecbaf0/da8b6/Adding-and-editing-blog-posts-should-look-familiar-if-youve-used-WordPress-before.png)

When you’re done, hit the **Publish** button. Make sure to set the **Visibility** to public in the right sidebar. The blog post will then be published and be visible on your blog page as well as on any other page where you’ve used a Blog section.
