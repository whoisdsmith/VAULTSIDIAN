With a delay step, you can put your Zap on hold for a specified amount of time before your actions run. You can use delays to set up scheduled emails, get notified of incomplete tasks, send automatic follow-ups, and automate other tasks on your timeline.

There are three types of Zap delays:

1.  Delay for
2.  Delay until
3.  Delay after queue

The Delay After Queue option allows you to create a queue of actions to run. When a Zap is triggered, it adds actions to the queue. The queue then plays the actions one at a time in the order that they were added to the queue. There is a delay between each set of actions for a Zap.

This can be useful if you are running into limits with too many requests to an app, or if you have multiple Zaps that may try to update a record at the same time.

To use Delay After Queue:

The maximum time a task can be held for is for one month (31 days). Since tasks will be queued, the maximum number of tasks in the queue depends on the _Time Delayed For (value)_ value. For example, if you set the delay to one day, the maximum number of tasks in the queue will be 31. If a 32nd task is created within that period, it will error on the delay step because the scheduled time it will be released is too far away.

After setting up your delay, click **Test & Review** and check if the date matches the delay conditions youâ€™ve set up.

If you want your action(s) to run based on a recurring event that doesn't occur at fixed intervals, you can create a recurring event in Google Calendar and add a Google Calendar action to schedule your action(s).
