Whenever your Zap successfully completes an [action](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/set-up-your-zap-action), it counts as a task. Trigger steps do not count as tasks, but successful action steps do. You can see all the tasks your Zaps have attempted in [Zap History](https://zapier.com/app/history).

## [How tasks are counted](https://zapier.com/help/manage/history/learn-about-tasks-in-zapier#step-1)

The following count as tasks when your Zap runs:

If _Should This Step Be Considered a "success" When Nothing Is Found?_ is selected in a search step, the search action will count as a task.

The following do **not** count as tasks:

You have a Zap set up to trigger whenever you receive a new email with an attachment from Gmail, which then uploads the attachment to Dropbox, then sends you a direct message in Slack with a link to the new Dropbox file.

Each time you receive a new email with an attachment and your Zap uploads the attachment and sends you a direct message, it automates 2 tasks. If your Zap runs 10 times for 10 emails you receive, it automates 20 tasks.

## [Task limits and pricing](https://zapier.com/help/manage/history/learn-about-tasks-in-zapier#step-2)

Each [pricing plan](https://zapier.com/pricing) has different limits on the number of tasks your Zaps can automate in a given billing cycle. Zapier sends notifications when you reach 80% of your task limit, and then again when you reach your full task limit. At that point, Zapier will [hold new Zap runs](https://zapier.com/help/manage/history/view-and-manage-your-zap-history#holding).

You can [replay held Zap runs](https://zapier.com/help/manage/history/replay-failed-zap-runs) when you [upgrade your plan](https://zapier.com/help/account/billing-pricing/change-or-cancel-your-zapier-plan) or when your billing cycle resets.

## [Monitor task usage](https://zapier.com/help/manage/history/learn-about-tasks-in-zapier#step-3)

Your task limit is based on your billing cycle. In your [billing and usage settings](https://zapier.com/app/settings/billing), you can see how many tasks your Zaps have used in your current billing cycle, and how many days you have left until your task limit refreshes.

You can view all the tasks that your Zaps have attempted in your [Zap history](https://zapier.com/app/history).
