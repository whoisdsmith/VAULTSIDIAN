You can pick a specific value from an incoming list from an app with [Formatter’s](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/get-started-with-formatter)**Pick from list** transform.

If a survey field collects a respondent's top 5 vegetables but you only want to track the top vegetable, you can use the **Pick from list** transform to create a new field that contains only that item.

Before you can add a Formatter step to a Zap, you must [set up your Zap trigger](https://zapier.com/help/create/basics/set-up-your-zap-trigger).

___

## [1\. Add a Formatter step to your Zap](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/pick-from-a-list-of-items-in-zaps#add-a-formatter-step-to-your-zap)

___

## [2\. Customize your transformation](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/pick-from-a-list-of-items-in-zaps#customize-your-transformation)

To pick an item using the _Custom_ field, you can reference the item by its list position. The first list item will always be `0`. The second item is `1`, the third item is `2`, and so on.

You can also use negative numbers to count from the end of the list. `-1` will pick the last item, `-2` will pick the second-last item,and `-3` will pick the third-last item, and so on.

## [3\. Test your transformation](https://zapier.com/help/create/format/pick-from-a-list-of-items-in-zaps#test-your-transformation)

Click **Test & Review** to test the step. If it's successful, the step will return either one of the values from the input field or the default value.

Once you’ve set your Formatter step to pick a value from a list, you can add other actions to use the value in the rest of your Zap.
