[**Follow our quickstart to build your first workflow**](https://pipedream.com/docs/quickstart/).

Workflows make it easy to integrate your apps, data, and APIs - all with no servers or infrastructure to manage.

-   Workflows are composed of code that is organized and executed as a sequence of linear [**steps**](https://pipedream.com/docs/docs/workflows/steps/).
    
-   Trigger your workflow on any event (e.g., [HTTP requests](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps/triggers/#http) or a [schedule](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps/triggers/#schedule)).
    
-   Add steps to run Node.js [code](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps/code/) (using virtually any [`npm`](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/steps/code/#using-npm-packages) package) and [prebuilt actions](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/actions/).
    
-   Steps are executed in the order they appear in your workflow.
    
-   Export values for each step and access them via the `steps` object.
