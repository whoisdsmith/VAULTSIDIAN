Pipedream is the fastest way to automate any process that connects APIs. Build and run workflows with code-level control when you need it, and no code when you don't.

The Pipedream platform includes:

-   A [serverless runtime](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/) and [workflow service](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/)
-   Open source [triggers](https://pipedream.com/docs/workflows/triggers/) and [actions](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/actions/) for [hundreds of integrated apps (opens new window)](https://pipedream.com/explore/)
-   One-click [OAuth and key-based authentication](https://pipedream.com/docs/connected-accounts/) for hundreds of APIs (use tokens directly in code or with pre-built actions)

## [#](https://pipedream.com/docs/#open-source) Open Source

Pipedream maintains an [open source component registry (opens new window)](https://github.com/pipedreamhq/pipedream/) on GitHub so you can avoid writing boilerplate code for common API integrations. Use components as no code building blocks in workflows, or use them to scaffold code that you can customize. You can also [create a PR contribute new or enhanced components](https://pipedream.com/docs/components/guidelines/#process) via GitHub.
