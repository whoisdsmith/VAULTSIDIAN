# Postgresql

## Mac

### Install

```
asdf plugin-add postgres
asdf list all postgres
asdf install postgres 11.10
asdf global postgres 11.10

```

### Stop / Start / Restart

Run this command to manually start the server:  
`pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start`

Start manually:

`pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`

Stop manually:

`pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop` or `brew services stop postgresql`

### Check the listen_addresses and Port in postgresql.conf:

`egrep 'listen|port' /usr/local/var/postgres/postgresql.conf`

```
#listen_addresses = 'localhost'         # what IP address(es) to listen on;
#port = 5432                            # (change requires restart)
                                        # supported by the operating system:
                                        # supported by the operating system:
                                        #   %r = remote host and port
```

### Bug

- DB can't be connectted after Mac restart

```
psql: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
Is the server running locally and accepting
connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

[The problem can also be attributed to a crashed process that left postmaster.pid file behind.](https://dba.stackexchange.com/a/171580)

```
$ brew services stop postgresql
$ rm /usr/local/var/postgres/postmaster.pid # adjust path accordingly to your install
$ brew services start postgresql
```

# User

su - postgres
psql

When connecting to PostgreSQL on Linux for the first time many admins have questions, especially if those admins are from the MySQL world. By default, when PostgreSQL is installed, a `postgres` user is also added.

The first question many ask is, “What is the default password for the user postgres?” The answer is easy…there isn’t a default password. The default authentication mode for PostgreSQL is set to ident.

## Create User

```
createuser
```

# Drop Database

```
REVOKE CONNECT ON DATABASE dbname FROM PUBLIC, username;

// If PostgreSQL < 9.2
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(procpid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mydb';
// Else
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'mydb';
```
