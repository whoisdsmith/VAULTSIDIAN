## GDPR cookie consent

What is GDPR cookie consent?
GDPR cookie consent is when users give their informed, explicit, unambiguous consent to which cookies on your website they will allow to be activated and collect their personal data, while visiting your site. A compliant GDPR cookie consent must be granular, i.e. users must be able to choose some cookies rather than others and not be forced to simply accept or reject all.

## Do all Cookies require Opt-In?

https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/29083/gdpr-compliance-do-all-cookies-require-opt-in

Not all cookies require consent.

The current answers are in WP 29 Opinion 04/2012 on Cookie Consent Exemption - 00879/12/EN WP 194.

This WP29 Opinion is based upon Directive 2002/58/EC ("ePrivacy Directive"), and not GDPR, which is current law for this matter until other guidelines are adopted pursuant to GDPR or until the awaited "ePrivacy Regulation" is finally adopted.

## Strictly necessary cookies

However, you don't need consent where the cookie or other technology is "strictly necessary" to provide you with the service the user is seeking – for example, cookies which may be needed to provide you with a functioning website which the user wants to access.

Strictly necessary cookies — These cookies are essential for you to browse the website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the site. Cookies that allow web shops to hold your items in your cart while you are shopping online are an example of strictly necessary cookies. These cookies will generally be first-party session cookies. While it is not required to obtain consent for these cookies, what they do and why they are necessary should be explained to the user.

To comply with the regulations governing cookies under the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive you must:

- Receive users’ consent before you use any cookies **except** strictly necessary cookies.
- Provide accurate and specific information about the data each cookie tracks and its purpose in plain language before consent is received.
- Document and store consent received from users.
- Allow users to access your service even if they refuse to allow the use of certain cookies
- Make it as easy for users to withdraw their consent as it was for them to give their consent in the first place.
