## Result: Seattle, WA (2020)

Looks like you’re best suited to Seattle, one of the biggest tech hotspots in the country, especially when it comes to available jobs. (There are over 180,000, at present!) Industry giants like Amazon, Microsoft, and Expedia are based there, along with major retail companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom, and Costco. When it comes to lifestyle in the waterfront city, you’ll be able to enjoy the best the great outdoors has to offer while still living in a major metropolitan area. Housing is pricey, but there are plenty of neighborhoods to choose from. Coffee and craft brewed beers are major things there, so be prepared to get your fix.
