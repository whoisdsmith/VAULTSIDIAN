## Information and Inspiration

***

Early Inspiration came from Webby of weboas.is (RIP)

Lots of resources have come from FMHY Reddit and Divolt Channels (Shout out to @nbats)

Big Shoutout For The OSINT Resources goes out to Dean Da Costa and technisette

* This is very much an ongoing WIP, Theres Over 16,0000 Bookmarks Iâ€™ve Been Updating and Collecting Since 2008.
* Thereâ€™s Definitely Something Here For Everyone, If you Have Enough Time and Effort To Find It.
* My Goal Is To Turn This Into a Searchable and Visual Wiki/Digital Garden. **You can see the progress** [**Here**](https://mthrfkr.netlify.app/)
* All Bookmarks Have Been Exported From my Raindrop.io Account and Imported into Obsidian.
* Currently uploading from Obsidian directly to Github.

## Notes

***

**My Old Bookmarking Workflow Was:**

* Save URL to [Raindrop.io â€” All-in-one bookmark manager](https://raindrop.io/)
* Save URL to **Google Chrome Bookmarks**
* Export Chrome Bookmarks to Markdown Links Using The Chrome Extension [Improved Potato](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/improved-potato/kjnippnbinaiaophckfmlbicclieefpf)
* Import Markdown Export Into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

**My Current Bookmarking Workflow Is:**

* Save URL to [Raindrop.io â€” All-in-one bookmark manager](https://raindrop.io/)
* Newly Saved URLs Are Automatically Imported Into Obsidian and Updates This Repo, Using Raindrop To Obsidian Plugin
