    JAILED PERMASIGNED APP INSTALLER iOS 14 - 15.4.1
    
    
    
    
    An app has been released which allows you to install or sideload unlimited IPA's and the best thing is they will never expire unlike with AltStore and Sideloadly.

      * [Anonfiles mirror of TrollInstaller 1.1](https://anonfiles.com/Xai0u5A4y2/TrollInstaller_ipa)
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      * Install Trollinstaller via services like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/), [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/), etc.
    
    
      * Open Trollinstaller, click on “Install” Button & wait for it to be finished.
    
    
      * If your phone reboots here, go back to previous step.
    
    
      * An alert should pop up when TrollStore installed successfully, click close and the app should exit.
    
    
      * If TrollStore is on home screen, start it. If not, then reboot and it should appear afterwards. Then start it.
    
    
      * Go into the settings tab, hit "Install ldid" so TrollStore can install unsigned apps.
    
    
      * Tap "Install Persistence Helper" and choose a system app you don't need to use (e.g. Tips or Home) in the list that appears.
    
    
      * Optional : You now may delete “Trollinstaller” app if you see “TrollStore” on your homepage.
    
    
      * Next download or save an iPA file to be sideloaded on you iDevice.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    Very Important
    
    
    
    
    Save your iPA file in the “On My iPhone/iPad etc.” storage and not in “iCloud Drive”. Failing to do this step will probably result in failed iPA installation.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
      * Install the iPA Package by Opening the Share Sheet, and opening the file in “TrollStore”.
    
    
      * Profit.
