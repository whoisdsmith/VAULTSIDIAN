description: Not necessarily stoned, but beautiful.  Freq Echo is perfect for dub, Dr. Who, and all of your psychedelic needs.  Bode-Style Frequency Shifter + Analog Echo Emulation create surprising sonic effects. Subtle chorusing and double tracking to barberpole phasing and flanging to endless glissandos and runaway echos.  New in 1.2.0: VST3, signed & notarized installers that are ready for Big Sur, signed Windows installer!  New in 1.2.5 (for Mac): Native Intel and ARM builds!
