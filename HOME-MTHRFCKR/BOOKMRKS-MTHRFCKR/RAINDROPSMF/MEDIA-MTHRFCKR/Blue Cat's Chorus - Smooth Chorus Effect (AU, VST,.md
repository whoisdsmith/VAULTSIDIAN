description: From a light ensemble to a deep destructive modulation effect, Blue Cat's Chorus can just do anything, for free!  The Chorus effect was originally designed to simulate several voices, just as if several persons were playing together the same notes, but with a variable delay between them. This is one of the typical effects that you can get with Blue Cat's Chorus.
