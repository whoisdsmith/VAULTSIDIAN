# GitHub - adriansteffan/obsidian-to-jekyll: This is a simple python script that converts Obsidian notes to a format that is compatible with Jekyll themes that support wikilinks and backlinking like Jekyll Garden or Digital Garden Jekyll Template. It adds the filename to the frontmatter as a title and lets you set the visibility of your notes on a folder or note-by-note basis.
