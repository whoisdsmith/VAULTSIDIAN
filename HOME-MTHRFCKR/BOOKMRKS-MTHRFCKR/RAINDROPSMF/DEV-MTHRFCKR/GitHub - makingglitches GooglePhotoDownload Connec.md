# GitHub - makingglitches/GooglePhotoDownload: Connects to Google Photos and downloads all content, keeping track of original data on disk and moving files only on the computer and already on server to respective directories, and tries to download the entire collection and store size info for quicker startup as well as original file sizes of those on disk, downloading the files still on disk first so they can be freed up. Supports multiple user accounts. Its just a better mousetrap. Google Takeout prepares whole archives of photos, this allows you to download them separately and keep track of some statistics as well on space usage.
