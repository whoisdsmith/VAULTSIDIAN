# GitHub - ze-kel/DayOne-JSON-to-MD: Converts jsons from Day One app to Markdown. Intended for transferring from DayOne to Obsidian but should work with everything else. =====UPDATE=====: I made it to solve my specific need, and not really interested in working on it any further. Check out forks though, there seems to be a few improved implementations.
