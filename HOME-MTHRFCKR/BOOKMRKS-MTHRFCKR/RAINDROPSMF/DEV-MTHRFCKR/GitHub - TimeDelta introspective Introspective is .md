# GitHub - TimeDelta/introspective: Introspective is an iOS app that is focused on both mental and physical health. It is a new way to explore your health data. It allows you to write custom (easy-to-understand) queries against your data and create custom graphs that can show the relationship between different pieces of your health data.
