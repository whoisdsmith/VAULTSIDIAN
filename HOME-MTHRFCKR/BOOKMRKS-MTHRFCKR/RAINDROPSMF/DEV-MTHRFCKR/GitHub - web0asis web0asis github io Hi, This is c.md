# GitHub - web0asis/web0asis.github.io: Hi, This is clone of Weboas.is Dev posted about his/her suicide on the forum few days ago, as sad it is I wanted to make sure their legacy stays online for everyone who used this awesome website. I don't have much idea about website development so I just uploaded it as it is. R.I.P Weeby
