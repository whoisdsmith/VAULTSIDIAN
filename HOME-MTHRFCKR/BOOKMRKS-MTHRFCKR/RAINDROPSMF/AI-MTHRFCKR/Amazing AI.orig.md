description: Generate images from text using Stable Diffusion 1.5. Simply describe the image you desire, and the app will generate it for you like magic!

Developed exclusively for Apple silicon (M1/M2) - The app is NOT compatible with devices running on Intel chips.

The app runs offline on your computer and also includes support for Shortcuts.


■ Recommended System Requirements

16 GB of RAM


■ FAQ

‣ Why not use Stable Diffusion 2?

It will eventually be supported, but right now, it's worse than 1.5.

‣ Why does the app take up so much space on disk and memory?

The AI model used to generate images is large.

‣ Can you support inpainting?

I don't plan to support this.
