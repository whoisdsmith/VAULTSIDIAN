another amazing notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/multimodalart/latent-diffusion-notebook/blob/main/Latent_Diffusion_LAION_400M_model_text_to_image.ipynb

Bit of a different video this time, but I've been having a lot of fun with AI-generated imagery lately, so I figured I'd show some people how to get around the "too much traffic" popup from the dall-e mini demo.

Reupload because I forgot a step... shhh
