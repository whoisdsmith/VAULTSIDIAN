description: Joining EleutherAI is as simple as joining us on Discord and picking a project to contribute to. As an independent organization, we are dependent upon donations to power our compute. If you have a very large quantity of compute or compute credits, please contact us directly at contact[at]eleuther.ai Contributors are traditionally expected to have at some experience with machine learning and data science. While there is some work for people without that skillset, we are a DL research lab and therefore most work involves writing, training, and inferencing neural networks with industry-standard frameworks.
