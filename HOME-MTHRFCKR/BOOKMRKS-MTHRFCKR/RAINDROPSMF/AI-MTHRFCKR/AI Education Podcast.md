description: Lee Hickin, Beth Worrall, and Dan Bowen work in the Microsoft Australia and New Zealand team, they talk about Artificial Intelligence in Education - what it is, how it works, and the different ways it is being used. It's not too serious, or too technical, and is intended to be a good conversation of background information.  Please note that we're having a chat fortnightly, not describing the official Microsoft position on anything!
