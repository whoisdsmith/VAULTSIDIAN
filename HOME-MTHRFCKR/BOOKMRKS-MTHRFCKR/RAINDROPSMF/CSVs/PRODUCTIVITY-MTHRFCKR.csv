Building a Modern Memex - Andrew Louis,"The Memex was proposed in 1945 as the ultimate organizational tool. The desk-sized device would store a user’s personal library and allow for information to be searched, organized, connected together with hyperlinks, and shared.

Without a device like this, its creator suggested, our species would drown in information overload and come to a premature end.

Tragically, zero of these devices were ever produced, but 72 years later, Andrew has built a Memex in JavaScript. He's built importers for dozens of different sources of personal data and data consumptions and put it all behind a graph-based API.

He’ll be going over the history of the Memex and demoing his own version by showing what type of queries, organizing tools, and visualization are available.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0WU02flF_E,BOOKMRKS-MTHRFCKR / PRODUCTIVITY-MTHRFCKR / Memex,Productivity,"January 19, 2022 3:56 PM (UTC)",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/K0WU02flF_E/maxresdefault.jpg,
