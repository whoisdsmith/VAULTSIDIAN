description: I thought about the reasons behind these design decisions, so here are just some of my guesses. Day One 2.0 was supposed to take one year of development but spanned two years unexpectedly. For a team of a dozen developers, this is a huge project. As an engineer myself, just seeing you guys pull off a cloud syncing platform, a universal iOS application (iPhone + iPad), a watchOS app, and a Mac application all with full-fledged functionality leaves me no doubt that this is an excellent team equipped with amazing weapons of productivity.
