# DayOne and Time Travel

description: Brett Terpstra has posted a number of very cool things that can be done with the OS X and iOS application DayOne. They were so compelling that I gave in and bought the suite. They are all solid and attractive applications but it doesnâ€™t fit my workflow as well as plain text files. Logging If I am actively working on a problem, I record notes in Simplenote (big surprise). On Windows, I either use ResophNotes or the Simplenote Web site.
