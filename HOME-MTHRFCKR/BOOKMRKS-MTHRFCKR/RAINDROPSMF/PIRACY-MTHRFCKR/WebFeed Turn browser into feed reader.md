description: While the Internet is becoming more and more centralize, the open web feed technology like RSS and Atom is becoming less popular. People tends to share their article by the closed platform like Facebook or Twitter instead of independent blog with RSS or Atom. But why? Why the open technology are of no better than the closed one? I think one most signifiant advantage of the closed platform is their better use experience. It is not easy to subscribe a blog with web feed. This is why I develop the WebFeed browser extension, by which you can turn your browser into a simple feed subscriber and reader. And then the use experience of web feed like RSS or Atom will be more friendly.
