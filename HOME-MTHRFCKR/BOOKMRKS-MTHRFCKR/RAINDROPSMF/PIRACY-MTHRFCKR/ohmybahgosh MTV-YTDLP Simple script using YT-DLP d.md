# ohmybahgosh/MTV-YTDLP: Simple script using YT-DLP do download an episode from MTV.com, and then merge the resulting multiple output MP4 files using ffmpeg. MTV episodes are split in to multiple MP4 files, so resulting output for a single episode can be between 3-11+ MP4 files. This script is a band-aid for that.
