description: DNS or the Domain Name System turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.  FreeDNS allows you to configure easily your domain name absolutely for free.  You do not ever have to become a paying customer to use it.
