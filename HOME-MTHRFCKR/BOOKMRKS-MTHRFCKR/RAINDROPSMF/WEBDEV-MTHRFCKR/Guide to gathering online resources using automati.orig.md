description: Automatically gather resources that are relevant to your research, teaching, or studies. 

Build Applets that send you the latest online resources from your favorite publishers, bloggers, academics, or research center. Make one of these Applets your own and create a Google Sheets database of online resources. The Applet will automate data entry, so the spreadsheet is a resource that grows on its own. 

Drea from the IFTTT Team shows you 3 ways that you can build Applets that help you gather online resources.
