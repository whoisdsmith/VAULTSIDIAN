description: Hello all, I’m looking for some way to replicate a Siri Shortcut that I use on iOS wherein I pass markdown text from an app (or type it myself) and save a copy in DEVONthink To Go and make an entry in Day One under a journal of choice. How can I recreate this on the Mac? Ideally, I’d like to go from text on iA Writer and then with (hopefully) one click, I’d like to be able to save it in DTPO & DayOne. Any takers? Thanks!
