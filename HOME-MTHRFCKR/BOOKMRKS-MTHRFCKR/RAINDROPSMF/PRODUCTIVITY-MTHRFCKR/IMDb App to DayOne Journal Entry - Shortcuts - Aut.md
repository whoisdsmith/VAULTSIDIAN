description: Hi - I am sure I had previously seen / heard about a Shortcut that took an IMDb entry, and made it into a DayOne journal entry - But I can’t seem to find one that works anymore.  What I am trying to do is “check-in” on IMDb and have the film, date and (ideally) poster art, created in DayOne.  Can anyone help?  I am very new to all this Shortcuts stuff!
