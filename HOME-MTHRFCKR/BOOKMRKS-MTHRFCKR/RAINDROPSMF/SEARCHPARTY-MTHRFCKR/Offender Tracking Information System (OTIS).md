description: Welcome to the Michigan Department of Correctionsâ€™  	searchable database, which we call the Offender Tracking and Information System (OTIS).   	All of the records contained in OTIS are for prisoners and parolees who are CURRENTLY  	under the jurisdiction of the MDOC, as well as those serving a prison sentence but who  	are out on writ. Information about prisoners and parolees who have discharged from their  	sentences and who are not being currently supervised by, or under the jurisdiction of,  	the MDOC is not contained on OTIS.
