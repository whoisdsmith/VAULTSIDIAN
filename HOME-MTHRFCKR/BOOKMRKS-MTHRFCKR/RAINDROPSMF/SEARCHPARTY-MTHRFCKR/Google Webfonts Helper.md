description: Mnemosyne is your automated software development assistant.  It integrates with your IDE and works with you suggesting code, types, and tests as you work; and continually checking the consistency of your documentation, types, tests, and implementation â€” whether that means running test suites or type checkers, or using ML techniques to ensure your documentation matches your implementation. Mnemosyne applies statistical machine learning, formal methods, and Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) to enable developers to write higher quality, higher assurance, and more standards compliant code more quickly.  Mnemosyne transcends CI/CD by making live substantive contributions to the software development process as the developer works.
