# Socilab - LinkedIn Visualization

created: April 1, 2022 10:51 AM (UTC)
description: Socilab is a free tool that allows users to visualize and analyze their LinkedIn network. It works with the LinkedIn API to a) calculate structural hole metrics such as network density, hierarchy and constraint - and displays your percentile compared to other users of the tool, and b) display a dynamic/interactive visualization of your ego network with node coloring by industry and an option to enable/disable connections to self using D3.js. Users might find it useful for class tutorials. Former users of the now deprecated LinkedIn inMaps may find this to be a useful alternative.
