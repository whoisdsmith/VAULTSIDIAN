# Sphinx | Open Source Search Engine

created: December 23, 2021 4:12 AM (UTC)
description: Sphinx is an open source full text search server, designed with performance, relevance (search quality), and integration simplicity in mind. Sphinx lets you either batch index and search data stored in files, an SQL database, NoSQL storage -- or index and search data on the fly, working with Sphinx pretty much as with a database server.
