# Facebook Profile Id Grabber

created: March 31, 2022 9:20 PM (UTC)
description: Every Facebook account has whats known as a profile id which is unique for every account created on the platform. Some profiles show this more visibly than others though the browsers address bar depending if they have a personalised username set. If a username is set this will take president over the url address. Here are a few examples. https://www.facebook.com/zuck https://www.facebook.com/4 https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=4 Many websites have long been around which allow you to take a url such as https://www.facebook.com/zuck and get a response of 4. The idea around this chrome extension is to make the process more user friendly.
