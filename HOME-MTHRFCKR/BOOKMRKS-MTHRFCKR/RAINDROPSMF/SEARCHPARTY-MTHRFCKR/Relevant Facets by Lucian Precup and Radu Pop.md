description: In many contexts, facets are as important as the results themselves. While they are easy to handle when the data is structured and clean, they can be quite difficult to put in place on unstructured or low-quality data. This is particularly well seen in the context of e-commerce and marketplaces gathering several different vendors, but also in domains where data is heavily unstructured. With the arrival of voice assistants, chat-bots and other connected objects, displaying a list of results even very relevant as a first answer of the search engine is not an option. This talk is an exhaustive presentation around facets and how to make them relevant. Which facets to display and when, how to handle unstructured data, whatâ€™s the best user experience in each use case.

In short, how to make facets relevant again.
