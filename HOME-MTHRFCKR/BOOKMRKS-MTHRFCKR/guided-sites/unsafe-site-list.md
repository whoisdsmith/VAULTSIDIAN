## **Unsafe Site List:**

[igg-games.com](http://igg-games.com) / [pcgamestorrents.com](http://pcgamestorrents.com) / [gamestorrent.co](http://gamestorrent.co) The main reasons why igg-games is not recommended is due to their history of shady behavior, such as including their own form of DRM into their .dll files.  
BBRepacks - Fake BlackBox Repacks, contain malware.  
OceanOfGames - High malware risk.  
xGIROx - repacks contain bitcoin miners.  
Seyter - repacks contain bitcoin miners.  
[cracked-games.org](http://cracked-games.org) \- Malware Risk.  
crackingpatching - Malware Risk.  
Steamunlocked - Slow downloads, malicious link redirects & uploads stolen releases from other unsafe sites.  
The Pirate Bay - Malware Risk.  
Kickass Torrents - Malware Risk.  
Any website using the name of a Scene group (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA, etc.). Scene groups do not have public websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonators. (2 notable exceptions are <https://skidrowrepacks.com>, and <https://skidrowcodex.net>, which are fine to use, though they are still impostor sites).
