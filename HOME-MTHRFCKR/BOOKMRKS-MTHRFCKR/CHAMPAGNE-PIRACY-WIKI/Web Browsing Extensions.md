## Web Browsing Extensions

* * *

These are add-ons for your web browser which make your web experience ad-free, more private and streamlined.

We recommend [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

It is windows native, performs great and uses least amount of resources. Privacy in browsers is mostly marketing. The best privacy practice is to use good extensions and use your brain while surfing the web. Edge offers Sleeping Tabs, Startup Boost, Browser Sync, SmartScreen, Password Monitor, Tracking Prevention, Vertical Tabs, Collections, Web Capture, Immersive Reader and Automatic Coupon code finding during online checkout.

Alternate Browsers. Use these if you don't trust Microsoft with your data.
