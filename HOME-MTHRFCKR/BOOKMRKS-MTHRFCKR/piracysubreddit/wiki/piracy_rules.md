# /r/Piracy Rules







### 1. Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy

 * 1a. No low effort submissions such as sharing seeding ratio screenshots are permitted.
&nbsp;




### 2. No spam, trading, selling, or blatant self-promotion posts
 * 2a. No begging for invites to private sites, requesting for others to download content for you, requesting activation keys, etc.

 * 2c. Any monetary services are not allowed.

### 3. Do not request for specific pirated titles (ie. a specific movie, book title, software title, etc.); do not link to pirated content. [Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/subfaq)
 * 3a. You **may ask** generalized questions such as "Where can I find 4K movies, children's books, sci-fi books, etc.". You **may not** name a specific work's title in your content request.
 * 3b. Do not link to specific pirated media. You **may link** to the top level of a site, eg. https://1337x.to but **never** to a specific pirated release, eg. http://1337x.to/specific-movie-torrent
 * 3c. Do not encourage rule breaking by asking which specific title someone is looking for when they make a request

### 4. Redundant questions that have been previously answered will be removed
 * Do a custom search via google, example: `where to find cracked apps site:reddit.com/r/piracy`

&nbsp;




### 5. Do not direct-message moderators for help with your issues. Either message the mod team if relevant, or make a post on the sub as normal
 * Set the recipient as /r/piracy to message the mod team instead of direct-messaging a particular mod
