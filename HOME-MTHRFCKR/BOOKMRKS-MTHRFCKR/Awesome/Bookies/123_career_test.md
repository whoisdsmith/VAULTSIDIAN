# Career test result (2020)

In this test you had to choose between pictures showing specific work activities. Each picture depicted work associated with a specific type of personality. These types are derived from Dr. John Holland's theory of careers and vocational choice, known as Holland Codes.

There are six personality types in Holland's model:

* **Realistic:** practical, physical, concrete, hands-on, machine, and tool-oriented
* **Investigative:** analytical, intellectual, scientific, explorative, thinker
* **Artistic:** creative, original, independent, chaotic, inventive, media, graphics, and text
* **Social:** cooperative, supporting, helping, healing/nurturing, teaching
* **Enterprising:** competitive environments, leadership, persuading, status
* **Conventional:** detail-oriented, organizing, clerical

## Personality types and Holland Codes
Dr. Holland did not say that a person is just one of these types. Then there would be only six types of people in the world. Instead, any one person can have interests associated with all of the six types. When you rank the types, starting with those you have the most interest in to those you have the least interest in, you get your specific Holland Code.

There are some 720 different combinations possible, like ISERAC, AIRSEC, or CSERIA. Generally, however, only two or three letters are necessary to create a useful description, such as SC, IRC, or AIC. Such a description may apply to both a person and a work environment. By typifying both people and work environments with Holland Codes, we can calculate matches between them. This helps you assess a potential career or vocational choice.

## Your personality type
You preferred 'Realistic' the most, followed by 'Artistic' and 'Investigative'. Your six letter personality type is 'RAICSE'. Your personal preference is also shown in a graph below.

* Realistic : 25%
* Artistic : 20%
* Investigative : 18% 
* Conventional : 17%
* Social : 13%
* Enterprising : 7%

## Your personal Holland Code
Depending on how strongly you favor any specific type you can compose your own personal Holland Code. You do this by taking the first letters of the types you favor most. In your case, this is the letters R, A and I Your personal Holland Code then becomes either RAI, RA, AR or even ARI.
