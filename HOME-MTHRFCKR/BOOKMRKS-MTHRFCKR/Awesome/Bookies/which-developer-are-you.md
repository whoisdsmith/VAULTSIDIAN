You are humble and serve your team, but to do it best you want everyone to have clear processes and guidelines.
 
You help out with everything from collecting data regarding stories or released features, to improving code in code reviews and process documentation.
 
You will always push for additional clarity, because you genuinely believe that’s what the team needs, in all your rituals including backlog refinement.
 
Before you start a hobby project you’re likely to dig into the data and the need for your project, and you’ve avoided building many ideas thanks to that type of investigation alone.
