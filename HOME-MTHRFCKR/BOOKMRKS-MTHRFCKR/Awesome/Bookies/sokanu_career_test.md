## Morgan Wattiez's Personality Report
### Archetype
#### Enthusiasts
* Your strongest trait is **Investigative**, and your second strongest is **Artistic**, which makes you an Enthusiast.
* Enthusiasts are inquisitive and curious about things and like to solve problems in a methodical and rational way. They have the ability to express their ideas and concepts to others in an easy to understand and logical manner. They are also refreshingly open-minded and love to be inspired and motivated by different ideas and theories.

#### Skills You Can Focus On
Enthusiasts are independent, curious, and analytical. They are introspective people that naturally try to understand the world around them. Enthusiasts are thinkers, and they often like to read about things that interest them. They like to try things for themselves rather than take someone else's word for it. They are imaginative and they often like to conduct their own experiments in order to find out how something works.

#### Tendencies To Be Careful Of
Enthusiasts' aptitude for creative thinking and their desire to work at their own pace, conduct research, and think abstractly can sometimes stifle their ability to lead a team or work within a group people when they have a deadline. Their tendency to favor work that is more scientific or academic can also mean that they sometimes have difficulty following highly systematic or repetitive tasks like data entry or keeping track of small details.

### Your Working Style
You like analyzing information and using logic to address issues and problems. You likely prefer using creativity and alternative thinking to develop new ideas. You are inspired by tough problems, design, and the exploration of data or ideas. You are eager to take on new challenges or initiatives. You like setting goals, and then working persistently to achieve those goals. Your desire for excellence and persistence to see things through will serve you well in your professional life, but can be imposing on others in your personal and family life. It is helpful to sometimes step back and realize others may not naturally be driven by the same factors as you.

#### Strengths
* You don't typically need other people to keep you motivated. Most likely, you have no problem working from home, giving you greater flexibility for structuring your time.
* You see the best in your friends and coworkers and try to make them feel comfortable and valuable. You trust people's motives and generally empathize with people.

### Watch Out For
* The constant desire to set future goals can get in the way of appreciating past and present successes. You should take the time to enjoy your achievements.
* Your easy going approach to work and life can be perceived as thoughtless, inconsiderate, or lazy by some. Be wary of making little slip ups like spelling mistakes in your work or missed appointments in your personal life that might unfairly impact people's perception of you.
* You are motivated to please those around you but are not particularly dependable. As a result, others might view you as likeable, but unreliable.
* You might like to think things through before you try them. This means that your decisions are usually sound ones, but it also means you might spend a lot of mental energy on things that might not matter.
* Be wary of self-interested or manipulative people. You are so quick to accommodate others that you may let them take advantage of you. Remember to assert your own needs as well as others', and make sure your voice gets heard too.

### Team Interaction
* Extrinsic performance goals will tend to undermine your intrinsic motivation for self improvement and mastery. It is important you work with supportive supervisors who can nurture, as opposed to abuse, your natural motivation.
* You may feel strained after spending too much time working within a group. You probably do not like having to contribute as much as you like to listen, which means your voice can sometimes go unheard. You are certainly capable of expressing yourself to others, but you may find the experience mentally draining.
* You are a supportive team player. If you are in a leadership position, your desire to please everyone makes your employees feel respected and valued. However, you may find that you are a more effective arbitrator than a leader, and thrive in situations where decisions are made as a team, rather than by a single person.

### Personal Style
* You prefer to avoid too much planning in your life, preferring to go with the flow, seizing ideas and opportunities as they come to you.
* You tend to go about life one thing at a time, preferring to keep things simple whenever possible. Having to switch back and forth between tasks while you work, or between people during conversation, may be challenging for you. You may prefer listening than talking, staying in to going out, or doing something you know you love to trying something new.
* You likely naturally have a sense for people when you meet them. How is each person feeling? What are they talking about? Who is in charge? You may only feel comfortable in a group after you understand the people in it.

### Ideal Work Environment
* You thrive in environments with flexible guidelines that encourage you to work on projects with less constrained outcomes or requirements.
* It is important to at least have the option to work in a quiet, isolated environment for you to stay productive when you need it.
* You will excel when working with good-hearted people who value cooperation and harmony.

### Values
* You value personal rituals. Maybe you take an extra half hour every morning to enjoy a quiet coffee before starting your day, or perhaps you have a favourite TV show you watch each evening after work. Whatever form they might take, these routines save you energy and restore you, especially when you feel burned out or anxious.
* You value helping other people without the expectation of reciprocity. Not being particularly motivated by personal achievement, you seek opportunities to create value for others or your environment.
* You likely don't have particularly engrained political or philosophical leanings and can appreciate both conservative and liberal arguments.

### Skills
* You are inquisitive and curious and like to solve problems. 
* You are refreshingly open-minded and love to be inspired and motivated by different ideas and theories.

### Broad Personality
Your personality is comprised of several factors ranging from how ambitious you are to how conscientious you are. Below is your personality condensed into a set of high-level traits.
* Agreeableness : 76
  * Agreeableness is the value which you place on ensuring that everyone gets along. Someone with a high agreeableness score will be more likely to try and understand the needs of other people, and looks for ways to ensure that everyone is satisfied; the downside of this being that their own needs and wants may be given a low priority.
  * You're more agreable than 89% of the world
* Openness : 72
  * Do you find yourself searching for new ideas? Do you enjoy talking about big, abstract ideas? If so, you may have a high openness to experience score. Some common traits of a high openness score include a desire for variety, high curiosity, and an active imagination.

* Social Responsibility : 56
  * Social responsibility measures a person's desire to see fair outcomes and their general concern for the welfare of others. People who score high on this trait value equality and are generally not particularly experience-seeking.
* Conscientiousness : 52
  * Conscientiousness is one's ability to master our impulses and act on a schedule. Individuals with a high conscientiousness score will find it easier to ignore urges and plan in advance; this also means they may have a difficult time with spontaneous or unexpected situations.
* Emotional Stability : 42

  * While most people associate extroversion with a love of other people, the reality is that this trait covers a much broader range of situations. A high extroversion level means that an individual need external stimulus to be happy; this can mean surrounding themselves with others or trying new experiences. Introverts tend to be able to satisfy themselves from within, and are therefore usually far more independent than extroverts.
