However, this mechanism is not so good for pages that are optimized for narrow screens using media queries. To mitigate this problem, Apple introduced the "viewport meta tag" in Safari iOS to let web developers control the viewport's size and scale.

A typical mobile-optimized site contains something like the following:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
```

- `width`: Controls the size of the viewport.
- `initial-scale`: Controls the zoom level when the page is first loaded.
- `maximum-scale`: Control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
- `minimum-scale`: Control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.
- `user-scalable`: Control how users are allowed to zoom the page in or out.

### Mobile Optimization: Prevent Mobile Browser Pan and Zoom

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no" />
```

### Final Viewport

```html
<meta
  name="viewport"
  content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, user-scalable=no"
/>
```

## shrink-to-fit=no

It is Safari specific, at least at time of writing, being introduced in Safari 9.0. From the "What's new in Safari?" documentation for Safari 9.0:

Viewport Changes  
Viewport meta tags using "width=device-width" cause the page to scale down to fit content that overflows the viewport bounds. You can override this behavior by adding "shrink-to-fit=no" to your meta tag as shown below. The added value will prevent the page from scaling to fit the viewport.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, shrink-to-fit=no">

In short, adding this to the viewport meta tag restores pre-Safari 9.0 behaviour.
