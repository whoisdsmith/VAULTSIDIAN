  For example, you can use convert binary to optimize your JPEG images with the following command (parameters inside brackets are optional):

`convert INPUT.jpg -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip [-resize WxH] [-quality N] [-interlace JPEG] [-colorspace Gray/sRGB] OUTPUT.jpg`

- language tags
  - [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation): There are multiple language tag systems available for language codification. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) specifies both twoand three-letter codes to represent languages in standards ISO 639-1 and ISO 639-2, respectively.

### Country Code

- [ISO](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/)
- [ISO-3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) country codes
- [Emoji flag symbols](https://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/iso3166)

### SEO

- [fetch and render in google webmaster tools not working](https://github.com/prerender/prerender/issues/120#issuecomment-305216710)  
  The crawlers do access the `_escaped_fragment_` URLs, but Fetch as Google has a bug where they don't. So you have to manually enter the `?_escaped_fragment_=` query parameter when using Fetch as Google, but the normal Googlebot does not have that issue.

### Networking

#### HTTP

- xhr
- Content-Type
  - MIME type
    - Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type
      - type/subtype
      - case-insensitive but traditionally is written all in lower case
      - Discrete types
      - Multipart types

#### CORS

- XMLHttpRequest
  - withCredentials: for enabling cookie setting

## Testing

### Framework

- mocha
- jest

### Assertion Library

- Chai

### Mocking Framework

- Sinon

### Redux

#### Actions Creator

- The most painful point: need to write tons of actions manually! So try some lib to auto-generate those.
- redux-actions: not that usefult
- [redux-saga-routines](https://github.com/afitiskin/redux-saga-routines)

#### Async / Side Effect Handler

- redux-thunk: basic and simple one
- [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga): easy to write test

## Form

### Design Pattern

- Leverage html form
- Make sure to do e.preventDefault() while using onSubmit of form in SPA
- Leverage a visibility hidden button for click to submit feature
- Better to have self-hosted state (two ways data binding?)
- Better to have self-hosted validation (base on self-hosted state)
- Better to have field-based composable form structure
- Better to leverage `autofocus` of the first input
- Better to auto open the options while the select is focused

### Modal Form

- Autofocus
- Would be a bit tricky while the form is in the modal (the dom may not be rendered?)
- Make sure to destory the DOM of the form so that autofocus works every time the modal is toggled

### Input

[text-mask](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask)

## Keyboard Shortcut

### Why Keyboard Shortcut

- Convenient for desktop device
- Useless for mobile and laptop device

### Design Pattern

- Make sure to disable shortcut while input is in focus.
- Better to have a tooltip for hint, or to have a dedicated shortcut page, section, etc.

# React

## HOC, Higher Order Component

### Decorator

babel 6

```sh
yarn add babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy

// .babelrc
{
  "plugins": ["transform-decorators-legacy"]
}
```

```js
@withRouter
@connect()
class ComponentWithHOC extend React.Component {}
```
