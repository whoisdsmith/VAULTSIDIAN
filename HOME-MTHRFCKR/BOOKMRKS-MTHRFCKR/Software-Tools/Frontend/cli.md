## Uninstalling

Uninstalling  
To uninstall the AWS CLI version 2, run the following commands, substituting the paths you used to install.

Find the folder that contains the symlinks to the main program and the completer.

```
$ which aws
/usr/local/bin/aws
```

Use that information to find the installation folder that the symlinks point to.

```
$ ls -l /usr/local/bin/aws
lrwxrwxrwx 1 ec2-user ec2-user 49 Oct 22 09:49 /usr/local/bin/aws -> /usr/local/aws-cli/aws
```

Now delete the two symlinks in the first folder. If your user account already has write permission to these folders, you don't need to use sudo.

```
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/aws_completer
```

Finally, you can delete the main installation folder. Use sudo to gain write access to the /usr/local folder.

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/aws-cli
```
