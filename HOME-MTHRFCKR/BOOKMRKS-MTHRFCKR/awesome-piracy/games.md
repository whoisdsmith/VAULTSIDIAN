# GAMES

‚ö†Ô∏è **Use an adblocker like uBlock Origin before visiting any of the linked sites.**

‚ö†Ô∏è First and foremost, stay away from The Pirate Bay. Reason: malware-filled shithole. Read the section at the bottom for more info.

&nbsp;

## ‚ñ∫ Introduction

- Check the [FAQ page](https://old.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq#wiki_.25BA_games) for some frequently-asked game-related questions

- **EMPRESS** releases to 1337x

- The sites described below as having **Scene releases** will contain releases from the Scene groups **CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA**, etc. [What is "The Scene"?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/32isgo/noobpirate_what_is_a_scene_cracktorrent/)

- The sites labeled **REPACKS** are for releases that have been repacked from the original (pirated) release (whether it is a Scene, P2P, or GOG release). The intent of a repack is to provide one-click, pre-cracked installations as well as smaller filesizes, and in many cases, also provide DLCs included in the installation as an All-In-One package. Not to be confused with [The Scene's definition of REPACK](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/9r54lr/what_does_proper_and_repack_mean/)

- To check if a game has been cracked by the Scene, jump to the [Scene Tracer section on the Megathread's Tools page](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/tools#wiki_.25BA_scene_.2F_p2p_tracer_websites). For a general overview of Scene game releases: <https://predb.ovh/?q=%40cat%20games>

- Cracked game downloads will always have a readme `*.txt` or `*.nfo` file containing instructions. If you need further assistance, visit /r/CrackSupport

- For more news of game releases (Scene as well as P2P), visit /r/CrackWatch. For more subreddits, such as Console hacking, ROM piracy, etc, visit the [Related Subreddits page](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/megathread/related_subreddits)

## ‚ñ∫ Relevant Software/Tools

**Download Managers**

> These are useful for DDL sites. Download managers such as these are meant to help to speed up downloads, typically by increasing the number of connections to the server or attempting to split the download into chunks. They are also especially handy when grabbing multiple links at once, which is typical with DDL sites, where they'll split up large downloads into multiple small `.rar` parts, as well as bypassing captchas and eliminating the risks of clicking on the wrong download button on various file hosts. They also help with resuming paused or timed out downloads which your browser may not be able to do in some cases.

- [JDownloader2](http://jdownloader.org/jdownloader2) - Download manager that supports downloading from a variety of file-hosts. Supports downloading video from many websites.

## ‚ñ∫ Do Not Use ‚ö†Ô∏è

Untrusted sites, release groups & repackers

- **The Pirate Bay / TPB** - Do not use the pirate bay or any of its mirrors to download games/software. High malware risk, [even from skulled users](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/cxbn33/psa_ransomware_all_current_vegas_pro_17_torrents/)

- **Kickass Torrents / KAT** - Kat went down in 2016. Don't rely on any supposed mirrors floating around.

- **BBRepacks** - BlackBox Repacks impersonator. [Malware in the Doom Eternal repack posted on TPB and 1337x](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/fmgyf6/doom_eternal_repack_contains_malware/)

- **Qoob / Seyter** - Qoob is the name that Seyter switched to after having been caught adding a [bitcoin miner to his JC3 repack](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackStatus/comments/4x0nt1/jc3_xl_seyter_has_bitcoin_miner/). More [info on Qoob](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/a78tvj/qoob_stopped_repacking/ec18n6f/)

- **CorePack** - Malware in a long list of their releases. [Some background](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/8wp2fa/there_are_malwares_inside_fear_3_corepack_releases/). Their [official statement](https://old.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/8wuyyk/our_sincere_apologies_to_everyone_corepack/)

- **Ocean Of Games** - [Malware risk](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/8yjv8e/do_not_use_ocean_of_games/) and past history of coin miners included in their installers

- **NosTEAM** - Shitty blog site with shoddy ads. Torrent downloads are handled by an intermediary ~3 MiB executable file: the epitome of shady behavior.

- **igg-games.com / pcgamestorrents.com / gamestorrent.co** - These are not recommended on this subreddit as trusted sites for various reasons, but the main reasons why igg-games is not recommended is due to their history of shady behavior, such as including their own [form of DRM into their .dll files](https://reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/c7356i/igg_infecting_their_downloads_with_their_selfmade/), another [one](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/afctdw/once_again_with_the_pirated_release_of_the/) (some [extra background info](https://reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/gv6zmu/why_igg_games_seems_hated/)), and overall [dickish behavior by the owner/admins](https://reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/apcvx4/here_we_go_again_igg_this_time_im_not_reporting/).

- Any website using the name of a Scene group (such as CODEX, CPY, SKIDROW, HOODLUM, RELOADED, SiMPLEX, DARKSiDERS, PLAZA, etc.). Scene groups do not have public websites. If you find a site using the name of a scene group, they are impersonators. Beware of these sites as they tend to package their releases with malware (3 notable exceptions are skidrowreloaded.com, skidrowrepacks.com, and skidrowcodex.net, which are fine to use, though they are still impostor sites). [What is "The Scene"?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/32isgo/noobpirate_what_is_a_scene_cracktorrent/)

- Any site you find on Google by searching for "free game downloads", "cracked games", etc. Google de-lists piracy websites from its search results, which means that fake / impostor / malware-spreading sites will float to the top of the search results.

- Any "cracked games" site or download you find on Youtube

- Any aggregator site like snowfl or DHT crawler like btdb, btdig, etc. Not because the sites intend to infect you with malware, but because their intent is to aggregate as many publicly available torrents as possible into one place. This can include torrents that have been posted to TPB or otherwise spread publicly via the DHT network. You should only grab games from sites that take a personal hand in adding content (excludes sites that auto-post scene releases, in which case they would need to be vetted to make sure that their posts are real scene releases) rather than automatically aggregating from hundreds of unknown sites.
