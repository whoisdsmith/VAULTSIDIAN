It was released on May 18, 2011. Set `net.discoverable` to False in settings and disable the Web GUI to mitigate security vulnerabilities that were later discovered. You can grab the installer from the wayback machine, as it has it cached. Just navigate to a close date past the release date noted earlier. You can check which version you have downloaded by checking the file's properties, in the details tab.

## ► Download Managers

> These are useful for DDL sites. Download managers such as these are meant to help to speed up downloads, typically by increasing the number of connections to the server or attempting to split the download into chunks. They are also especially handy when grabbing multiple links at once, which is typical with DDL sites, where they'll split up large downloads into multiple small `.rar` parts, as well as bypassing captchas and eliminating the risks of clicking on the wrong download button on various file hosts. They also help with resuming paused or timed out downloads which your browser may not be able to do in some cases.

## ► Download Services

> Some DDL sites may only offer downloads through premium links, meaning the download will be available through a file host which would lock the download unless you paid a subscription to said file host. The prices can be a bit extravagant, especially when you consider that many DDL sites may use different file hosts, so it would not be feasible to pay for multiple of those subscriptions.

* [seedr.cc](https://www.seedr.cc/) - Free seedbox that allows you to download torrents up to 2 GiB in size. If you wish to go premium, avoid buying from seedr - they are way overpriced. Just check /r/seedboxes for alternative paid seedboxes.
