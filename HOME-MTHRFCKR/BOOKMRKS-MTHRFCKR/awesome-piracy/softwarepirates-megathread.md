# SOFTWAREPIRATES MEGATHREAD

\## Welcome to the \[r/SoftwarePirates\](https://reddit.com/r/SoftwarePirates) Megathread!

This megathread contains a list of tools, software, sites, etc. for Software Piracy. This will be updated every now and then so be sure to check once in a while.

## \*\*INFO\*\*

\[What are scene releases or Cracks?\](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackWatch/comments/92uz49/the\_warez\_scene\_how\_it\_works/)  
\[What are Torrents?\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent)

\*\*For Non-English sites, use Google Translate or \[MATE Translate\](https://gikken.co/mate-translate) to view them in English or another language.\*\*

\*\*Sometimes, your ISP can spy on your web browsing activity when going onto piracy sites (despite the chance of this being slim). To prevent this, use a DNS that your ISP doesn't use. We recommend \[AdGuard DNS\](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html) and \[Quad9\](https://www.quad9.net).\*\*

\*\*If a site is blocked or you can't access it, it can caused by your ISP or DNS Blocking the site. This can be fixed by using a DNS, Proxy, or a VPN.  
Another tool you can use is Unblockit-PW. Just use the sites listed on the megathread there and stay away from unsafe or untrusted sites.\*\*
