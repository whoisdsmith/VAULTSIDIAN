## FAQ

> What happened to the GitHub repo?

GitHub randomly decided to suspend my account and didn't even let me backup the repos. I recovered the repo from one of the forks.

> Why was this even created?

Research purposes... :wink:

> How can I suggest a new item?

Create a new pull request on the GitLab repo. Make sure to check if the item already exists. Don't suggest any random site you found or you are associated with, add resson why you'd like the link to be added.
