## Result (2015) : PLSC

**P : You’re a Planner.**
You may be slow, but you’ll usually find the best solution. If something’s worth
doing, it’s worth doing right.

**L : You like coding at a Low level.**
You’re from the old school of programming and believe that you should have an
intimate relationship with the computer. You don’t mind juggling registers
around and spending hours getting a 5% performance increase in an algorithm.

**S : You work best in a Solo situation.**
The best way to program is by yourself. There’s no communication problems, you
know every part of the code allowing you to write the best programs possible.

**C : You are a Conservative programmer.**
The less code you write, the less chance there is of it containing a bug. You
write short and to the point code that gets the job done efficiently.
