**The Architect ("INTJ")**
"I'm the Architect. I am always looking at the blueprint of any situation, and if something isn't working I will find the most efficient and logical way to fix it. I don't mind working long hours on my own to get the best result; then there's no one to distract or argue with me. Just accept that I have the perfect solution and we'll get along fine."

INTJs love logical analysis and strategising; give them a complex theory or problem and they will relish finding the most effective and innovative solution. They always have the big picture in mind, and strive to improve systems and bring about change for the better. They work hard, to an incredibly high standard. Often known as "lone wolves", INTJs dislike distractions and inefficiency, so are best working alone or in a small team. Famous INTJs include Mark Zuckerberg and Avril Lavigne.

## INTJ Strengths

### Hardworking

INTJs will put in the hard yards to see an idea through to completion. They will work long hours and look for ways to make the task completion more efficient if it means the end goal is achieved.

### Strategic and imaginative

With a bird's eye view on whatever they're working on, INTJs can see a problem from many different angles, and are able to develop solutions for multiple scenarios that may arise.

### Confident

If an INTJ has come to a conclusion based on logic, there is no doubt in their mind that it is correct. An INTJ will not be swayed by authority or convention if it goes against their own rational finding.

### Open-minded

INTJs are open to new ideas that are backed up by logic, even if they go against the INTJ's previous conceptions. However, once their mind is made up, it can be difficult to change it.

### Jack-of-all-trades

INTJs can accomplish almost anything they set their minds to, thanks to their imagination, determination, confidence and strategic thinking.

## INTJ Weaknesses

### Dislike highly structured environments

Because they are working to develop logical, efficient and innovative systems, INTJs will not get along with people who like to blindly follow rules and conventions just to maintain the status quo.

### Overly analytical

If they encounter a situation where logic doesn't rule, the INTJ will not hesitate to point out any flaws. Interpersonal relationships can be challenging, as the INTJ focuses on ideas, not personal connections, and will not sugar coat criticism.

### Arrogant

INTJs are confident that their way is the best way - which is why they love to work alone. This can cause friction if they are working in a team environment and they may need to work on ways to communicate without alienating others.

### Judgmental

INTJs tend to dismiss emotional and historical factors in a situation, focusing on the rational argument instead. They are so confident their thought process is correct that it can be difficult for them to consider any ideas not based on rational thought.

### Withdrawn

INTJs may seem aloof and reserved as they spend so much time in their own minds. They tend not to be overly demonstrative with their emotions and are unlikely to provide much encouragement or support to others.

## What INTJs look for in a career

### Professional competence

INTJs have high standards for their own work and expect their colleagues to likewise be intelligent, productive and competent.

### Autonomy

INTJs prefer roles where they are able to focus and are not frequently interrupted by others.

### Influence

INTJs don't seek the spotlight, but they like to be able to control things behind the scenes.

### Challenge

Low-level menial tasks will not engage an INTJ; they need something complex to sink their teeth into.

### Logic

INTJs enjoy a well-structured work environment based on logic and efficiency, where they are able to problem-solve and improve systems.
