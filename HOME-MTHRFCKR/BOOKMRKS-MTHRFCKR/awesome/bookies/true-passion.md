## Result (2020)

**Your core values centre on kindness and compassion**

You believe in going the extra mile – or even 26.2 miles for a charity marathon – to make the world a better place. It may be something that has always been important to you, or something that has grown in recent years, but you’re convinced that the power of kindness can improve relationships and life in general, both locally and globally. You may already have found yourself drawn to working in a caring profession, such as social services, nursing or counselling. But your values can also be expressed in other professions. Living compassionately often goes hand-in-hand with a well-developed sense of empathy, and you may find it easy to step into another person’s shoes. This can be expressed in many aspects of the corporate world, in jobs that rely on building trust and good relationships with clients. If your job is at odds with this core value, seek to nurture it outside the office, perhaps in voluntary work.
