V**ersion control is one of the top skills you must master.** It does not matter at all if you are a web developer, mobile developer, data scientist or whatever. You will use git every day. And if you do not understand how it works, you are going to have a bad time.

Many people just learn the basic commands. Other people never use the command line at all. In my mind, this is like using a calculator without understanding what multiplication is.

Here are great resources for you to reach the next level in git.

## General resources

-   📺 [Git Tutorial for Beginners: Learn Git in 1 Hour.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) If you want to _brush up the basics_, invest one hour and watch this video. But don’t forget to open a terminal and follow along!
-   📄 📺 [Version control with git (Udacity).](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) If you are a _complete beginner,_ this four-hour course might be the best way to start. It is a mix of (partly cheesy) videos and a written tutorial.
-   📄 [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) is probably **the most comprehensive source.** It gives you access to the book “Pro Git”. The book has 440 pages in the print version. Now the good thing: you can read it online. For free. The git command reference is even better. If you think you understood `git rebase` , read this [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) and think again!

## Tricks and best practices

-   📄 [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) It is easy to mess up with git. And sometimes you do not even know what’s wrong. _Oh Shit, Git!?!_ provides recipes for those cases.
-   📄 [Git commit message style guide.](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/index.html) The style guide is written for Udacity’s nano degree program, but it generally applies. If you like the approach, check out [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli), a command-line tool helping you to write better commit messages.
-   📄 [On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git.](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html) _If you need to undo something in git, refer to this site._ They designed it like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book to guide you to the correct solution.
-   📄 [git-tips.](https://github.com/git-tips/tips) This repository contains snippets with a brief description. It is great if you forgot again how to remove all branches which were already merged to `main` .
-   📄 [GitLab’s tips and tricks](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/12/08/git-tips-and-tricks/). A superb collection of best practices. For example, it shows you the power of git aliases.

## Git internals

-   📺 [Knowledge is Power: Getting out of trouble by understanding Git by Steve Smith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sevc6668cQ0) is a great talk about how git works under the hood. _If you just going to watch one talk, watch this._ The talk explains the internal model of git. For example, you will learn what a commit looks like on your hard drive.

[Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8).

-   📺 [Tech Talk: Linus Torvalds on git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpnKHJAok8). Linus gave this talk about two years he developed git. If you ever wondered why git “happened” in first place, watch this talk.
-   📄 [Deconstructing a git commit.](https://krishnabiradar.com/blogs/deconstructing-a-git-commit/) A great blog post looking into what a commit really is.

**A solid understanding of git will help you every day. Now go on, go learn!**
