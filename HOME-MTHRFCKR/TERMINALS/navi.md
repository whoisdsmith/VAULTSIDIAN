# navi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denisidoro/navi/master/assets/icon.png" alt="icon" height="28px"/> [![Actions Status](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi/actions) ![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/denisidoro/navi?include_prereleases)

An interactive cheatsheet tool for the command-line.

[![Demo](https://asciinema.org/a/406461.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/406461)

**navi** allows you to browse through cheatsheets (that you may write yourself or download from maintainers) and execute commands. Suggested values for arguments are dynamically displayed in a list.

## Pros

- it will spare you from knowing CLIs by heart

- it will spare you from copy-pasting output from intermediate commands

- it will make you type less

- it will teach you new one-liners

It uses [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [skim](https://github.com/lotabout/skim), or [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) under the hood and it can be either used as a command or as a shell widget (_Ã  la_ Ctrl-R).

## Trying out online

If you don't have access to a Unix shell at the moment and you want to live preview **navi**, head to [this playground](https://www.katacoda.com/denisidoro/scenarios/navi). It'll start a docker container with instructions for you to install and use the tool. Note: login required.

## Similar tools

There are many similar projects out there ([beavr](https://github.com/denisidoro/beavr), [bro](https://github.com/hubsmoke/bro), [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat), [cheat.sh](https://github.com/chubin/cheat.sh), [cmdmenu](https://github.com/amacfie/cmdmenu), [eg](https://github.com/srsudar/eg), [how2](https://github.com/santinic/how2), [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi) and [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr), to name a few).

They are excellent projects, but **navi** remains unique in the following ways:

- it's natural to write cheatsheets tailored to your needs

- arguments are neither hardcoded nor a simple template
