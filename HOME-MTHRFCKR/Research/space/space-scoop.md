Space Words

[Antimatter Antimatter is made up of tiny particles that are the opposite of normal material. When matter meets its antimatter equal they are both destroyed, releasing lots of energy.](http://www.spacescoop.org/en/words/antimatter/) 

[Asteroid Asteroids are chunks of rock and metal left over from when our Solar System formed. Most can be found between Mars and Jupiter, a region of space we call the Asteroid Belt.](http://www.spacescoop.org/en/words/asteroid/)

[Asteroid Belt The asteroid belt is a region of our Solar System between Mars and Jupiter. It is heavily populated by asteroids and dwarf planets.](http://www.spacescoop.org/en/words/asteroid-belt/)
