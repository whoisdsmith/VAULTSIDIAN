# Long-Tenn Cardiovascular Effects of Mixed Amphetam

Academic Supplement Long-Tenn Cardiovascular Effects of Mixed Amphetamine Salts Extended Release in Adults With ADHD By Richard H. Weisler, MD, Joseph Biederman, MD, Thomas J. Spencer, MD, and Timothy E. Wilens, MD

FOCUS POINTS_____________________________ • Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic neurobehavioral condition that can persist into adulthood. • Psychostimulants are recommended as first-line pharmacologic agents for ADHD symptom management in children and adults. • Psychostimulants such as methylphenidate and mixed amphetamine salts exert sympathomimetic effects that can lead to changes in cardiovascular parameters. • Although psychostimulant-induced cardiovascular changes are generally not clinically significant in pediatric patients, little is known about the cardiovascular effects of such agents in adults. • In this study, most adults with ADHD (in whom major medical illness and cardiovascular morbidity are absent) given up to 24 months of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (MAS XR) 20-60 mg/day exhibited small and clinically insignificant average changes in cardiovascular parameters. • The small number of cases with borderline blood pressure or pulse measures at baseline who experienced clinically significant increases in such values with MAS XR therapy highlights the importance of evaluating blood pressure and pulse at baseline and periodically during therapy so that treatment regimen can be adjusted in a timely manner. ABSTRACT______________________________ Objective: To assess long-term cardiovascular effects of mixed amphetamine salts extended release (MAS XR) in adults with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) combined subtype. Methods: 223 otherwise healthy adults (>18 years of age) with ADHD combined subtype were exposed to s24 months of MAS XR (20—60 mg/day). Resting sitting diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse were measured at baseline and weekly, then monthly during long-term treatment. Twelve-lead  
electrocardiograms were obtained at screening/baseline, weekly, then at 3and 6-month intervals up to 24 months. Findings: With MAS XR 20-60 mg/day, mean changes in DBP (1.3±9.2 mm Hg; P=.O42), SBP (2.3±12.5 mm Hg; P=.006), and pulse (2.1±13.4 bpm; P=,019) were small and not clinically significant. A clinically insignificant increase in QTcB (corrected by Bazett’s formula) interval (7.2 msec; Pc.OOl) was observed at 24 months. No subject exhibited QTcB interval >480 msec (QTcF [corrected by Fridericias formula] >454 msec). Seven subjects discontinued due to a cardiovascular adverse event (hypertension, n-5, palpitation/tachycardia, n=2); none of these events was reported as serious. Few subjects with normal baseline vital signs (using approved parameters at the time of study initiation) exhibited clinically significant abnormalities at end point; several subjects with borderline baseline values exhibited shifts to abnormal values during MAS XR therapy. Conclusion: Cardiovascular effects of long-term MAS XR (<60 mg/day) were minimal in otherwise healthy adults with ADHD. Nevertheless, vital signs should be monitored prior to and during treatment with any stimulant. CNS Spectr. 2005; 10(12 Suppl 20):35-43 INTRODUCTION______________________________ Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the more prevalent chronic health conditions encountered in pediatrics, 1,2 with as many as 2% to 18% of community school-age children estimated to be affected. 1 An estimated 30% to 65% of patients continue to experience symptoms into adulthood. 3 ' 5 Awareness of adult ADHD is growing and has raised the need to define effective and well-tolerated treatment options. Currently, psychostimulants such as amphetamines or methylphenidate (MPH) constitute first-line pharmacologic treatment of ADHD in pediatric and adult cases. 6 Efficacy in adults with immediate-release (IR) and extended-release (XR) formulations of MPH and mixed amphetamine salts

(MAS) appears to be comparable to that seen in children with ADHD. 710 Stimulants have sympathomimetic effects that can result in increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and pulse rate at therapeutic doses. However, such changes with IR amphetamine and MPH formulations in children and adolescents are, in general, clinically unremarkable. 1112 A scientific statement released by the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended determining heart rate and blood pressure (BP) at baseline and on follow-up visits for children or adolescents receiving IR stimulant medications; however, the guidelines made no specific recommendations for electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring with stimulant therapy. 13 The potential for harmful cardiovascular effects of stimulant use in children and adults has also been highlighted by recent regulatory actions in the United States and Canada. In 2004, a warning label was placed on MAS XR stating that amphetamine misuse or use by patients with underlying structural cardiac abnormalities may cause sudden death or serious cardiovascular events. During 2005, Health Canada briefly removed then reinstated MAS XR in the Canadian marketplace. The actions of Health Canada prompted a US Food and Drug Administration re-review of the postmarketing data and the FDA panel concluded that the rate of sudden death in 12 pediatric patients treated with MAS XR did not exceed the number that would be expected to occur in children (1-20 years of age) even without amphetamine treatment (~3.3 in 100,000 annually). The FDA panel further found that all of the postmarketing cases in question were marked by underlying structural cardiac abnormalities, preexisting cardiovascular disease, a family history of ventricular tachycardia, or unusual cardiovascular stress, or drug misuse. The panel recommended no further regulatory action; subsequently, in August 2005, Health Canada reinstated the use of MAS XR throughout the Canadian market. These cases highlight the fact that cardiovascular disease or its history often goes undetected or noted by currently treating physicians; in adults for instance it has been estimated that -1.7% to 8.8% of cases with evidence of ischemic heart disease go unrecognized. 14 They also highlight the timeliness and importance of the AHA recommendations to obtain careful patient and family histories regarding cardiovascular conditions in patients receiving any type of psychostimulant therapy. The cardiovascular effects of stimulant therapy in adults with ADHD are less well characterized but  
appear to be similar in magnitude to those changes seen in pediatric patients. 7,8 While this is encouraging, much more research is required to fully characterize the cardiovascular changes and potential risks of stimulant therapy in adults with ADHD. Such patients may be more vulnerable to changes in BP and pulse not only due to their increasing age (typically between ages 35 and 40), but also due to the potential presence of medical comorbidities, such as essential hypertension and arteriosclerosis, that may go undetected even during careful screening. Very limited research has been conducted on the cardiovascular effects of XR stimulant formulations. In a 1-year study of treatment with a long-acting, osmotic-release formulation of MPH (18-54 mg/ day) in children with ADHD, sustained improvements in ADHD symptoms were not accompanied by any clinically meaningful changes in BP or pulse (<4 mm Hg and <4 beats per minute [bpm], respectively). 15 MAS XR has been formulated for oncedaily dosing via the inclusion of immediate-release and delayed-release pellets, 16 with therapeutic effects persisting for up to 12 hours. 17 In an earlier report from a short-term, multicenter, double-blind, forced-dose-escalation study in adults with ADHD, MAS XR exhibited a safety profile similar to that reported in pediatric studies. 10 Herein, we present cardiovascular assessments obtained among subjects who participated in the short-term study and a 24-month, open-label extension of that study. METHODS_______________________________ The cardiovascular safety of MAS XR in the management of adults with ADHD was examined in two phases: a 4-week, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, forceddose-escalation study of MAS XR 20, 40, and 60 mg/day 10 and a 24-month open-label extension study. Subjects Subjects were male orfemale, al 8 years of age, diagnosed with ADHD based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition-Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) 18 criteria for ADHD combined type, and thought to be in good physical health at short-term study entry. Excluded were subjects with a history of or ongoing cardiovascular disease, including history of coronary artery disease, angina pectoris, or other coronary artery disease variant; myocardial infarction; bypass surgery; angioplasty; or any clinically or electrocardiographically significant cardiac or vascular abnormality.

Long-Term Cardiovascular Effects of MAS XR in Adults With ADHD

a requirement for concomitant medications that could affect heart rate, BP, or the central nervous system also were exclusionary. It should be noted that the blood pressure and pulse thresholds used for subject selection, while higher than what is considered normal among physicians today, were in line with AHA guidelines when this study was designed and implemented. Subthreshold anxiety or depressive symptoms were not exclusionary, but subjects with comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (eg, psychosis; bipolar disorders; pervasive developmental disorder; severe obsessivecompulsive, depressive, or anxiety disorders; history of suspected substance abuse or dependence disorder [excluding nicotine] according to DSM-IV-TR criteria) were not eligible to participate. To be eligible for the extension study, subjects were required to have completed at least 1 week of double-blind treatment in the short-term study without experiencing any clinically important adverse events that would preclude continued exposure to MAS XR. Institutional review boards at each participating research site approved all study procedures and informed consent forms. All subjects voluntarily signed the informed consent form. Study Visits and Dosing The studies were designed to test the safety and efficacy of MAS XR administered once daily at doses ranging from 20 to 60 mg in adults with ADHD. During the initial 4-week study, subjects were randomly assigned to receive MAS XR 20, 40, or 60 mg/day in a forced-dose-escalation manner. Study visits occurred at baseline and weekly during this time. During the open-label extension study, visits occurred weekly for the first 4 weeks to assess safety and tolerance, and to adjust dose levels if necessary. Thereafter, visits occurred at monthly intervals for up to 24 months. For the first week of the open-label extension study, all subjects initiated MAS XR treatment at 20 mg/day, regardless of final dose in the doubleblind study. During the first month of the extension, the study dose could be increased by the investigator in 20-mg increments up to 40 or 60 mg/day at the weekly visits. Doses could be increased by a 20mg increment at the month 2 visit and increased or decreased by 20-mg increments at subsequent monthly visits based on the investigator’s judgment of optimal dose. Optimal dose was determined by the safety (eg, occurrence, severity, relationship of adverse events to MAS XR) and effectiveness (ADHD Rating Scale scores 19 ) of the drug.  
Cardiovascular Measures Cardiovascular measures included resting/sitting SBP and DBP and resting/sitting pulse rate. BPs were measured in the same arm by the same study personnel using the same cuff when possible (either manual or automated) after the subject had been seated for at least 3 minutes at every study visit. Measurements were taken at baseline and weekly during the short-term study. During the long-term study, cardiovascular measurements were taken at baseline (the last visit of the short-term study), weekly during the first month, and then monthly up to 24 months. The timing of vital sign assessment relative to medication administration was not standardized; however, most clinic visits were likely to have occurred within 12 hours of the morning MAS XR dose. ECG measurements were performed using a 12lead ECG. For the short-term study, ECGs were completed at the screening or baseline visit (baseline ECG), week 2, and again at the final study visit (after 4 weeks of MAS XR treatment or at the final clinic visit if a participant withdrew from the study early). The end point ECG from the short-term study was considered the baseline ECG for the long-term study; repeat ECGs (timed to assess subjects receiving a stable, optimized dose for at least 1 month) were conducted at months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or upon early termination). A central laboratory was used to evaluate all ECG readings (Covance Central Diagnostics, Reno, NV). If the central laboratory deemed an ECG abnormal, the study investigator evaluated the abnormality for clinically significant changes from baseline. If the investigator considered the ECG abnormality to be clinically significant, it was then reviewed by a cardiologist. The Bazett formula was used to correct QT intervals for heart rate effect (QTcB). 20 BP, pulse, and ECGs were not assessed with respect to time of medication dose administration or in relation to peak blood levels of MAS XR in either study. Statistical Analyses Only subjects enrolled in the 4-week doubleblind study were eligible to participate in the 24-month open-label extension study. Subject data for this report were summarized by three rollover categories from the short-term double-blind study: (1) subjects who were new to MAS XR (eg, MAS XR naive: all subjects who were randomized to receive placebo in the short-term study); (2) subjects who received uninterrupted MAS XR treatment (eg, MAS XR continuous: all subjects

observed; however, no subject had a QTcB interval >480 msec (QTcF >454 msec). At end point, two subjects demonstrated a change from baseline QT 2:60 msec and three subjects demonstrated a change from baseline QTcB a60 msec, but none of the final values was >472 msec. Adverse Cardiovascular Events Seven subjects were withdrawn from the study because of cardiovascular adverse events, two subjects because of palpitations and/or tachycardia (MAS XR dose 40 mg/day in both cases), and five subjects because of hypertension (MAS XR 20 mg/day, n=l;  
40 mg/day, n=l; 60 mg/day, n=3). Of the five subjects withdrawn because of hypertension, three had no history of hypertension. Four of the five cases with hypertension exhibited unresolved hypertension during continued follow-up, which suggests the development of primary essential hypertension in these four subjects. An estimated 50 million people in the US have essential hypertension, and the rate observed here (1.8%) appears to be commensurate with the estimated incidence rate of essential hypertension in the general population, as reported in a recent Canadian study. 22 Tachycardia/palpitations resolved in both subjects who discontinued due to this adverse event.

Long-Term Cardiovascular Effects of MAS XR in Adults With ADHD

exposure (ie, MAS XR naive, MAS XR continuous, or MAS XR interrupted). There was no difference between rollover categories in the frequency of such abnormalities. For most subjects with a clinically significant vital sign abnormality at any study visit (pulse >110 bpm, n=18; SBP 2:150 mm Hg, n=17; DBP >100 mm Hg, n=17; QTcB increase 2480 msec, n=0), the abnormality was seen during a single study visit and the subject remained in the study. The highest pulse measured at any time during the study (137 bpm) was seen in a white 24-year old female at month 4 (MAS XR 40 mg/day). This subject had tachycardia at baseline and several postbaseline study visits, for which she received propranolol; it remained unresolved at the time of her later withdrawal from the study due to weight loss. The highest SBP measured (172 mm Hg) was seen in a 28-year-old Asian male (MAS XR 40 mg/day) who had elevated BP at baseline (152 mm Hg); he later discontinued due to worsening hypertension. The highest DBP measured (118 mm Hg; month 5) was seen in a 39-year-old white male (MAS XR 40 mg/ day) who had elevated DBP (112 mm Hg) at week 2 and later discontinued due to noncompliance. The longest QTcB interval observed was 472 msec. Ten subjects had QTcB change from baseline a60 msec (8 males and 2 females). The highest final QTcB in these subjects was 472 msec. No subjects had QTcF change from baseline 26O msec. Two subjects had a clinically significant abnormal ECG interpretation during at least one clinic visit among the 223 subjects enrolled in  
this extension study. One subject exhibited an abnormal T-wave and a lengthened QT interval at baseline, both of which resolved during the study. The second subject exhibited clinically significant left anterior hemiblock beginning at month 3 that was ongoing at month 24Neither subject was withdrawn from the study. DISCUSSION____________________________ This is the first detailed assessment of cardiovascular changes in adults during long-term treatment with an XR stimulant formulation. It also is the largest study examining the long-term effects of a stimulant medication in adults with ADHD. For the majority of adult subjects in this study, the average cardiovascular effects of MAS XR appear to be minimal with up to 24 months of treatment. For the vast majority of subjects, mean changes in pulse, BP, and ECG interval measurements were not clinically significant. A small number of subjects exhibited significant changes from baseline in vital signs and ECG assessments. However, only seven subjects (7/223; 3.1%) were withdrawn from the study because of a cardiovascular event. The current analysis is significant in that it provides the first substantial evidence demonstrating that long-term stimulant therapy in otherwise healthy adults with ADHD tends to cause minimal changes in BP, pulse, and ECG parameters. This is particularly important given the increasing vulnerability to elevated BP and pulse that is seen with advancing age. In general, the changes in cardiovas-

Long-Term Cardiovascular Effects of MAS XR in Adults With ADHD

or long-term use of MAS XR in patients with significant cardiovascular dysfunction or BP abnormalities are unknown. The study population included adults who were not receiving any other medications that could affect BP or pulse. The addition of XR stimulant formulations to other medications with cardiovascular effects in adults with ADHD has not been assessed. Lack of standardization in the timing of medication administration and assessment of vital signs could have resulted in measurements after the medication effects had worn off, but this is unlikely given that few clinic visits would have occurred >12 hours after dosing. CONCLUSION________________________________ The cardiovascular effects of MAS XR appear minimal in patients with ADHD who are otherwise in good physical health; they are similar to those reported for pediatric patients and with both short - and long-acting amphetamines and methylphenidate, as well as the nonstimulant atomoxetine. While the AHA guidelines regarding the evaluation of heart rate and BP at baseline and during follow-up pertain to children and adolescents, we believe these same guidelines should apply to adults as well. Given the incidence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease seen in adults, routine monitoring of vital signs at baseline and periodically throughout treatment in adults with ADHD is recommended. The FDA and Health Canada have both issued guidelines regarding the use of stimulants in patients thought to have structural cardiac abnormalities. K2££] REFERENCES___________________________ 1.
