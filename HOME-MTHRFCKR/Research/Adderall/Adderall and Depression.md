A lot of people find that long-term Adderall use leaves them feeling deeply depressed, demotivated, and severely anxious. This is true of those who come off Adderall and those who continue using the drug.

However, there is some evidence to suggest that Adderall may actually be an effective treatment for depression in adults.

## **Using Adderall for Depression: Dosages & How To Take**

In some cases, Adderall can be used to help treat the symptoms of depression and anxiety. This may sound strange, but in some people [Adderall can act as a calming agent](https://www.ijest.org/nootropics/does-adderall-calm-you-down/).
