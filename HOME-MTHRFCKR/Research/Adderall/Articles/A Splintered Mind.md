# A Splintered Mind: ADHD: Brain Fog Is No Laughing Matter. Well, Maybe Just a Little

## ADHD: Brain Fog Is No Laughing Matter. Well, Maybe Just a Little

*Call it brain fog, absentmindedness, or a senior moment, but sometimes when your ADHD brain goes on the fritz, you‚Äôve just got to laugh.*

![Brain Fog](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2022/brainfog.png "Brain Fog")

I am here today to tell you that playing Sudoku daily ***will not improve brain fog***. I know. I‚Äôve tried multiple Sudoku books & apps, Sudoku with words, and there‚Äôs a Sudoku game out there for the Nintendo Switch that would let me play with fluffy blobs of cats, but I‚Äôm not entirely convinced that will work either. [Adults with ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read some more tips on managing ADHD") deal with brain fog on a general basis, so over the years I figured doing mental activities to improve my concentration and presence of mind couldn‚Äôt hurt.

Who says that Sudoku improves concentration? The same people who used to swear by crossword puzzles, usually. [Certainly, not me.](http://douglascootey.com/search?q=sudoku) No, I kid. I love playing Sudoku and feel more focused after solving a few puzzles, but after the week I‚Äôve just had, I can tell you that it‚Äôs clearly not working as a prevention.

There was that moment where I was distracted cleaning up my Nintendo Friend List. Who were all these people? Clearly, all that meditation I had been doing under mountain waterfalls had failed to sharpen my wits. There was this one entry labeled ‚ÄúApril‚Äù with a bulbous Kirby as her avatar. *Hey! I know an April!* But is it the same April? Moments before bringing an impulse to life via text, I stopped myself, iPhone in hand, and thought hard for the first time in days. *You can‚Äôt just ask somebody out of the blue if their gaming avatar is Kirby, Douglas. Does she even game? Waitaminute‚Ä¶how long has it been since you reached out to her anyway? Crud! Has it been months‚ÄΩ*

In fact, it had been so long since I last texted her that the conversation had been automatically deleted. For all I knew, I had left her on ‚ÄúRead‚Äù since last year. Suddenly, I realized again that the dream I had about [forgetting that I was dating somebody](http://douglascootey.com/2022/05/adhd-i-forgot-that-i-was-dating-somebody.html) wasn‚Äôt so far from reality.

Last weekend, I was talking with a friend about the latest Spider-man movie that was rereleased into theaters. He couldn‚Äôt believe that I hadn‚Äôt seen it yet. He stared at me like I had three heads. I had insisted that he watch the first two movies last Fall (that ***HE*** hadn‚Äôt seen) so that he could catch up in order to see the movie in theaters with me. Then I got sick.

Later I found out that he went and saw it with family instead while I was sick in bed. Why are we still friends? How could my friend not know how sick I‚Äôve been? But never mind that. Why do we say *‚Äúthree heads‚Äù*? Wouldn‚Äôt two heads be weird enough? Were two heads a normal thing ages ago, thus making three heads something outside of the norm? Perhaps there‚Äôs something more to the ‚Äútwo-faced‚Äù idiom. ü§î

At any rate, he was right that I was adamant about him getting caught up. I wanted the shared cinematic experience. I realize I was bedridden for much of the winter, but it‚Äôs strange that I never bought the movie, or streamed it online. It couldn‚Äôt be that I forgot about it. One of my daughters loved the movie so much, she rented out a seat and lived in the theater during its first run. It‚Äôs all she texted about for weeks.

I think this is more like that ADHD joke, *‚ÄúOooh! Shiny!‚Äù*, but on a larger scale. For me it‚Äôs a Tourettes episode that lasts for more than a few days or an illness that lasts for a week. I lose track of my current goal if I go too many days without working on it. I‚Äôm running forward headlong towards a goal when something happens, then POOF! What goal?

I compensate for this, usually, but having a ton of reminders and to do lists. I‚Äôm pretty good about keeping track of most of it. It‚Äôs how I‚Äôve written two books, blogged professionally for years, and raised kids. However, every once in a while something slips through the cracks. This time it was responding to a text and seeing a movie I had planned on. The brain fog from Long COVID (or chronic fatigue syndrome‚Äîwhatever they‚Äôre going to call it), only makes my [ADHD absentmindedness](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read some more tips on managing ADHD") worse. It can be frustrating. Whenever this forgetfulness interferes with my life, I try to have a good laugh, but not laugh it off. It‚Äôs important to acknowledge some of these quirks are funny. It‚Äôs better than hating myself as I used to do decades ago. However, a healthy sense of humor is the only thing that seems to be healthy about me lately.

Maybe I just need to play even ***more*** Sudoku. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll fix things.

## ADHD Fixation: The Dark Side of Hyperfocus

A lot is made of ADHD‚Äôs super power of hyperfocus. I‚Äôve written about it on [several](http://douglascootey.com/2013/09/adhd-three-ways-to-engage-hyperfocus-at.html) [occasions](http://douglascootey.com/2006/03/adhd-dealing-with-distractibility.html) over the years as well. I‚Äôve even created a [ToDo List technique](http://douglascootey.com/2013/02/better-than-todos-i-calling-them-3dos.html) to simulate it!

Should we really label hyperfocus as a superpower, though? I have always been painfully aware of [the downsides to hyperfocus](http://douglascootey.com/2011/03/distracted-how-adhd-almost-kicked-my.html). I‚Äôll even avoid undertaking certain tasks because I know that I‚Äôll slip into hyperfocus and loose track of time and the events around me. It‚Äôs not always a desirable state of mind to be in.

Normally, [adults with adhd](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read some more tips on managing ADHD") might as well be hamsters on a wheel, furiously running, but not getting anywhere. Suddenly, hyperfocus grants us clarity of vision and purpose, opening the road in front of us into a straight line towards success. When your days are spent fighting against your own brain to get something done, hyperfocus is a big deal.

## So, what‚Äôs so Bad about Hyperfocus?

Hyperfocus without limits is a form of tunnel vision. I like to say that character flaws are talents gone awry. If hyperfocus is a talent, then its flipside is fixation. This ADHD fixation occurs when hyperfocus has no endgame. There is only the project and the drive to complete the project. Everything else is ignored while we relentlessly pursue our goal.

‚ÄúBut Douglas!‚Äù I hear you say. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt focusing on completing the project an endgame?‚Äù

It seems that way, doesn‚Äôt it? Hyperfocus is wonderful when the project moves smoothly from start to finish without inconveniencing anybody. What happens if hyperfocus makes you difficult to work with, though? What happens when you encounter a hitch? Do you step back and rethink your approach to the project, or do you run forward in hyperfocused hamster mode, furiously running in circles, but with greater energy?

I recall a time when a college friend and I were working on an import Japanese goods startup business. We ran into software issues which affected the catalog layout. Instead of stepping away to research the issue, I continued struggling against the software for hours while my friend grew more and more frustrated. I didn‚Äôt listen to a darn thing he said. He pleaded with me to find another solution, but I continued. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm almost done. Just one more sec.‚Äù I never did resolve the issue, so what did all that intense hyperfocus accomplish? Over the last three decades, I have trained myself to not become so fixated when other people were waiting in the wings. However, I still inconvenience myself if I don‚Äôt watch for it.

## How Do I Stop Myself from Slipping into Hyperfocus?

Life is filled with moments where we have to park our hyperfocus in order to function with those around us. While raising children, I had to put the brakes on hyperfocus so that my children wouldn‚Äôt have to wait for me to finish a project before, oh, feeding them perhaps? Even last night, I put off writing this article until my adult autistic daughter was put to bed.

When I find myself out in the weeds filled with glorious purpose, I use these tips to drag myself back to the road:

1.  **Become aware of which activities you tend to hyperfocus on.** The first step is developing an awareness of yourself. Knowing which activities catch your attention will help you avoid them when you have other responsibilities.
2.  **Clear away your responsibilities before allowing yourself to sink into hyperfocus.** This is a core issue that is made difficult by the very nature of ADHD itself. However, you can train yourself to do this. It takes effort, but it is achievable.
3.  **Begin with the ending time in mind.** This is where I trip myself up. Have a clear idea of how much time you can allow yourself to work on a project before you begin. Use physical timers and phone reminders to keep yourself on track.
4.  **Stop when you should.** This is the hardest skill of all when hyperfocus whips us forward in a euphoria of clarity. You don‚Äôt have to wait until you‚Äôve made a wreckage of your life before learning this skill.
5.  **Reassess your project and be flexible enough to change course if necessary.** Hyperfocus will have you endlessly working the wrong approach to completion. Our first ideas aren‚Äôt always the wisest, even if they are compelling.

## Get it Right with Practice

I love hyperfocus; I despise ADHD fixation. Nothing good ever comes of being fixated. I become inflexible, obsessed, and out of touch with the world around me. Years ago, [I melted more than a few pans on the stovetop](http://douglascootey.com/2006/03/adhd-dealing-with-distractibility.html) before learning not to work on a project while also cooking. It is true that sometimes ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù ideas are lost when I prevent myself from getting hyperfocused, but I‚Äôd rather be reactive and bored than brilliantly hyperfocused while the world burns around me.

## That Time ADHD Helped Me Win a Couple of Auctions

![My budget can't handle being sick with ADHD](http://cootey.com/pix/2022/FlyingMoney.gif "My budget can't handle being sick with ADHD")

The problem with chronic illness is that it's boring. I don't mean for the person stricken in bed and suffering. Who cares about them, right‚∏Æ I am referring to everybody else who finds the subject duller than a twenty-four hour CSPAN marathon. When the chronically sick try to tell others about their struggles, they are likely to receive no small degree of exasperation from people who can't hide their dismay, as if to say "What? This again?"

Of course, not everybody is so callous, and even if they are, they aren't likely to be so open about it. They'll smile at you, nod their head sympathetically, tell you to call them if you ever need anything, then disconnect their phone number. I am almost certain this is what really happens, or at least, I am mostly certain since my observations were possibly affected by my 102¬∞F fever. As I've written over and over before, I contracted COVID-19 in October like an early Halloween treat, received RSV for Thankgiving, then had a string of mystery respiratory viruses all the way into April. Despite blogging about this three and a half dozen times, nobody has sent me bales of cash with a sweet "Get Well" card yet. In fact, I would have simply been happy to have received a postcard from Healthy Town, USA with the words, "Wish you were here," scrawled on the back, but no such luck.

In March, I celebrated six months of respiratory viruses by bringing another one home with me from the virus distribution center. This was a proper bookend to COVID-19, complete with five days of a 101¬∞F fever, and it left me bedridden with nothing to do except‚Ä¶what was that?

"Stop being so negative, dear."  
"Don't identify as your illness, my dude."  
"Keep your plague to yourself."  
"You were sick?"

That last one was from one of my beloved daughters, so yes, I was sick. And I had a lot of time to think about things like ADHD, Depression, the fascinating patterns in my ceiling, and how I was going to eat. I can assure you that modern amenities don't accommodate the sick in bed. You can imagine my frustration when I discovered Door Dash would not, in fact, come to my bedroom door. Never mind that I'd have to mail them my front door key first, which I couldn't do from beneath my bedsheets.

If chronic illness is boring for others on the outside, just imagine how boring it is for us on the inside. Couple that boredom with ADHD, and I can get up to dangerous mischief without leaving my bed. During my tumultuous time of illness, when I survived by eating my pillow, I would pass the days propping my iPhone on one arm while I weakly flopped the other arm in its general direction, randomly stabbing at the screen as my hand passed by it. In this way, I surfed the net and kept myself entertained. I can inform you with great authority that being sick in bed with ADHD and an iPhone is a very, very bad situation. Especially when eBay is involved.

Somehow, in my feverish state‚Äîwhere I enjoyed reading badly written books because I was too sick to notice‚ÄîI also took time to bid on several out of print Pok√©mon games. I do have an interest in that game series, I must confess, and that in itself wasn't the problem. Bidding on something in order to keep an eye on the auction instead of simply adding it to my watch list was the source of my trouble. I not only won both, very expensive auctions, but I discovered to my alarm that I already owned one of them.

I had forgotten the age-old adage passed down to me by blessed family members who had learned the hard way: "Never bid on auctions when you're sick!" Or perhaps it was my own adage learned at the School of Hard Slaps. I was too feeble-minded to recall.

I recovered long enough a week later to relist the items on eBay immediately after they arrived and before my bank account began to hemorrhage from my stupidity. Both items sold quickly, and when all fees had been totaled, I was out about five bucks between the two. Disaster averted.

I've been writing about [coping strategies for adults with ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD") for seventeen years now. In that time I have shared my most blockheaded moments for your entertainment, though I have not shared them all. Some ADHD mistakes are colossal in their stupidity and should be kept secret, buried in a vault, and forgotten by time. Fortunately for you, my deft auctioneering was not one of those moments. Take note and learn, my friends, which moments are the worst for your ADHD.

Illness and ADHD are a terrible combo for me. There are many things I will not allow myself to do while sick, mostly because being bored out of my mind while suffering from reduced impulse control always gets me into trouble. Perhaps that might explain why I have an old LP of Artie Shaw arriving today even though I don't have access to a record player.

Coping Strategy: Never bid on auctions when you're sick or tired while experiencing a case of chronic ADHD.

## ADHD ‚Äì I Forgot that I Was Dating Somebody?

*Can you be so forgetful that you‚Äôd forget that you were dating somebody? For a few groggy moments, I was convinced that I had.*

![A Real Sensitive Guy](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2022/philosodator.jpg "A Real Sensitive Guy")

As I dealt with forgotten bills, paperwork unearthed from the Jurassic era, and various and sundry things I had meant to get to sometime around last September, I wondered if maybe, perhaps possibly, I was forgetful.

Oh, everybody forgets things! It‚Äôs perfectly normal. For example, my mother routinely forgets my name. After bringing me into this world many long and hoary decades ago, you‚Äôd think she‚Äôd have gotten the hang of it by now, but there she goes again, calling me by name by starting with the youngest son then moving upwards through the sediment of time until she comes around to me.

[People with ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD") are just like that, except with trips to another room, a few phone calls, and a sudden urge to reorganize their closet in between each name. Perfectly normal! That‚Äôs why you probably won‚Äôt be surprised to hear that I‚Äôve forgotten quite a bit over the past half year.

My Fall was more hectic than usual. I started with a car accident in August, surgery in September, COVID‚Äì19 in October, RSV in November, then an attempt to catch every virus in Utah before the merry-go-round came to a stop last month. I‚Äôm surprised I didn‚Äôt end up with Hanta Virus somehow, as well as Chicken Pox for a third time. My life was such a wreck, I was lucky I remembered my ***own*** name!

Some [interruptions derail the ADHD train](http://douglascootey.com/search?q=adhd+interruption) so completely that when we finally get our caboose back up on the tracks, we often head off in a new direction. It‚Äôs not unusual for me to suddenly realize two months after getting over a death match with the Black Plague that I accidentally started a new project instead of resuming an old one. But there go I introducing a new metaphor. You‚Äôd think I had enough archeological material to work with considering how much my bedroom resembles a dig.

Speaking of my bedroom, aside from creating geological strata in all four corners with paperwork, I have been known to sleep there on occasion. Imagine, if you will, my sleepy head emerging from the covers one shiny morning in a panic. No, I hadn‚Äôt been buried under the weight of over half a year of mail. I had dreamed that I had suddenly realized that I had a girlfriend who I hadn‚Äôt called since September. I was so alarmed in the dream that my heart began pounding as I struggled to remember her name. How could I have forgotten my darling! Then my lucid brain had a chat with my dreaming brain and came to an agreement that it was time to wake up.

As I laid there in the bed calming my racing heart, I chuckled to myself. Like I could ever forget somebody so important as a girlfriend‚Ä¶ Then I had a real moment of panic as I realized that I forget people all the time! I forget their names, I forget to call them back, and I forget that I‚Äôm on the phone with them when I suddenly start organizing my closet. Yes, I concluded from the sagacious perch of my pillow. I could possibly forget somebody that important.

But did I? I began to worry that maybe I had broken somebody‚Äôs heart. How do you apologize for accidentally ghosting somebody for eight months? Fortunately, my lucid brain realized that I was still sleepy and the whole incident was nonsense. There was no girlfriend. I was absolutely in the clear.

Probably.

I'm still surprised that I am so used to being forgetful that I could honestly believe such a dream-addled fiction, even for a moment. To my credit, I‚Äôm not so forgetful that I would space off a relationship, but if I ever do get a girlfriend and forget her name, you‚Äôll know I‚Äôll be buried with the dinosaurs if I‚Äôm tempted to dig through the layers of my memory and start rattling off past girlfriends‚Äô names until I finally arrive at the right one.

## Blind as an ADHD Bat

*Ever been so ADHD that you can‚Äôt see what you‚Äôre looking for, even when it‚Äôs right in front of your face?*

![I‚Äôm over here! (iPhone hiding in plain sight)](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2022/InPlainSight.jpg "I‚Äôm over here! (iPhone hiding in plain sight)")

Given that ADHD has as many flavors as a bag of jelly beans, you might not all relate with ADHD tunnel vision. I, unfortunately, can‚Äôt say the same. If I had a jelly bean for every time something I was looking for was found right there in front of me, I could go into business and give Jelly Belly a run for their money.

Today, the missing item was my iPhone. I got up from the table, left the kitchen, then wondered where my iPhone had gone. I went downstairs and searched for it. My daughter called it. I visited every room of the home as I retraced my steps all over the place. I imagine I traced paths just as comically convoluted as any you can find in Family Circus. Finally! Finally. There was one room I hadn‚Äôt visited. The kitchen. And there was my iPhone. The ringer had been turned off, but it was right where I had been sitting at the table, hidden in plain sight, clear as the nose on the end of my face, lying on the table next to my empty glass of strawberry lemonade.

Was I blind? In a matter of speaking, yes.

Sometimes [ADHD concentration can be narrow-focused](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD"). In fact, this tunnel-vision can be so tight that we can miss things sitting out in the open. Haven‚Äôt you ever looked for an item, rummaged all around, then found it in the first place you had looked in? ‚ÄúHow could I have missed this?‚Äù you might think. It was what you were looking for, yet you couldn‚Äôt see it. As I‚Äôve mentioned before, [ADHD attention dysfunctions](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD") aren‚Äôt too different than what anybody else might experience except in frequency and flair.

I used to constantly lose my wallet and keys in stupid places. They couldn‚Äôt be more obvious if they were waving a sign, yet I‚Äôd still look right over them. This lack of attention is caused by information overload and a lack of impulse control. To find objects, our minds will phase out extraneous details as we scan over the environment for the item we are searching for. With ADHD folks, everything can be an extraneous detail when we‚Äôre preoccupied!

In general, I‚Äôve found that if I‚Äôm mistaken about the color, shape, or presentation of the item I am looking for‚Äîas in I have a preconceived notion of the item‚Äôs appearance‚ÄîI‚Äôll even put my hands on it, but pass it right by. Wallets and keys are familiar objects, so we have a better chance of noticing them, but if we are distracted at the right moment, any object can become invisible to us.

Unfortunately, there is no cure for this particular myopia. For me, it‚Äôs as much a part of ADHD as distractibility. I know I can look forward to future scenarios where I lose my iPhone while it sits there on the bed or table and mocks me.

> ‚ÄúHey, Siri! Where are you?‚Äù[¬π](http://douglascootey.com/2022/09/adhd-brain-fog-is-no-laughing-matter.html#fn:1 "see footnote")  
> ‚ÄúRight in front of you, stupid.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúHey! Siri, you‚Äôre getting kinda cheeky lately.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúStop *‚Äúlosing‚Äù* me then.‚Äù  

To avoid imagined fights with Siri and other AI assistants in the future, I have come up with some tips that help me minimize the times I turn a blind ADHD eye to my belongings:

1.  **Tidy up before you go:** If I had cleaned up after myself before I left the table, I never would have misplaced my iPhone. I generally do this in public, but am lazier about it at home.
2.  **Doublecheck, triple check‚Ä¶just check again, already!:** Develop the habit of checking for your belongings before walking away from where you‚Äôve been. I don‚Äôt want to make you neurotic, but this is a life-saving habit. I can‚Äôt recommend it enough.
3.  **Bluetooth trackers:** These l‚Äôil devices will save you so much headache and worry. I use Tile devices. I‚Äôve attached them to my wallet, keys, and go bag. As long as you keep the batteries fresh, you‚Äôll not worry again about where anything is. Now if only they made Tiles small enough to stick on my eyeglasses. I swear those things slip through dimensional pockets and reappear in random places.
4.  **A place for everything, and everything in its place:** Train yourself to place important items in specific locations. I‚Äôve done this with my wallet and keys. They go in one place, and one place only. I almost never need to use the bluetooth trackers to find them anymore because I don‚Äôt lose them. My iPhone on the other hand‚Ä¶
5.  **Take a deep breath, calm your mind, and look again:** Once I become agitated and frustrated, it helps to take a second to center myself, then look again with fresh eyes. I usually see what I‚Äôve been looking for soon after.

Developing these habits will help you become more mindful of where your possessions are, thus helping you get back up and running in a hurry. However, if you do find somebody handing out jelly beans for finding things in plain sight, please let me know. I‚Äôve got a killer plan for taking over the confectionary world. Now, if only I could remember where I placed it.

## ADHD: Here Are Five Steps I Use to Rein In My Focus

*A lack of focus is the one common trait that all adults with ADHD seem to have, but focus isn‚Äôt as elusive as you might fear.*

![Using timed reminders is one tool I use to maintain focus.](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2022/maintain.focus.png "Using timed reminders is one tool I use to maintain focus.")

The other day, a friend texted me out of the blue. He wanted a list of some of the things that I do to maintain focus. Initially, I panicked. I‚Äôve been chronically ill since getting COVID‚Äì19 last October. I haven‚Äôt blogged in four months, so my ADHD advice muscles were all out of shape. Fortunately for my friend, I haven‚Äôt met a topic yet that I didn‚Äôt have an opinion on, so I worked up my courage and sent a list to him.

Finding focus is a complicated issue for [adults with ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD"). There are times when we have far too much focus and times when focus is as rare as a moderate during election primaries. Too much. Too little. This would be fine to work with if there was predictable rhythm to the pattern, but usually we find ourselves with too much focus on things we shouldn‚Äôt be doing (often called hyperfocus), and too little focus on the things that we should (often called many rude labels that I won‚Äôt bother listing). How do we regulate that‚ÄΩ This is why I believe ADHD should refer to an attention dysfunction disorder, not a deficit.

The key to focus is understanding that [ADHD minds have an aversion to boredom](http://douglascootey.com/search?q=boredom). Scolding somebody to not be bored motivates somebody about as well as a gun to the head. There may be some short term benefits, but in the long run, it will create self-esteem issues and other psychological hangups. Instead, accept that boredom is part of the problem and address it with targeted coping strategies.

# Here Are Five Steps I Use to Rein in My Focus

1.  **Simplify your tasks:** I break projects down into three steps at a time, usually in the form of a checklist, and memorize those steps. I call them my [ThreeDos](http://douglascootey.com/2013/09/adhd-three-ways-to-engage-hyperfocus-at.html), instead of ToDos. I find I can simulate ADHD hyperfocus by doing this, but without the downside of being totally immersed in my own world and deaf to the one around me.
2.  **Drown out distractions:** I like playing [EDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music) to pump up my energy levels, but any music that excites you will do. Dance music causes me to tap my feet, which has the same focusing effect as exercise. It‚Äôs important to not play any music with lyrics if you haven‚Äôt heard the songs before. The purpose is to prevent distractions, not add to them! If EDM doesn‚Äôt work because I‚Äôm working with others or I need to stay attentive to outside interruptions, I will play white noise (often mixed with brown and pink noise).
3.  **Timers are key to focus:** Use a timer and work for shorter periods. I‚Äôve found I can work for about forty-five minutes when focused, but I start with twenty minute periods at first, building up from there. Once the timer goes off, take a mental break. Look around. Check in with others. Disengage from your task for a moment. Then, after a few moments, start your next timed session. If you work at home, an old fashioned kitchen timer can be effective, but if you work with others, a soft alert sound on your phone can be just as effective.
4.  **Alarms and reminders can keep you on task:** Similar to timers, having a message pop up on your phone can jog your memory if you‚Äôve become distracted, or keep you on track if your focus is fading. I often utilize Siri on my iPhone to set reminders. Where this tool becomes most useful is when I‚Äôm in the middle of a working session, but don‚Äôt want to forget something that comes to me. ‚ÄúHey, Siri. Remind me in twenty minutes to call X.‚Äù Utilize your phone, no matter the platform, for on the fly reminders instead of trusting your memory.
5.  **Make sure you are fed and hydrated:** You can‚Äôt focus without fuel, yet this one step eludes me time and time again. Hyperfocus is often to blame. I have found that when I plan in meals with my breaks as outlined above, I focus better, and I am far more productive.

When my productivity drops and time sails out the window, I know I haven‚Äôt been applying these coping strategies. I may not be able to get rid of my ADHD, but I can regulate it. Making the effort to tighten my focus helps me accomplish what I set out to do. Hopefully, these tips will help my friend, and maybe you as well.

## When Does [[../../Research.md]] Become a Fixation?

*I pull back the curtain a bit today, revealing a deep, dark secret about myself‚Äîa secret so dank, surely I‚Äôll lose the last three readers I have.*

![Pandoras Box from an unknown artist at Pixiv](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2022/Pixiv.Pandoras.Box.jpg "Pandora's Box from an unknown artist at Pixiv")

I‚Äôve been reading far too many Japanese light novels lately.

It started as a form of research, but now I actually like the darn things. I can‚Äôt get enough of them. They‚Äôre my personal Pandora‚Äôs Box. I opened the beautiful, ornately engraved box, saw the plentiful wonders inside, and now I can‚Äôt shut the lid. Is this an [ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD") obsession, or a newfound joy? I can‚Äôt tell, which is why I‚Äôm troubled. Have you seen my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14845276.Douglas_Cootey) timeline? I read almost all escapist manga and light novels these days. I know [I‚Äôve been struggling with depression](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression") lately, but it‚Äôs embarrassing! I‚Äôm sitting here wearing a Fair Isle style, wool sweater, a designer, long-sleeved, henley shirt, and Izod tech pants, not a 1-ply t-shirt featuring Sailor Moon with chip crumbs all over my belly. How will my polished author image survive this lapse in pretentiousness?

In 2019, I had noticed that many of my favorite anime that season had origins as light novels in Japan. The more I looked into them, the more I realized that most anime was based on successful light novels. I‚Äôm not sure when they crowded out manga as the number one source. Even many successful manga are light novel spin-offs these days.

The best way to describe a light novel is as if pulp fiction and anime had a baby. Most stories are told in the first person. Most are written in a rush, with rapid output outweighing literary craft as the number one priority. The emphasis is on story and entertainment, not languid, literary explorations of contemporary themes. That‚Äôs where light novels are similar to pulp fiction, but where they differ is that the stories share more in common with comics with overpowered characters, romance being secondary to adventure, and so many portals open to fantasy worlds, it‚Äôs surprising Japan has any population left. In fact, many read like visual scripts to anime‚Äîas if the authors already have the licensing goals in mind. At worst, they can be fannish, derivative tales where they don‚Äôt milk tropes as much as they stick a spicket in and drain them by the bucketful.

Light Novels are not all bad. Otherwise, I wouldn‚Äôt spend so much time enjoying them. I‚Äôve found my favorites. The intricate settings of ***Ascendance of a Bookworm*** are inspiring, as is the characterization and complicated plot. So much detail and research went into that series that I‚Äôm a little bit in awe of it. ***Unnamed Memory*** is gorgeously written. Earlier volumes are more sumptuous than later volumes, but over all I find the strong world and character building very engaging. The story reads like a fairytale whodunnit. The marathon-named ***Banished from the Hero‚Äôs Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside*** is a LitRPG, traditional high fantasy story that slowly reveals deep explorations on the meaning of free will while it subverts the proverbial hero role. Like ***Unnamed Memory***, the story bucks the Light Novel trend and features romance in a warm and healthy way. Also, the ***Rascal Does Not Dream of‚Ä¶*** series is notable for its rapid-fire and funny dialog. Imagine a Young Adult ***X-files*** crossed with ***Moonlighting*** situated in Japan. The story is funny, but the author makes me care about the characters. The last volume was a bit cruel with my heartstrings.

Reading for research is one thing, but light novels have replaced vegging out in front of the boob tube. That‚Äôs an improvement, right‚∏Æ They‚Äôve replaced gaming, too. The downside is now that I read for fun, I‚Äôm no longer studying the craft, the pacing, the compromises, or the output of the authors involved.

I blame [j-novel.club](https://j-novel.club/) (JNC). I paid for a subscription to read everything I could get my hands on. I wanted to understand the phenomenon better. JNC serializes the stories as they are serialized in Japan‚Äîweekly‚Äîso one can find themselves quite busy keeping on top of several series all week long. I just paid for **one month**, but here I am two years later. I‚Äôm just glad that JNC doesn‚Äôt serialize daily as some of the stories are released in Japan.

I‚Äôm not complaining. Light novels and Kindle Vella gave me the kick in the butt I needed to write more. Serializing daily? Do you realize how much work that is? Even if the output is a tropey lark with no originality, I am still impressed with the dedication and output. On top of my Tourette‚Äôs and other issues, the pandemic, along with family drama, snuffed out my writing flame. I felt like a podling from Dark Crystal, drained and lifeless as I moved from day to day. Now I‚Äôm anxiously engaged in a good cause in my own way instead of letting depression win.

If only I could cut back on reading and do more writing. *(Serialized daily! I‚Äôm exhausted just thinking about it.)*

## Doomsday in December?

*I‚Äôm run down and sick, so I‚Äôm posting something positive every day this week until I lift my spirits.*

![Hipstamatic Photo. Looking Fine!](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/HipstamaticPhoto-LookingFine.jpg "Hipstamatic Photo. Looking Fine!")

There is a reason I‚Äôm depressed. It‚Äôs more than having [major and persistent depression disorder](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression"). I‚Äôve had a surprisingly cruddy year. I have to admit that I‚Äôm frustrated because my coping strategies are failing me. This is the sort of year that could only happen to a protagonist in a dark comedy. I‚Äôve already written before how I was severely sick for seven months **before** the pandemic began. This feels like slow death sometimes. I‚Äôm so isolated from others, I‚Äôm forgetting how to be human.

Here‚Äôs my calendar since May. I think it‚Äôs a bit much:

> **May:** I began running to lose weight and get in shape, but tore my right meniscus in my knee. I know its a torn meniscus, but insurance demands I do physical therapy first. Thus ends my newfound hobby, as well as my summer of longboarding before it began.  
> **June:** Babying my torn meniscus, I bent over to get something out of the fridge and ripped my quadratic lomborum on my right side. How did such a thing happen? When did I become so frangible? I have to cancel my knee PT.  
> **July:** My back is improving, but still sore. No exercise can be done, though I manage to walk long miles. It‚Äôs very painful, especially on the knee, but I‚Äôm determined to lose weight and get in shape. Then I catch a summer virus and go down for three weeks.  
> **August:** I feel like I‚Äôm getting back on top of my life, though my LD daughter began an extremely volatile stage this month. We haven‚Äôt seen temper outbursts like this in a few years, so it was surprising. It took up enormous amounts of time to deal with. Halfway through the month, She and I got rear ended on a highway onramp in the rain. One driver ahead of me braked, causing a pileup. The guy in front of me avoided that guy, and I avoided him, but the guy behind me wasn‚Äôt as skillful. Now I need a chiropractor, I can‚Äôt do my PT, and my car is wrecked. But we are alive and thankful that things weren‚Äôt worse.  
> **September:** Mostly filled with chiropractic visits until 2/3rds through when I have surgery to correct my torn meniscus. By the end of the month, I had one day where I began to feel functional again. I spent the day helping parents register their car, but not mine. I‚Äôd do it on Monday, except‚Ä¶  
> **October:** I got COVID‚Äì19 despite dual vaccinations. It was probably Delta. I have never been so sick in my life. It lasted for weeks, eating up the entire month.  
> **November:** Finally, I‚Äôm feeling normal again! I register my car. I get the insurance fiasco and repairs going. I put out fires here and there that had begun to smolder in my life. Then my daughter got RSV. I spent eight days tending to her needs. She hadn‚Äôt been as sick as that in twenty years. Then she shared it with me. I tested positive for RSV and COVID a week an a half ago. I hear I‚Äôll test positive for COVID for up to three months. My symptoms were all RSV, but I was already run down from COVID. It was brutal. I‚Äôm still sick. Fortunately, I got the car in for repair. The bill came to over $5000, but insurance paid for it. One bright moment. I got my car back today, and I feel strangely giddy about my worldly possession. I have freedom again.  
> **December:** That‚Äôs tomorrow. Nothing short of disaster and ruin can follow up this chain of events. December shall usher in a personal Ragnar√∂k, resulting in smoke, carnage, and a crater where my hopes and dreams once resided. Oh, is that negative? Gosh, shucks. I wonder why my outlook is so dark?

What‚Äôs most frustrating is that for most days, there is no brightness or joy in my life‚Äîjust sickness, pain, and suffering. No friends to socialize with. I‚Äôm quarantining. No health to explore the world around me. I‚Äôm too sick to be active, and going outside will result in me getting more sickness. Just me stuck at home, sick and miserable with a compromised immunity system. In the past, I would hold tight and wait for Spring when the warmer weather would begin my days of living and health. It‚Äôs a dull way to live, though.

I recognize that this entry is filled with self-pity. Nobody set me up for a fall. There are no angry gods making sure my life is perfectly disastrous. Yet still, I had such high writing goals for the year. I needed to reach forward and lift myself up. I have little patience for life‚Äôs nastier distractions.

This is why I‚Äôm posting something positive every day. This journal entry doesn‚Äôt quite count. It‚Äôs sad, bitter therapy, but I feel better getting it out. No, I‚Äôm referring to my attempts at gratitude. Here is today‚Äôs:

> I‚Äôm grateful for ebooks. I can go out shopping at 4am, dressed in swaddling clothes, and never leave my bed. üìñ

I have not given up hope, but I may not make my writing goals. I wanted to have my new fiction work up on Kindle Vella by Saturday. That may happen. I wanted my [ADHD visual ToDos](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD") book up on Kindle Unlimited by my birthday. That may happen. I owe a friend quite a few articles for his website. I think I can bang them out by the end of year, but it might be a bit much to expect them done by my birthday as well. I also wanted to reach certain goals in my Japanese studies. Those may happen. I‚Äôm not dead yet, and wallowing only makes depression stronger, which makes productivity harder. It is dour enough that I am sickly. My mental outlook doesn‚Äôt have to reflect that. I‚Äôve been lazy in my coping strategies. It is time to recommit to being in control.

With that said, I‚Äôm being grateful and posting a blog today. I even took a selfie and tried to make myself look human. These are three proactive tasks that are hard to do when my outlook is bleak, but I feel that I‚Äôve accomplished something, even if this blog is overly maudlin, lacking in humor, and heavy on ruthful observations. I‚Äôm getting it out of my system. I‚Äôm going to put this year behind me. I‚Äôm going to succeed.

## Feeling Down, So It‚Äôs Time To Be Grateful

*Sometimes life gets me down. So what am I going to do about it?*

![Moody Sunset Looking West](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/MoodySunset.jpeg "Moody Sunset Looking West") I‚Äôve been way too sick to blog lately or post here. I mostly lay in bed and cough. It‚Äôs a party! But I did get some [book writing](http://douglascootey.com/2016/11/books-by-douglas-cootey.html "My growing list of published books. A new one by the end of 2021!") in. One more chapter, and I‚Äôll be ready to post it on Kindle Vella. Now I just need to design a fetching avatar for the book.

I started feeling better yesterday‚Ä¶marginally. I had energy enough to remotely log into my four computers and setup SSH key pairs, moved some doge into a dedicated hot wallet, listed items on eBay, updated my dynamic DNS account to make sure my web and ebook servers were working, downgraded Calibre and DeDRM to fix the Mac glitch with Kindle 1.31.0 where the DRM keys weren‚Äôt passed to the new install, then upgraded them so I can make DRM-free backups of my purchases again, ignored the crypto-markets because they were [depressing](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression"), worked on the impossible family jigsaw puzzle that will be the death of me before sickness ever takes me out, read a lot of books, and laid down inbetween each task to recouperate.

What‚Äôs funny is that what I ***want*** to do is vastly different from that list I just shared with you, but I simply can‚Äôt exercise or do PT yet. I can‚Äôt write as long as I can tinker. I run out of stamina. Same problem with studying Japanese. Or blogging. I wonder why tinkering on my computers is easy, but working on them is hard?

I believe the reason is that I forget to take breaks when I work, but tinkering is intellectual pudding, effortless for me to do, and I take frequent breaks in between tasks. You‚Äôd think I‚Äôd set a timer and work in small blocks when working. You know? The Pomodoro method? Ten minute increments? I‚Äôve been so exhausted from these oxygen-depleting coughing attacks that come up from the bottom of my toes, I‚Äôve forgotten most of my coping strategies.

So I‚Äôm typing all this here to remind myself.

I haven‚Äôt gone into details on what I‚Äôve been dealing with this year, but let‚Äôs just say that I ate my Thanksgiving dinner quarantined in my bedroom, so this current bout of illness has me a bit down. I just want to get back in shape, socialize with people more, and ride my longboard for hours like I did last year several times a week. But it‚Äôs December, we‚Äôre in a pandemic, Omicron is around the corner, and even though my knee PT has been delayed due to my car accident and COVID‚Äì19 (and now RSV), I couldn‚Äôt go longboarding in this weather anyway. If I owned a gun, I would put pictures of viruses on a post in my backyard and shoot at them all day until I felt better.

It‚Äôs possible that I‚Äôm in a dark place. Now that I‚Äôve vented, I believe I will post something positive every day this week until I lift my spirits.

Here we go. Positive thought No.1: I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not dead.

Nope. Not positive enough. It sounds more like a lyric from the Smith‚Äôs than an empowering statement of gratitude. I‚Äôm sure I can do better.

Ahem.

**I‚Äôm grateful for a bright mind and geeky things to keep it entertained.**

There! That was better, don‚Äôt you think? What are you grateful for?

~DÀ¢

## Good Grief! Where Have I Been All This Time‚ÄΩ

*My life was briefly put on hold, thanks to a certain virus, but now I‚Äôm back, more cheeky & cynical than ever!*

![Orange-tinted Sunset](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/Orange-tintedSunset.jpg "Orange-tinted Sunset")

So much for new beginnings.

A week after my knee surgery, just as I was able to feel more human than sore, I became sick. Then sicker. Then sicker still. A quick visit to the InstaCare on a quiet Sunday evening ushered me into my new life of exhaustion and fatigue.

I‚Äôve had five or six COVID‚Äì19 tests since the pandemic began. They were almost beginning to feel routine. That Sunday night was no different. I showed up to pick up my pre-registered self-test, then opted to be seen instead because I felt lousy. I didn‚Äôt think I had COVID‚Äì19 because I was vaccinated, but I had something. I thought it was strep throat.

I waited outside. They called me in when they were wearing their biohazard suit. I had my vitals recorded. They decided to test for Strep as well as COVID‚Äì19. I waited some more.

I‚Äôve been there before. Multiple times doctors would tell me, ‚ÄúOh, 85% I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve got COVID‚Äù, and I‚Äôd test negative. Every time. They just didn‚Äôt understand how sick I get. Respiratory illness is my raison d‚Äô√™tre . A virus only has to pass by the front of my home on the other side of the street, and I‚Äôll be bedridden for a week. I‚Äôd made progress in recent years. I‚Äôd enjoyed traveling, longboarding, and shrugging off colds after a day, but the pandemic made me unhealthier. I couldn‚Äôt get out. Couldn‚Äôt exercise. It was as if the pandemic lay on my [Major Depression Disorder](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression") like an anvil, then pushed my [Persistent Depression Disorder](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression") down the stairs. It helped my sleep phase disorder knock me around the clock like a hockey puck. I was back to be being sick more often than healthy again.

When the test came back positive for SARS-CoV‚Äì2, I was irritated. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon!‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúI followed all the rules. I wore that stupid mask. I got my shots!‚Äù Yeah, but Delta didn‚Äôt care. From what I‚Äôve read, it had a different protein spike than the one American vaccines targeted.

Delta‚Äôs path to me was logjammed with vaccines, all of which it vaulted over grimly and with grace. Apparently, my brother‚Äôs mother-in-law went to a party, came home and gave Delta to her husband. Then they waited to get better because they couldn‚Äôt possibly have COVID‚Äì19. They were vaccinated! Everyone says get vaccinated or you‚Äôll endanger your grandparents, as if the vaccine is a magical potion that wards off evil, but the grandparents ended up sharing the virus with their eleven-year-old grandson, who then shared it with his daddy, who then shared it with me. All of us except my nephew were vaccinated‚Äîtwice.

Can I be dramatic for a moment (as if I wasn‚Äôt already over the top). I‚Äôd never been sicker in my life. It was like pneumonia and the flu had a baby in my lungs then beat me down with its diapers. I‚Äôve been bronchial all my life, but I‚Äôd never experienced anything like this. Even watching TV or reading a book took too much energy. I was miserable. Getting air into my lungs was exhausting at times. COVID‚Äì19 weaponized my comorbid conditions, then waged war on my health. With the time recovering from surgery followed with COVID‚Äì19, I‚Äôve lost five weeks of my life. Fun times.

Now that I‚Äôm on the mend, I‚Äôve begun taking back my life, putting out fires, getting things back on track‚Ä¶and sleeping at all the wrong times of the day when I collapse, battery depleted. Things couldn‚Äôt be worse if radioactive meteors began to rain down upon me every time I ventured out to check the mail.

Don‚Äôt worry, though. My spirits are up even considering all I‚Äôve been through. [Being melodramatic is all part of my therapy.](http://douglascootey.com/2006/03/depression-ten-ways-to-fight-it-off.html "Here's how I fight off Depression without meds") Next time I‚Äôll tell you about my comical trip to the ER for the monoclonal antibody treatment. Being in danger of a heart attack was never so hilarious. Just make sure you have ‚ÄúYakety Sax‚Äù playing in the background while you read along.

In the meantime, I hope you enjoyed the first sunset that I beheld in ages, venturing outside on my own for the first time since this whole ordeal began.

## What Gets You Down?

*Sometimes external forces can induce depression. They can induce panic. They can control how you see the world if you let them.*

![](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/cryptocrash.jpg "The crypto market-all red-all going down")

I‚Äôve got surgery coming up this week, so I‚Äôm getting my blogging in early. I want to work on my current novel when I start to come out of the anesthesia. We‚Äôll see how that goes. In the meantime, I‚Äôm watching the crypto market implode‚Ä¶again.

I decided to get into crypto last Spring‚Äîtwo days before China cracked down on Bitcoin miners and the Chinese banks that did business with them. I had only invested $10. It was play money, to be honest, but what a lesson that was for me! China‚Äôs crackdown caused the market to crash. That $10 became negative in just two days.

I laughed. There I was. Mr. Moneybags. The Crypto Guru. All because I was so entertained just twenty-four hours earlier when my $10 had gained 50¬¢ in value.

The main character of my book made and lost a fortune in crypto, so I wanted to understand that world better before writing about it. He lost his business. He lost his girl. He lost his charm, optimism, and self-respect. He was destroyed in a week. It wasn‚Äôt my goal to lose my $10 bucks. I don‚Äôt need to write ***that*** authoritatively! However, I did feel that some background knowledge would make me write a more realistic character.

They say that the cryptocurrency market is volatile. Saying that is like saying the sun is somewhat warm. Since Spring I have seen the crypto market crash three times. It‚Äôs doing so again right now. It will probably be up again sometime after my surgery, but for the moment it is leaving a trail of blood all the way to the floor. The common internet advice is to ‚Äúbuy the dip‚Äù, which means buy during the crash. I‚Äôm not in a position to do that. I‚Äôm better off focusing on paying off my medical bills. Besides, sometimes dips have dips, too.

![](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/dippymeme.jpg "Losing at the dip image")

Though minuscule, watching my investment shrivel last Spring wasn‚Äôt a happy feeling, but I was [insulated from the depression](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression") and panic many people experienced when their investments went South because I hadn‚Äôt invested very much, but also because I had already prepared to potentially lose it all.

Which made me wonder how people actually lost money on the stock market. As long as the market goes back up, I haven‚Äôt lost anything. I‚Äôd have to sell at a loss to lose my investment. As part of my book research, I talked to family members who had lost money in the stock market crash in 2008. With my newfound knowledge, it seemed the only way they could lose anything is if they sold low‚Äîwhich is exactly what they did. They sold for fear that getting something was better than getting nothing.

Panic & depression cause us to make very emotional decisions. Our worldview is skewed darkly as we envision nothing by doom. For me, my investment in crypto wasn‚Äôt meant to make me rich, so I wasn‚Äôt emotionally impacted by the dips. However, I mused that there were many other external forces that caused me to panic and be depressed aplenty.

This time I don‚Äôt have a succinctly numbered list of advice for you. I‚Äôm still formulating ideas. One thing I can say is that the trick to not becoming depressed by external forces is to separate your mind from the events that are impacting you. Personally speaking, I have to decide that those external forces don‚Äôt impact me at all. Just as the ups and downs of the crypto market don‚Äôt affect my self-worth, I need to ensure that the ups and downs in my life don‚Äôt affect my self-worth either.

My entire [book on fighting suicide](http://douglascootey.com/2016/01/saying-no-to-suicide-by-douglas-r-cootey.html "Saying NO to Suicide") was based on the idea that there is always a dawn. Improving our perspective through discipline is a very appealing thought process to me. I am grateful for the second crypto crash this month for reminding me of this lost lesson‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

## Finding the Beauty in Chaos

*A new beginning that looks an awful lot like the old one.*

![](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/IMG_1643.PNG "Beauty in Chaos. Bronze fractal filaments over a blue background")

When I set out to explore fractal art, I face a confusing array of controls & parameters. It has taken me years to develop the eye to select the best cropping, the most flattering palette, and the most interesting settings, then present them in a pleasing manner. Without this discipline, the fractal is an utter mess with no focus. By making a few poorly chosen decisions, the same mathematical location and the same color palette can appear completely different‚Äîand far less appealing.

![](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/IMG_1642.PNG "Chaos instead of beauty. The frequency of the palette is too high, creating a busy image with no focus or serenity.")

Of course, anybody with the time and desire to learn the software can produce pleasing images. It isn‚Äôt as if I received a PhD in advance fractal art, traveling to distant lands to study with the Mandelbrot masters before writing my doctoral thesis on the societal implications of sliders versus number fields and how they subvert the patriarchy.

However, as I was exploring a particular fractal set the other day,‚Äîtweaking the parameters to get something beautiful to leap out of the screen‚ÄîI had an interesting thought that caused me to stop and ponder:

> I wish my life was as easy to organize as these fractals are.

There is too much chaos to detail here, but suffice it to say that my life is more like the bottom image with its cacophony of line and color, overwhelmed with indiscernible patterns. It feels like absolute and total chaos, and I‚Äôm not pleased about it one single pixel.

I sat there wondering what my slider controls were. What could I tweak to bring my life back into focus? Was it as simple as choosing a new palette, in other words, changing the scenery? How could I pacify the waves of chaos that seemed to be carrying me far from my goals? Oh, I self-pontificated grandly, assigning various aspects of my life as metaphorical tools in my fractal art program. After a few minutes of that, though, I realized it was all a bit silly. There is no ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù dial in my life to reduce the amount of chaos.

But if there could be such a dial, what would it look like? How would I use it? Would I want to?

Since the pandemic, my family life has become complicated. [I don‚Äôt write as much as I‚Äôd like.](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Writing "Sometimes I actually write about my book projects and progress") I don‚Äôt draw or play instruments anymore. It seems that I am entirely preoccupied dealing with my disabilities as well as those of my daughter. I must admit that I am thoroughly depressed, [my ADHD is not being managed well](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD"), and my Tourette‚Äôs is running my life. Although I am not lying down, playing the victim, I am so busy surviving that I am giving no consideration to thriving.

Instead of being knocked around by life, I want to choose the direction. Recording my thoughts on social media has long lost its charm. I want to thrive. It‚Äôs not enough to tread water. We only tire ourselves out that way. Instead, we need a clear direction to head in.

Since I‚Äôm still living out in the fractal weeds, so to speak, that clear direction that I want in my life is obscured by chaos. I‚Äôve decided to record my thoughts as I work through the process. ocial media has lost much of its appeal for me, yet blogging has also lost its appeal. I began to worry too much about each article being quotable, SEO-optimized, and shared. So I‚Äôve begun a new journal instead, then post the pages here. I‚Äôll try to get back to my roots to when I began blogging, offering more personal observations.

I will discuss my process more, [working through my ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD "Read more tips on managing ADHD"), [depression](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression"), [Tourette‚Äôs](http://douglascootey.com/search?q=Tourettes), and family life as obstacles. It‚Äôll be more like my old [Writing in a Fishbowl](http://douglascootey.com/search?q=writing+fishbowl) series, but I will try to be less colloquial and more beautiful in the way that I write. Finding beauty in chaos starts with me. I need to highlight the good in my life and emphasize my progress.

I hope you won‚Äôt mind coming along for the ride. There are some beautiful sights to behold. They may have even been right in front of my face, but I missed them because I was focused on the chaos instead.

## Feedburner Is Dying. I'm Moving Email Subscriptions to Follow.it

![(cc) Douglas Cootey](http://www.cootey.com/weblog/pix/2006/2006-03-07_BrainFree.jpg "(cc) Douglas Cootey")

Feedburner is being put to pasture by Google, so I have moved my Feedblitz email subscribers over to [follow.it](https://follow.it/asplinteredmind?action=followPub). Thank you for understanding.¬†

My original RSS URL is sixteen years old, back from when I called this blog ***THE*** Splintered Mind, long before I discovered that early blog indexers alphabetized their listings without ignoring determiners like "a" or "the". So ***A*** Splintered Mind was born, and suddenly I was at the top of the lists. Yep, I was sneaky.¬†

Then I discovered Feedburner which allowed me to track stats and such on the people who subscribed. Feedburner took the old RSS feed and gave you a new one to share with readers that made their magic work. Now Google's shelving the magic. Bad news for me, but not bad news for you.

Feedburner for end users will hang around for an indeterminate amount of time according to Google. You should be able to continue accessing all your feedburner based RSS feeds in whatever RSS reader you still use. That means you'll continue to receive updates from this blog. However, Google giveth and Google taketh away. I wouldn't trust them for long. It's time to update your feedburner branded RSS feeds. This link should do the trick:

It's also time for me to move this blog to another platform, so I'll be planning my migration in earnest now. I suspect that Blogger will be on the chopping block one day soon. I'm looking into self-hosting solutions, just for your information, but whatever I elect to do will be much better than this tired old Blogger platform. We've had a lot of fun here, though. Thanks for your continued support.

## Patience for Those Who Grieve

![Anger, Grief & Pain ¬© Douglas Cootey](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/anger-grief-pain.gif "Anger, Grief & Pain ¬© Douglas Cootey")

> ‚ùùMy son fricken tried to commit suicide, so I had to drive all the way over there to deal with it.

A few months ago, I pulled up to the one remaining branch in my area that US Bank allowed to be open during the pandemic and tentatively approached the entrance. I had banking to do, but they had bizarrely limited hours and, of course, they were closed. So I entered the ATM area and began my bank transfers with hundreds of dollars tight to my chest, hoping nobody would come in and rob me blind while I was feeding the money into the ATM.

As I was doing my banking in the comfort of their ATM fishbowl, a woman entered behind me. I made some polite comment about how I was almost done, and that magically opened up a flood of information from her that I never would‚Äôve expected. Strangers usually don‚Äôt open up to each other, especially about the subject that she was dealing with. The quote above is the choicest one that she shared with me. I remember thinking at the time how callous and insensitive she was. I prayed that her son would find the support that he needed during his struggle with [surviving suicide](http://douglascootey.com/search?q=suicide+or+suicidal "Read more about how suicide can be overcome").

Recently, a family in my neighborhood suddenly dealt with the death of a son. His family went on vacation without him and came home to find a surprise. It was a traumatic event since the children were there, I believe, when they found his body, and the whole family is struggling with anger, shame, and survivor‚Äôs guilt. As usual, many family members will not talk about it. Suicide is the death act that shall not be discussed. It is taboo. Meanwhile, other family members openly discuss it on Facebook, angering or hurting those who want to keep the matter private. It seems older generations are more reluctant to acknowledge suicide than the younger generations who wish to discuss it openly.

At first, I presumed that my banking friend fell in with the older generation, but she discussed her son‚Äôs suicide attempt openly, though with contempt. I couldn‚Äôt tell if she was callous because she was a heartless mother, or if she was in shock and angry. I don‚Äôt read minds.

When I was dealing with that stranger, I was trying to stay polite in the onslaught of her anger. Her unsympathetic comments seemed inappropriate and unwarranted. I was just somebody she was venting at. Personally, I didn‚Äôt appreciate it at the time, but now I wonder how alone she must have felt to open up and vent her feelings to an absolute stranger. Having struggled with suicidal ideation off and on in my life, I would like to think that my family will not be griping to strangers about me if I should ever stray. However, having dealt with people who survived a loved one‚Äôs suicide, I realize that grief transforms rational people into raw nerves. I do try not to judge.

My advice is two-fold since there are two issues being dealt with here.

1.  If you encounter somebody who is grieving over the suicidal death of a loved one, you need to be compassionate even if you disapprove of their method of grief. Grief is very personal, so be patient and allow them to grieve initially however they need to. They will run through a spectrum of emotions, and it is not your place to police those emotions, especially within the raw hours following the bad news. Try to resist the urge to correct their thinking while they are doing nothing but feeling. In the days to follow, there will come a moment when the rage or grief will abate, and then they can receive your suggestions for better, [more constructive methods of dealing with their pain and depression](http://douglascootey.com/2006/03/depression-ten-ways-to-fight-it-off.html "Here's how I fight off Depression without meds").
2.  If you are the one grieving over the suicidal death of a loved one, you might not want to open up to a stranger at the ATM. It is imperative that you find people you feel safe talking to. You shouldn‚Äôt bottle your feelings up, or bury them deep inside in order to ‚Äúbe strong‚Äù. Being strong is being in touch with your feelings which will give you the strength to help those who are struggling with theirs. Avoid negative friends or family members who feel compelled to force their viewpoints on you. Lastly, don‚Äôt decide for others when they have grieved long enough.

I‚Äôm not sure what I can do to help the family in my neighborhood. I‚Äôm not extremely close with them. They have not turned to me for comfort. It‚Äôs not my place to shoehorn my way into their life, but I am sure I can find some way to serve them without intruding. Mostly, I am glad that I did not lose my patience with that outwardly hard-hearted mother. It is possible that I saw the reason why the young lad tried to end his life. Perhaps she isn‚Äôt a very good person. However, if she dumped her frustrations and darkness on me instead of family members, then I‚Äôll consider that my good deed for the grieving family.

I wrote a book a few years back that has advice on how to deal with suicide. [You might find it helpful.](http://douglascootey.com/2016/01/saying-no-to-suicide-by-douglas-r-cootey.html "Saying NO to Suicide")

## Depression: Five Throw-Away Journal Ideas You Write in Secret

*Sometimes the best kind of journal is the one that you shred, light on fire, then cast its ashes to the wind.*

![Throw-Away iPad](http://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/Throw-Away-iPad.jpg "Throw-Away iPad")

Last January, I woke up severely depressed one morning. At first, I didn‚Äôt realize what was happening. I just knew that I had no will to move, no will to eat, no will to do anything. ***I felt interred with heavy, suffocating sadness.***

Mmm, that sounds rather dramatic, doesn‚Äôt it?

The moment I realized I was depressed, I grabbed my iPhone and began dictating a blog entry to Siri as a coping strategy. However, it was all in the same vein as that emo sentence above‚Äînice and juicy with just the right amount of adverbial angst and self-indulgence. We should all be grateful that I deleted every single word of it.

Normally, I avoid blogging or posting on social media while under the influence of [Major Depressive Disorder](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression"). Despite my efforts to sound upbeat, depression affects my narrative voice and mental outlook. Fortunately, hindsight gained from experience keeps me from embarrassing myself online. I tend to write only when I have a handle on my emotions. Otherwise, my writing would become a morbid dance that leans towards the theatrical, like graves dancing in the rain.

That morning, however, I wasn‚Äôt worried about the need to self-edit. I had an urge to express my fathomless despair. I wouldn‚Äôt dream of sharing that private, turgid moment of maudlin, morning, mopey malaise with others.

Okeh, okeh‚Ä¶I‚Äôll stop with the purple prose!.

The abandoned journal entry did serve a therapeutic purpose, however. It was so over the top, I laughed, which lifted my spirits immensely. As I deleted the colorful journal entry, I realized that sometimes my first blog drafts are just as cheesy. I wonder why I never noticed the similarity to throw-away journals[¬π](http://douglascootey.com/2022/09/adhd-brain-fog-is-no-laughing-matter.html#fn:1 "see footnote") before.

The temporary, throw-away journal is a fantastic coping strategy for when you need to purge your feelings but don‚Äôt necessarily want to share them with anybody. One of the worst things you can do for yourself when you‚Äôre depressed is to bottle up your emotions. Those dark and toxic feelings tend to bounce around in our head, building up momentum and importance. When I am emotionally agitated, keeping ideas to myself is the quickest way towards blowing things out of proportion.

Although I‚Äôve talked before about [the importance of support networks](http://douglascootey.com/2020/05/give-yourself-fighting-chance-put.html), sometimes I don‚Äôt want to share these dark feelings with anybody. They‚Äôre too personal and often a wee bit self-indulgent. Long ago, I decided that burdening a family member or friend with that potent prose was a bad idea. Instead, I express myself into a journal I have no intention of keeping. I can be as ***turgidly maudlin*** as I want. Sometimes, the temporary journal helps me vent the worst of my feelings so that I don‚Äôt overburden my support network when I reach out to them afterwards.

Here are five temporary journal ideas for when you need to vent or work through your feelings before talking to somebody:.

1.  **Write a letter to yourself, then crumple and throw it away after you‚Äôre done:** By purging negative emotions in a creative and constructive way, we can prevent things from becoming more complicated in real life. This strategy has the presidential endorsement of Abraham Lincoln. Fireplace not required.
2.  **Tap a letter to yourself, then delete it:** We can be commuting, surrounded by people, and still vent into a notefile without anyone being the wiser. I would probably advice against using this technique where your boss or coworkers could look over your shoulder. You may also not want them to know about your mental health issues.
3.  **Dictate to your phone, then delete it:** It can be very helpful to just speak your feelings sometimes. You gain the benefit of feeling like you‚Äôre talking to somebody while also expressing yourself via voice if typing isn‚Äôt your thing.
4.  **Record a voice memo, then delete it:** If transcription errors make your note unintelligible, you could use a voice recorder or your phone to record instead. Get all of your feelings out, then delete them. It‚Äôs very therapeutic.
5.  **Make a fake phone call:** When I‚Äôm extremely agitated, and there‚Äôs no one to talk to in my support network, I‚Äôll go for a walk and pretend that I‚Äôm on the phone. With earpiece in ear, you can walk down the street while talking out loud praying, dictating a note, recording a voice memo, or just talking to yourself and no one will think anything of it. Be careful of who is nearby because voices carry.

Although my depression did not magically go away that morning, I was able to lighten the depth of it, which allowed me to get out of bed, eat, get myself dressed, and move on with my day. I didn‚Äôt take to social media and embarrass myself with a self-pitying plea for sympathy or post that purple pile on my blog. I love journal writing, and I have a dozen or so volumes tucked away in boxes, but I don‚Äôt want every moment to be preserved for posterity. Sometimes, I just need to vent‚Äîmaybe even wallow‚Äîuntil I‚Äôm ready to let it go. Those moments are private. That‚Äôs why I like to delete them. Hopefully, you‚Äôll find these suggestions helpful when you have a bad day of your own.

## Depression ‚Äì Breaking Out of the Cocoon and Thinking You've Failed

*Sometimes we can be so fixated upon the finish line that we miss how far we‚Äôve already come.*

[![Backlit cocoon of an emperor moth](https://www.cootey.com/pix/2021/backlitcocoon.jpg "Backlit cocoon of an emperor moth")](https://alanwatsonfeatherstone.com/a-day-in-inchvuilt-wood/)  
¬© Alan Watson Featherstone

Ah, if I hear another commercial on the radio with a smooth-talking announcer earnestly pretending their company cares about me during these ‚Äúunprecedented times‚Äù, I may puke. I‚Äôve moved way beyond that acid reflux-ish moment where my stomach‚Äôs contents race to my mouth to voice their opinion. I may not be able to hold them back next time. Between you and me, I‚Äôm a little worried about it. I‚Äôm still making payments on my car.

So I‚Äôm not going to talk to you as if you just woke up next to Rip Van Winkle and need me to explain what COVID‚Äì19 is. I‚Äôm just going to write from my heart about how this pandemic has affected me, and maybe you‚Äôll be able to relate:

## I Feel like My Life Has Been Sealed in a Cocoon

This is a funny thing to write because I‚Äôve never before been so productive in my life. No, the **BIG** goals like publishing my new books haven‚Äôt been accomplished yet, but I‚Äôm paying off debts, I successfully swam through oceans of paperwork and petitioned for guardianship of my disabled daughter, I‚Äôm the fittest I‚Äôve ever been in my adult life, I‚Äôm dating again (which means I occasionally leave my home), people pay me to write for some reason, and I have raised four lovely daughters.

But life feels like it‚Äôs on hold. Some of that is the pandemic‚Äôs fault. After all, who gets happy in a lockdown? However, in this case the pandemic only added to an already crushing situation. I haven‚Äôt had such a bleak, hopeless Winter since my divorce nine years ago. What happened to [my coping strategies?](http://douglascootey.com/2006/03/depression-ten-ways-to-fight-it-off.html "Here's how I fight off Depression without meds") What happened to my fighting spirit?

Consider this. I‚Äôve just had the healthiest Winter in forever. I cannot recall a year in decades where I didn‚Äôt spend weeks sick in bed during the Winter. However, this time I only experienced four colds at most, and each one was over within a day. Talk about unprecedented times! I‚Äôm never this healthy. The diagnosis of asthma, the meds to treat it, and the new coping strategies I employ to keep myself healthy have all turned my world around. This was thanks to my consistent, proactive efforts to solve my health issues despite being sick.

But do I focus on that in my head? Why would I? I haven‚Äôt published my new book yet. I haven‚Äôt lost ALL my weight yet. I‚Äôm not married. Loser! *Wait, what?*

I should be ecstatic. I should be happier than those models you see in bank advertisements who are ***so excited*** to be in debt, their smiles wrap fully around their heads. The reality is that my life isn‚Äôt so bad, even without a 360¬™ smile. I‚Äôm incredibly blessed. What‚Äôs to be depressed about‚ÄΩ

Yet each one of the complaints I fixated on sat upon my chest like an elephant of disappointment. I could barely move. While I lay there focusing on my burdensome list of failures, I wasn‚Äôt focusing on the good that I had accomplished, nor was I benefiting from the rewards. I was disavowing them instead because *‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt done enough‚Äù*. I understand that depression doesn‚Äôt need a reason to lay waste to happiness, but my errors in thought weren‚Äôt helping.

How thankful I am that Spring came early for a spell. I got outside finally. I jumped on my longboard as often as I could and cruised around in the sun, talked with strangers, smiled a little, and felt good about myself. When Spring snubbed Summer and passed the baton on to Fall, however, my mood began to sink. That‚Äôs when I noticed what I was doing to myself. Was I really allowing the weather to determine my mood? Well, it‚Äôs more complicated than that. I have [major depression disorder](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression") and [persistent depression disorder](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression"). I don‚Äôt need an overcast day with chilly rain to get me depressed. However, I certainly was allowing weather to dictate my coping strategies.

I had let my guard down. During all those months locked away from others, I began to see my goals as the only way of measuring my progress‚Äîwhich can usually be quite efficient‚Äîbut there is a serious downside if you link that progress to your self-worth. No progress = no self-esteem. In essence, if you fail to do something unrealistic in an impossible amount of time, you are ensuring your own ego‚Äôs self-destruction. Those warm Spring days were a distraction‚Äîan outlier‚Äîbut once they faded I realized that I had allowed success to determine my self-esteem again.

As you start to come out of your pandemic cocoons, keep in mind your coping strategies and don‚Äôt ride yourself too hard. You may have lost valuable time in a lockdown stupor, but, as I remind myself, just because it seems dark, that doesn‚Äôt mean that tomorrow will be dark as well. The sun always rises. Well, unless it‚Äôs running around with Summer right now.

## Is Suicide Preventable? (Short Answer: YES)

As I wind up my latest book project, I thought it might be a good time to share an interview of sorts I did a few months ago. I was asked to answer the question ‚ÄúIs suicide preventable?‚Äù in three sentences. Can such a question be answered in three sentences‚ÄΩ Actually, it can be answered with one word: Yes. I elaborated on that word with three sentences that I hope are helpful to somebody.

Fortunately, the rest of the article was a bit longer, so there is plenty for you to read. Kate Haldeman tackled some of the typical stigmas of which depressives encounter. People mean well, but sometimes their advice does more harm than good. Ms. Haldeman addressed every negative word of ‚Äúencouragement‚Äù you could imagine, from telling people to ‚Äúget over it‚Äù to telling depressives to work harder at being happy. I liked her alternative questions. I hope that people who need to learn these tips find her article.

There is no perfect way to respond to everybody‚Äôs depression. Each response needs to be tailored to the individual. For example, I don‚Äôt mind the concept that we have to work hard to be happy, but words have nuances. Telling somebody they have to work hardER at being happy is a judgement on their efforts. You can commiserate that it is hard work being happy, or that we must work hard to be happy because [depression robs us of our quality of life](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/Depression "Read more about coping with Depression"), but to command a depressive to work harder at being happy, even in jest, is to dismiss their struggle offhandedly. Would you tell somebody with a broken ankle to try harder to run? No, of course not. You would find a way to assist them. Mental health is no different.

I know a former bishop of mine who will ask me how I‚Äôm doing when we bump into each other around town, and when I tell him about my blog or book successes, he‚Äôll either change the subject or tell me I need to stop letting my disability define me. I‚Äôm sure he means well, but since I don‚Äôt recall him ever taking time to find out how my disability affected me in the first place, his advice is useless to me. Ms. Haldeman‚Äôs article tackles this kind of misfire in her article, [‚Äú7 Things People Don‚Äôt Understand About Depression‚Äù](https://mindandthegap.com/7-things-people-dont-understand-about-depression/). I invite you to give it a read.

## Top Mental Health Blogs for 2020‚Äîthe Bestest Year EVER

[![](https://www.cootey.com/pix/2020/twinkl2020.png "A great list of mental health blogs")](https://www.twinkl.com/blog/top-mental-health-blogs-2020?fbclid=IwAR1HrXZnmvQ8h8aXUqcbrAaOy_RYto6B2FXGo-y4-rT1OPf0zcBLxvOOaSI)All was not terrible in 2020.¬†

The press will try to convince you otherwise, but their job is to panic you into thinking the world is ending any minute‚Ä¶again‚Ä¶so that you click on their news links to help them make money. I'm sure your personal life is filled with happy events that spit in the eye of Cynicism 2020. In fact, I'm positive I can rattle off dozens of such events in my own personal life. For example, my ex and I successfully gained guardianship over our learning disabled daughter. Pretty good, huh? I filed pro se, and the hearing went without a hitch. Take that, [ADHD](http://douglascootey.com/search/label/ADHD)! I sold another article to ADDitude Magazine. Huzzah! I successfully learned to do the 180¬∫ cross-step on my longboard while carving. Well, that was important to me even if it seems obscure. I've only been practicing for three years. Oh! There was that time I crossed the street without getting hit by a car. That was a big event in 2020. And those monoliths from space aliens planted in my Utahn backyard? That turned out to be a PR stunt. Huh, that wasn't so exciting after all, but the local BLM and news reporters sure made us laugh. Um‚Ä¶ I lowered my blood pressure? I dropped down to a 36" waist‚Äîthen climbed back up to 38" with pandemic pounds? My plants haven't died?

This is tough. Maybe 2020 really wasn't such an exciting year, after all.

On the upside, however, I won another blog award. Don't roll your eyes! This is great news for you because I can now point you to other blogs much better than mine. Merry Christmas! You're welcome!

British education site Twinkl reached out to me with the good news in September‚Äîright when I was in quarantine‚Äîor maybe I was just sick? I don't know. September was a long time ago. But I promised to share the news with my blog readers and here we are! It's only four months later, right‚∏Æ¬†This time there was only one other blogger I recognized (Hi,¬†[Natasha](https://natashatracy.com/)!), so I'm excited to look over the list as well.

## ADHD: ToDo Tabs Done Right

![ToDo Tabs Mania](https://www.cootey.com/pix/2020/ToDoTabsMania.png "ToDo Tabs Mania")

Sometimes I wonder if there‚Äôs a support group out there for adults with ADHD who have an open tabs addiction.[¬π](http://douglascootey.com/2022/09/adhd-brain-fog-is-no-laughing-matter.html#fn:1 "see footnote")

*Hello, my name is Douglas Cootey, and I‚Äôm a hard core tabs junkie.*

Maybe this seems like a first world problem. Maybe you‚Äôre asking yourself, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the big deal with several hundred open tabs?‚Äù If that‚Äôs how you think, you might need to join me at that meeting.

In theory there‚Äôs nothing wrong with lots of open browser tabs. I did things that way for years. If I found a web page with a great project or article I wanted to refer to later, I‚Äôd keep the tab open and leave it with the other saved ToDo tabs. The problem I ran into, however, was although ToDo tabs helped me not forget important data, I had so many tabs open in my browser I couldn‚Äôt find what I needed.

Just as ToDo lists can get long and unmanageable, ToDo tabs multiply until they become noise‚Äîno longer useful as resources or reminders. Yes, you‚Äôve got web pages open for that funny self-surgery with tweezers, fifty things to do with a used toilet paper roll, and The Astounding Link Between Lizard People and the Founding Fathers, but where are they?

Productivity takes a hit when our ADHD tendencies aren‚Äôt reined in for a simple reason: chaos means extra work. I once had so many tabs up, I kept researching the same material over and over again. I had forgotten the very same research was already available in two identical tabs. Other times, when I do manage to remember I saved something as a ToDo tab, I have to dig through dozens upon dozens of tabs to find where the web pages I want are hiding. Worst still, I might be distracted by an old tab while making my search. Open tabs can weigh on the mind. Many of them represent unfinished projects waiting to snare my attention. This is what happens when you keep *‚Äú31 Pumpkin Spice Recipes that Will Win Her Back‚Äù* lurking in the background. Instead of writing, I‚Äôm suddenly in the kitchen making pumpkin spice sushi rice.

What turned me around was when my learning disabled daughter hopped onto my open Mac and somehow reset all my tabs. I had three windows open with 20‚Äì30 tabs in each window. Yes, some of the tabs were a kind of wishlist on how I wanted to spend my time or money, but the majority were important research for my first book. I literally sounded like Luke Skywalker when he met a certain long-lost relative. All my research! Gone!

Fortunately, my hourly data backup allowed me to restore what was removed, but since that time I‚Äôve changed how I utilize ToDo tabs. If you‚Äôre as prone to distraction or wasting time on the internet as I am, you might find the following tips helpful:

1.  **Wipe the slate clean** ‚Äì I‚Äôm not going to lie. Deleting all your ToDo tabs and starting smart from scratch is the easiest solution. One time, after a long bout of illness, I discovered that I had 197 tabs open on my iPhone alone, never mind what I had on my iPad and Mac. There were multiple hundreds of ToDo tabs! Why did I have so many open tabs anyway? I simply didn‚Äôt have the time or energy to prune them all. I opted to wipe them all. It was amazing how liberating that felt.
2.  **Use a ‚Äúread later‚Äù app** ‚Äì Instead of loading dozens of news stories into tabs, I like to send articles I want to read later to Pocket, a read later service. Then the articles appear on my Kobo ereader for later perusal, but they can appear just as easily in the Pocket app on my iPhone or iPad. Kindle users can use Instapaper for that purpose, too. Read all your news later, leaving no open tabs in your browser to distract you or clutter up your work environment. The downside is that you will still have to eventually prune them afterwards in Pocket or Instapaper.
3.  **Browse in Privacy Mode** ‚Äì One way to reduce open tabs is to separate your productivity web browsing from your break time browsing. I developed the habit to browse in privacy mode when reading news. I realize that privacy mode is usually used for hinky sites you don‚Äôt want anybody but your ISP to know about, but you can use this feature for other purposes. I prefer to use the Brave browser for this purpose. It never saves privacy tabs. Once I shut off privacy, the tabs all go bye-bye. This is perfect for cruising around the web on a whim, but leaves nothing to clean up later no matter how many tabs I opened up. You can do the same thing in a new window just for breaktime. Then when you‚Äôre done, just close the window.
4.  **Segregate your ToDo tabs by window** ‚Äì To keep ToDo tabs from becoming cluttered, designate different browser windows for different purposes. News, work, research, fun‚Ä¶ Each window can have its own ToDo tabs. Personally, I found this method a bit too prone to abuse. I‚Äôd mix themes all the time and end up with five or more browser windows with dozens if not hundreds of tabs all in a jumble. However, if you‚Äôre disciplined, this method may work best for you.
5.  **Segregate your ToDo tabs by device** ‚Äì I need more austere ToDo tabs separation to fend off chaos. For this reason, I do my blog research on my iPhone. Writing research is left for my iPad. On my Mac‚Äôs browser, I keep only tabs that relate to my current project. Since I use iCloud, all bookmarks and pages are shared, so the segregation isn‚Äôt as hard core as it sounds because what I have open on one device is available on the other. Keeping a theme for each device helps me be more organized. In this way, ToDo tabs become very useful.
6.  **Segregate your ToDo tabs by browser** ‚Äì If using different devices to organize tabs seems too much work, you could use different browsers for your different ToDo tabs instead. This can help you manage the clutter and keep important pages from being buried in a wasteland of open tabs. When I was researching my Pok√©mon book a few years back, I did all my work in Chrome browser while keeping blog work in Safari. This made finding my research painless and productive. Segregating by browser or device is extra work at first, but once you get used to it, you will find the productivity benefits worth the effort.

My old ToDo tabs system was terribly inefficient, risky, and a drain on productivity, but now ToDo tabs have become a powerful tool at my fingertips. I have to admit that every once in a while I need a reminder lesson. About once a quarter I prune my ToDo tabs to make them easy to access, visually accessible, and useful again. My ToDo tabs and bookmarks are much more useful when I take time to prune and organize them. Since open tabs represent ToDo list items to me, each tab needs to be important and deserving of my time. Now that I manage them, I don‚Äôt need intervention or a support group anymore.
