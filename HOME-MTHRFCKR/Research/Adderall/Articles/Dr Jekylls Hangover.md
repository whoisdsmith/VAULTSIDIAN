# [Doctor Jekyll’s Hangover](http://quittingadderall.com/dr-jekylls-hangover/ "Permanent Link to Doctor Jekyll’s Hangover")

June 27th, 2012 by **Mike**

In the famous tale of _Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde_, Doctor Jekyll invents a potion that he thinks will give him super-human powers. After ingesting the potion, Dr. Jekyll discovers to his horror that the potion transforms him into a murderous monster named Hyde. Each night, the potion’s effects kick in, and the terrible Hyde rampages around the streets of London murdering innocent people and wreaking havoc.

The next morning, poor Dr. Jekyll (now himself again) wakes up in a strange location, his clothes torn to shreds, his hands covered in blood, and his mind flooded with memories of the destruction he has wrought the previous night as Hyde. These memories torture Dr. Jekyll, a noble man who would never commit the acts that the potion has caused him (as Hyde) to commit.

The person you were on Adderall is your own Hyde, a monster of great power and poor impulse control that has rampaged through your life over the last several years.

When you quit Adderall, you may find yourself in the position of poor, tormented Doctor Jekyll, overwhelmed by the mistakes you made while on Adderall and unable to reconcile them with the desires, values, and priorities of the more genuine person you have now become again.

This is a problem I’ve come to refer to as “Doctor Jekyll’s Hangover.”

## The 3 Phases of Dr. Jeckyll’s Hangover

### Phase 1: Blissful Ignorance

When you first quit Adderall, you’re so exhausted and barren of any definable sense of motivation or direction that you don’t really think about the past or the future. You’re only thinking about right now, and how much you’d rather be in bed.

### Phase 2: Gaining Clarity

After a month or two sober from Adderall, your head begins to clear. You can function a little bit better at work and in your daily life. The spiritual fog that surrounded you in your initial recovery period is starting to relent, and you begin to make out shapes in the mist. Some of these shapes are unsettling, some are pleasantly encouraging. Naturally, you walk towards the encouraging ones first, and ignore the unsettling ones.

I don’t know what those encouraging shapes in the mist look like for you. Maybe it’s a sudden urge to sketch some pencil artwork as you are taking notes in class, or maybe it’s a spontaneous Google search on a passion you haven’t thought about in years.

The point is that your new, sober self will be drawn naturally to certain directions that suit you far better than you might realize yet. Chasing these things that stir your passion will bring back your old self, and clear the haze from your heart.

But as that haze clears further, and as those encouraging shapes gain more detailed form, so too do the unsettling shapes in the mist begin to emerge with snarls and cries.

You cannot gain clarity about your future without simultaneously gaining clarity about your past, and that’s not always fun.

### Phase 3: Migraine Heartache

It’s been six months or a year since you quit Adderall, and there is now a deafening roar in your head comprised equally of demons tearing at you from your past, and angels beckoning from your future.

You’ve woken up from a long sleep and found yourself walking in a wasteland of your own making. It’s a twofold apocalypse for you: During the last several years on Adderall you’ve been making major decisions in a speed-induced manic state. Your Adderall-fueled Mr. Hyde has created a life that your sweet, noble Dr. Jekyll would never have wanted, and the few good things you managed to build while on Adderall crashed and burned during your initial recovery period (you know, those 3 months you spent lying on the couch).

You are overwhelmed with shame and remorse about how you’ve lived the last several years of your life, and devestated by the position you’ve left yourself in. You long to do it all over. To go back and really live from the start the way you’ve only started to live again recently.

You’re a new person now. You’ve got new goals and dreams and priorities. You’re more sensitive (to a fault), more genuine. You laugh more easily, when you’re not feeling depressed. You’ve started to see your friends and relationships in a kinder, gentler light. Because now they are all you have.

New passions have begun to blossom. You’re still working on them, but you like where this is headed. Deep down, it feels like a little voice is pushing you ownward, urging you to keep going, to stick with this new path and see it through a little while longer.

But you are having one hell of a time dealing with the guilt and shame of your past. It feels like every time you get a piece of your true self back, a new pain or regret about your past comes with it.

This intense regret feels like it will never end. You will never escape. You may even tell yourself that the best you can hope for is a kind of ironic personal hell that constantly reminds you of what you could have had, and what you pissed away.

But there is hope. As terrible and inescapable as they feel, hangovers do end.

**Examples of Common Dr. Jekyll’s Hangover Problems:  
**1. I want to go back to school, but I’ll be so far behind everyone else.  
2. I can see now how I should have handled my last relationship, but I’ve already ruined it.  
3. If I was cultivating my gifts instead of ignoring them all these years, I’d be amazing by now, instead of back where I started.

## The Five Steps to Curing your Dr. Jekyll’s Hangover

### 1. Atonement

Between your time on Adderall and your selfish, slovenly recovery period, you may have made some serious interpersonal errors and hurt people. If there are things you can address with a phone call or an uncomfortably-honest apology, do it. You will feel a zillion times better, you will stop obsessing about it, and you will be able to move on.

But of course, the real pain of Dr. Jekyll’s Hangover is caused by the mistakes you can’t take back.

### 2. Separation

When it comes to Adderall, there is more truth to the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde analogy than you might realize. You don’t just _feel_ like a different person on Adderall, you _are_ a different person in many quantifiable ways.

Imagine that you have created two clones of yourself. One clone is you on Adderall, and the other clone is you before you ever took Adderall. You’re sitting across the table from these two versions of yourself, and you start asking them questions: What do you want to do with your life? What is important to you right now? Where do you spend most of your time? What would your perfect man/woman be like?

Your two clones — we’ll call them Dr. Jekyll (normal, relaxed you) and Mr. Hyde (strung out on Adderall) — would give completely different answers to those questions. In fact, if you slid a comprehensive Meyers-Briggs Personality Type assessment test across the table and had each of your clones fill it out, they would likely come out as having significantly different MBTI personality types.

**Side note:** I’m not just theorizing about that MBTI type change. I’ve actually observed this in talking to people and through informal polls I’ve conducted on this site. Adderall users tend to score as more analytical Types while on Adderall, and more emotional Types when they’re sober. The most common Type scores are NT (conceptualizer, cold and mental) while on Adderall, and NF (idealist, warm and emotion-driven) after quitting. As in, people who take Adderall are often warm, emotional people who become cold and analytical on Adderall, and then rebound to their measurably more emotional natural personality after quitting.

Due to your kind nature, you will have a compulsion to shoulder the full weight of the mistakes you made while on Adderall… to see them as products of your own deep and irredeemable flaws, and to think of your current turmoil as your well-deserved personal hell.

But it’s not accurate for you to think that way. Dr. Jekyll’s sin wasn’t murdering people as Hyde; those were Hyde’s sins. Dr. Jekyll’s sin was creating Hyde. His only deep flaw was the short-sighted ambition that led him to first ingest that fateful potion. Everything that happened after that was just a consequence of that one error.

You may have created the monster, but you are not the same as the monster. The monster is Hyde. And Hyde is dead by your own hand. Long live the noble Dr. Jekyll.

### 3. Choosing an Open Path

First off, chase your passions. I can’t say that enough. Indulge every whisper of interest that your subconscious sends up to awareness. If something strikes a spark in your heart, pile wood and fuel on it and get it burning as hot and as loud as you can. Give that spark everything it needs to grow into a lasting flame. Chase it until it burns bright or dies out. That is the key to finding a new, happier life after Adderall.

But some mistakes have permanent consequences. It’s possible that you’ll quit Adderall and rediscover a direction that suits you brilliantly, only to find that it is forever closed to you now. You may upend your entire life to search for your lost dreams, only to find them dead and rotting in a mass grave, never to live again.

If that happens, you must adapt and keep moving forward. You may feel like no other path can give you as much fulfillment as that first one you found, but you can’t know the future. Only stagnation can truly kill you, so keep moving.

### 4. Moving ahead

As mentioned above, it’s crucial that you keep moving forward once you’ve regained some fraction of your ability to do so. No matter how grand or perfect your new dream is, it only matters if you actually start working to make it real. While it’s stuck in your head, it’s just a fantasy; [it’s just brain crack](http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2006/07/071106.html "Ze Frank: Brain Crack").

Monitor yourself. Don’t let yourself stew on an idea for too long without acting on it. Thinking and deciding is not the same thing as acting. Actions are things that other people could observe you doing. If somebody else was watching you today, what progress would they have seen you make towards your new goals?

### 5. Momentum

Imagine you are standing in front of a giant, stone wheel. That stone wheel is your new life, your new passions, and all your new hopes and dreams. The problem is: this giant stone wheel is standing still, and it weighs thousands of pounds. How are you going to get it moving?

You’re not strong enough to muscle it all at once. You tug and yank on it. You hang your whole body weight from it. Then you get tired and you rest for a while. Each day you tug at it. It still doesn’t move, but you get a little stronger. And one day the wheel starts to budge.

Maybe you even get it moving a little bit, and then you slip off and bust your ass. That can happen. The important thing is that you keep tugging that wheel every day, no matter what.

Because one day you’ll get it moving for a full rotation, and after that, if you keep pushing at it, the wheel will start building momentum.

#### A practical example

Let’s say you’ve decided after quitting Adderall that you want to be an artist (like, a painter). When you’re staring at a blank canvas for the first time in years, brush in hand, completely blocked up and feeling like you want to cry — that’s you staring at the giant stone wheel, wondering how you’re ever going to get it moving. When you make a few strokes with the brush, that’s you tugging at the wheel.

When you finish a few awesome paintings, call a gallery, get brutally rejected, and spend two weeks ignoring your painting and feeling like a failure — that’s you falling off the wheel and busting your ass.

When you’re half way done with your Masters in Art History, you’ve found a reliable way to sell your paintings, and you’ve got two new galleries asking you for samples — that’s you with momentum. You’re not having trouble moving the stone wheel anymore; now you’re just keeping it going, faster and faster.

And then one day you look back, and you can’t believe how far you’ve come. Your past mistakes don’t bother you as much anymore, because you’re so busy with your present successes. With each passing day, others see you (and you see yourself) for who you truly are, and always have been: The noble Dr. Jekyll, wisened by his mistakes, and more brilliant than ever.
