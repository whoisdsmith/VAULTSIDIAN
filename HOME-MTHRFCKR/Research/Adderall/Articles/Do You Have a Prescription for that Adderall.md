# What Is ADHD?

Although ADHD can be treated with appropriate medication, some people with ADHD continue to have problems with attention and the ability to be focused. A person’s symptoms could be genetics, medical problems, developmental problems, trauma, stressful life events, or environmental factors like diet, sleep, or stress.

Over time, children and young adults with ADHD may learn to cope better with their symptoms and function as successfully as non-ADHD individuals. Still, it’s essential to work with a qualified physician to get a diagnosis.
