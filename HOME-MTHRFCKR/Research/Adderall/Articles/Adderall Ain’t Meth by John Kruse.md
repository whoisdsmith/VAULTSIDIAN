Methamphetamine, amphetamine, methylphenidate….Aren’t they all just versions of the same thing? Although we classify these substances as stimulants, they produce different effects on brain chemistry, and influence behavior in divergent ways. My goal here is to explain why methamphetamine (meth, speed, crystal, ice) presents more danger and causes more damage to your brain than do the conventionally prescribed stimulants.

Even if you don’t have ADHD, or aren’t taking stimulants for other medicinal or for recreational purposes, knowledge about meth may be useful. As our [opioid epidemic appears to be waning, stimulant use and abuse are on the rise](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/deaths/other-drugs.html#anchor_1636144722012), just as stimulant epidemics have followed opioid epidemics previously in US history.

I don’t even drink coffee, yet meth abuse intruded into my life last month. Two years of meth binges rendered my schizophrenic neighbor even less in touch with reality, and [he shot and killed his seventy year old father](https://thebolditalic.com/a-killer-on-the-loose-seventy-miles-from-san-francisco-4a58bd3184e1). We’re likely to be hearing more stories like this as meth addiction proliferates.

## **Meh, what’s Meth anyway?**

If you feel confused in sorting out the stimulants, you’re not alone. That “meth-“ prefix can lead people astray. Several [rehab websites](https://wellnessretreatrecovery.com/speed-limit-similarities-adderall-use-meth-use/) that purport to explain how meth differs from amphetamine (Adderall, Vyvanse, and others) make basic errors in distinguishing between methamphetamine, amphetamine, and methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta and others). Cocaine, another stimulant, is even more chemically distinct from this triad.

An organic chemist will tell you that a methyl group is just a carbon atom with three hydrogens attached. Methamphetamine consists of amphetamine with the addition of one single methyl group. The enzymes in your body that eventually break down methamphetamine produce amphetamine as the first metabolite.

Both amphetamine and meth consist of a single, carbon-based ring, with a short chain branching from it. Meth’s short chain is just one carbon longer. Their more distant cousin, methylphenidate, incorporates an additional piperidine ring (composed of both carbon and nitrogen), onto the carbon-ring-short-chain structure.

So what difference can a measly little methyl group make? Well, let’s compare methanol, used for windshield wiper fluid and as a paint stripper, to methanol plus one additional methyl group. [A teaspoon of methanol can cause permanent blindness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5625597/); half a shot can kill you. That’s vastly different from methyl methanol, more commonly known as ethanol. That’s the alcohol found in beer, wine, and hard liquor!

Psychoactive drugs interact with complex three-dimensional receptor molecules, so even minor structural variations can render large differences in how these chemicals interact. The “rightt-handed” (dextroamphetamine, or D-amphetamine) and “left-handed” (levoamphetamine, or L-amphetamine) mirror images of the amphetamine molecule [produce different chemical and behavior effects in humans](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/why-is-vyvanse-so-popular-1dc3beb3aaf1).

Methamphetamine also exists in stereoisomeric D- and L- forms as well; meth consists of a mixture of equal amounts of D- and L-methamphetamine. In the next section, we will see how that added methyl group changes the action of meth compared to amphetamine.

## **Meth In the Brain**

Stimulants primarily affect three systems that regulate the flow of monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) within and between neurons: the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR), dopamine transporter (DT), and the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT).

TAAR usually moves dopamine into neurons, but in the presence of stimulants, it promotes the release of dopamine into the synaptic cleft. Within the neuron most of the dopamine doesn’t just randomly float around but is packed into synaptic vesicles by VMAT. Amphetamine and meth both increase the release of dopamine from these vesicles.

However, [meth causes about five times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631950/) as much dopamine to be released. Meth also helps dopamine to persist longer in the synaptic cleft. [Meth is more lipophyllic](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09595230801923702) (having a greater affinity for the fatty membranes of neurons and other cells) than amphetamine, resulting in quicker absorption. It also lingers longer because its closer immersion in cell membranes makes it harder to be degraded by metabolic machinery. Meth produces faster, bigger, longer, hits of dopamine than one gets from equivalent doses of amphetamine.

Amphetamine has a very weak impact on serotonin neurons. In contrast, meth has a strong affinity for and is toxic to, serotonin neurons.

As a class, moderate doses of [stimulants](https://www.nature.com/articles/) increase alertness, attention and energy. They create a sense of wellbeing, which contributes to the risk of becoming addicted to them. They increase heart rate and blood pressure. They can decrease appetite and contribute to dry mouth. If the dose is too high, it can cause anxiety, agitation and full panic. On rare occasions, they trigger psychotic states. Withdrawal often produces a crash in energy, focus, and mood, including severe depression.

Because meth causes greater, faster dopamine release than does amphetamine, it tends to be associated with more euphoria, and [more of the negative effects](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09595230801923702): physical restlessness, [tooth grinding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22782046/), cardiac problems, [addiction](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23907377/), and psychosis. Meth use has been associated with developing Parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and [irreversible brain damage](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S086743611600002X), problems that have been hard to document for amphetamine. In [some studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22209365/), meth also seems to overshoot and yield little or no beneficial effects on alertness and attention.

[Meth specifically enhances sexual pleasure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5086781/), while simultaneously delaying orgasm, leading to its popular recreational use to enable prolonged bouts of sexual activity. The extended length of time and the wear and tear on genital tissue increase the risk of spreading sexually transmitted diseases. More alarmingly, meth, in [rats](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7317298/) or [humans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22050030/), leads to [greater risk-taking](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-019-1019-y), or not even being able to appreciate that one is making dangerous decisions. Meth use substantially [elevates the risk of testing positive for HIV](https://journals.lww.com/jaids/Fulltext/2020/11010/The_Crisis_We_Are_Not_Talking_About__One_in_Three.3.aspx).

Not only do meth and amphetamine interact differently with neurochemical receptors and transporters, but three additional factors also cause these two drugs to alter brains in dissimilar ways. People tend to administer the two drugs differently, time their use differently, and consume the drugs in different social milieus.

Most people consume meth by smoking, snorting it, or using it intravenously. In contrast, people usually ingest amphetamine. The preferred methods of meth consumption result in much faster absorption, and more rapid access to the brain, compared to swallowing the drug. Rapid rewards tend to encourage repeated use.

Meth is considerably more likely to trigger addiction than amphetamine. Furthermore, within dopamine pathways, it’s not just the amount of dopamine available at receptors or transporters that determines the response; the speed at which concentrations change also plays a role. These systems respond differently to quick surges than to prolonged presence.

Binging, or consuming large quantities over the span of several days, remains the classic pattern of meth use, whereas most people taking prescription amphetamine to take a regular dose on a daily schedule. [Both in rats and in humans, stimulant binges](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9262316/), in contrast to sustained use, lead to more potent downregulation of dopaminergic systems, different behavioral patterns, more toxicity, and more likelihood of addiction.

The common social and psychological environments for meth use also differ from that of amphetamine use. Those consuming amphetamines are more likely to take their drug in the presence of social supports who can help regulate drug intake, address any adverse effects, and encourage healthy patterns of self-care. When using meth alone or in the company of other impaired individuals, one loses these safeguards and positive reinforcements.

## **Are Stimulants Mething up society?**

In pre-WWII Germany, meth [was widely available](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1522864911500162?via%3Dihub) without a prescription, and the military encouraged soldiers to utilize the drug to stay alert and keep fighting. Only when meth withdrawal crashes and acts of meth-induced violence became too frequent and disruptive did officials curtail its use. By 1941 the government made it only available by prescription.

Many Americans, including many doctors, mistakenly believe that meth is only available in the US as a street drug. But decades ago the FDA approved meth for treating ADHD in children and to combat obesity. Sold under the name Desoxyn, meth prescriptions face the identical level of restriction (schedule II controlled substance) as amphetamine or Ritalin.

About [five times as many Americans are prescribed opioid pain medications](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/NSDUH-FFR2-2015/NSDUH-FFR2-2015.htm) as are prescribed stimulants, according to the aptly abbreviated National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH = No shit! Duh!). But only 12% of individuals prescribed pain medications misuse or abuse them, whereas almost a third of stimulant users reported misuse.

And in contrast to opioids, where [prescription medication users are over one hundred times](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/deaths/other-drugs.html#anchor_1636144722012) more numerous than heroin users, among stimulant users, people taking prescribed medication are only 2–3 times more common than those abusing meth. Furthermore, stimulant abuse runs a substantially higher risk of ending in death than does opioid abuse. We’re in for an ugly stimulant epidemic.

Not only do we seem societally unaware and unprepared for this stimulant epidemic, we also have fewer medical resources to fight it. Nothing like methadone or buprenorphine, which helps many individuals curtail their opioid addictions, exists for stimulants.

Controlled dosing of [amphetamine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25154010/) or methylphenidate to curb meth use appears doesn’t work. Investigators are looking at a host of other medications, and even vaccines, to fight stimulant addiction, but we still lack a widely effective treatment. Behavioral modification approaches can help some individuals give up meth.

We must learn from the opioid crisis, and increase our efforts to educate the public, prescribers, and those taking prescription stimulants about the risks of addiction, and how meth poses far more risks and dangers than prescription stimulants. We must avoid the overreaction we currently see with opioid prescribing, where doctors abruptly reduced or stopped medications that controlled suffering and improved functioning for thousands of individuals.

It’s okay to get angry and alarmed about people abusing speed. But there should be meth(od) to our madness. We need to crystalize our focus on meth abuse and take steps to ensure that we do not eliminate beneficial medications for those who are responsibly using stimulants to mitigate their ADHD, narcolepsy, or other conditions.
