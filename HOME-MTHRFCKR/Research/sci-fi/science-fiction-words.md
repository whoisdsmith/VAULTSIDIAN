Wave mechanics. 
A theory of atomic structure put forward by Louis de Broglie in 1924, in which electrons are considered as wave phenomena close to the nucleus and executing oscillations in a series of definite frequencies which correspond to energy levels of the atom. The ‘wave’ however is not regarded as having a real existence, since this would entail a multidimensional hyperspace. Wave terminology is used in order to express the mathematical relations involved.
