## Cyberpunk Words, Terms, and Phrases

Slang words are the deep-fried whale sperm of the language world. They're esoteric, controversial delicacies enjoyed by a select few insiders who carefully cultivate a sophisticated, sometimes-isolating sense of appreciation.

While contemporary slang is nothing to shake a stick at, I have a particularly soft spot for slang from distant times. Historical is particularly delicious, but what I enjoy even more is slang teetering on the cutting edge of our future.

What I'm referring to is geek slang, cyberpunk slang, and other slang that is created in near-future and science fiction novels. Just as the sci-fi genre predicts how we will live and behave in the future, it hypothesizes our future speech patterns as well, and boy, do they ever get colorful!

What follows is an index of some of my favorite cyberpunk slang terms used by fictional characters of the future. I propose that we start using these words and phrases _now_! Why not make the prophecies come true??

## Origins of These Futuristic-Sounding Words

Before we dive into my index of cyberpunk and geeky science fiction slang, let us take a moment to meditate on its diverse origins. Some of the writers who coined the words and phrases that follow did so nearly 100 years ago. Others repurposed slang that was even older—or is already in use in some regions of the world.

To trace each word and phrase to its origin, please refer to the book credits section of this guide. Each word is given a number corresponding to a book.

Bon appetit!

## Words for "Internet"

There are many different words used by forward-thinking people today _and_ science fiction authors to describe the Internet. Many emerged from "series of tubes," a term originating from a [meme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes) surrounding once-senator Ted Stevens' lack of Internet understanding.
