**Light-year** The distance that light can travel in one year. This is how distance is measured in space. One light-year is about 9.5 trillion kilometres!

**Lunar eclipse** A phenomenon caused by the Earth passing between the sun and a full moon, causing the Earth’s shadow to fall on the moon.

**Major planet** Any of the eight planets of our solar system, as opposed to an asteroid or moon.

**Meridian** An imaginary line from the North Pole to the South Pole.

**Meteor** A rock from space that enters Earth’s atmosphere and burns away as a streak of light. We also call it a shooting star. If a meteor survives the plunge and lands on Earth, it’s called a meteorite.

**Milky Way** This spiral-shaped galaxy contains our solar system and hundreds of billions of stars. It can be seen by the naked eye as a luminous band across the sky.

**Nebula** This giant cloud of dust and gas in space contains the raw materials stars are made of.

**Neutron star** A massive star that dies in a supernova explosion and collapses to create one of the densest objects in the universe.

**Nova** A star that suddenly shines brightly for a few months due to a nuclear explosion before returning to its original state.

**Orbit** The curved path a celestial object takes around a star, moon  
or planet.

**Umbra** The innermost and darkest part of a shadow cast by an illuminated body that blocks all light. The moon’s umbra causes total solar eclipses.

the size of the Earth.
