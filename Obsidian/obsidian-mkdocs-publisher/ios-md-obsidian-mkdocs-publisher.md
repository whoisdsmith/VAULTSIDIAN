# Ios.md - Obsidian Mkdocs Publisher

---
The script support IOS using :

-   [a-shell](https://holzschu.github.io/a-Shell_iOS/) (Free)
-   [Pyto](https://pyto.app/) ($3 lite version / $10 complete version) [1](https://obsidian-publisher.netlify.app/python/ios/#fn:1)
-   [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/) (Free for student / $19)

Warning

The option `mobile` will **never** push. You need to use Working Copy to push the converted file.

You can :

1.  Share the entire vault : `obs2mk --mobile all --vault`
2.  Share a specific file, using its name : `obs2mk --mobile file "filename"`.[2](https://obsidian-publisher.netlify.app/python/ios/#fn:2) This option can be used especially with [Shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/welcome/ios)
