Yes.

I was hoping to get voicemail so I could leave them a message, give you a playback a couple times later, they've sent it to me.

But, fucking genius dude, they're sort of an app.

Well, it was started out as a shortcut, just to get the concept of it.

But, I thought of it and I'm like, yeah, I could use that.

And then, the way to track what happens and write it down, not with your diary, but your electronic diary, and creating a thing that you set up your routine, it checks with you to make sure, like, the app, you set up your routine, then, after you set it up, it checks with you at different stages.

So, like, if that time is the same time for every day, then, it would check, like, ten minutes before that, like, are you going to go to bed?

And, you could respond with a yes or no.

Or, no, and you could delay it a little bit, like, or more defensive, like, 30 minutes late.

But then, so, instead of, like, tracking your fucking screen time, it would also track your time, how much of the shit you said you were going to do, did you do, and following what you wanted, instead of letting shit deter you.

And, then, it would be pretty fun.

Not you, personally, but the user.

And, at first, I thought of, like, a way of it being where, I guess, I would know how to use it, but nobody else would.

And, then, your reflections would, the idea of them, really click the second half of it, where it's user friendly, instead of, you had to use it a certain way.

And, then, you could, at the end of the week or day, you could probably start out with week, and then go to day, then back to week, if you were doing good at maintaining and doing what you're training.

So, whether it be cooking dinner at a certain time, or, and, plan for unplanned activities, you know, like, three times, from this time to this time on Friday, you know.

Then, if you miss 30% or more, instead of checking in every other day, you would check in with a reflection on it, it would do it sooner.

And, then, as soon as you get the numbers up, it starts spacing out the reflection times, so that it would be, like, a weekly thing, and it would never get further out than a week.

But, then, you would, after your week is consistent, you'd be able to set goals for in a couple months.

And, then, every other week, it would check how you're doing with that goal.

And, once you get the numbers up, it would be a week.

So if you're listening to this one first, stop and listen to the other one, and come back.

So it would be like bi-weekly, checking in on it, like a three-month goal.

And if you answer no, and instead of it being two weeks out before it checks, it's going to check a week after, and those kind of things.

Then after the week, if you don't, it would pretty much be like, so just take it out of focus.

Is your routine for the weeklies set up right?

And then, not set up right, but are you following it?

And then after it's followed, if it is being followed, then see if the goal needs adjusted.

But if it's not being followed, like you're missing bedtimes and shit like that, it would be an act for fucking self-discipline, I guess, in a way.

But it's hard sometimes to just wake up and be focused on goals without self-discipline.

Like, without, because that's all I know.

Anyway, then working towards those goals and even longer-term goals, or more than one three-month goal, I think, I don't know, it would be cool to create that, even if it's just for personal use.

But yeah, I wouldn't want to try to learn how to use actual app-creating software, because I would get lost in learning the whole interface and how to create the stuff on there that it would end up just delaying making what I was trying to make.

So I'd probably just write it out or type it out, the different ideas, and then what it would look like, and then just kind of create the functions of it.

But anyway, I don't know if this is weird that I love these questions like this, butâ€¦

Well, I've got to go to bed.

Don't tell anybody.

I'll show this anyway, even if you think it's cute.

All right, I'm going to get off here, though.

Bye, everyone.
