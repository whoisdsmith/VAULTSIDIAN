# rd-prompt2

**User:**  
In javascript, using the raindrop.io API, can you give me an example of how to:

1. print a list of all my public collections.
2. do a loop through each collection, printing the "Title", "link", "tags" and "date" of each bookmark.
3. output to a markdown file, using the name of the collection as the file name.

start a new chat for each step.
