"Imagine you are a modern artist creating a piece for [AlteredFuture]. Describe the artwork and explain why it is representative of AlteredFuture's mission."

## ASSISTANT
As a modern artist creating a piece for AlteredFuture, I would create an interactive installation titled "The Ripple Effect."

The installation would consist of a large, circular pool of water in the center of the room, surrounded by projected images of ocean waves and natural disasters. Visitors would be encouraged to toss pebbles into the water, causing ripples to form and spread across the surface.

As the ripples expand, the projected images would also shift and change, showing how one small action can have a ripple effect on the world around us. The installation would be accompanied by a soundtrack of calming, ambient music mixed with sounds of nature and news reports of environmental disasters.

This artwork is representative of AlteredFuture's mission because it encourages visitors to consider the impact of their actions on the environment and the world as a whole. By demonstrating the ripple effect of even small actions, the installation inspires viewers to take responsibility for their role in creating a sustainable future. It also highlights the interconnectedness of all living things and the importance of taking action to protect our planet.
