5. Data transformation: The process of converting data from one format to another or applying mathematical or statistical operations to it in order to make it more suitable for analysis.
6. Data shaping: The process of reshaping data into a desired format, such as pivoting, stacking, or merging columns or rows.
7. Data cleansing: A term used to describe the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in data.

Text wrangling:

1. Text cleaning: The process of removing unwanted characters, symbols, or formatting from text data.
2. Text preprocessing: The process of preparing text data for analysis by converting it into a more suitable format, such as converting it to lowercase or removing stop words.
3. Text normalization: The process of converting text data into a standard format or representation, such as converting words to their base form (lemmatization) or replacing synonyms with a common term (word stemming).
4. Text manipulation: The process of changing or transforming text data in order to prepare it for analysis.
5. Text transformation: The process of converting text data from one format to another, such as converting it from unstructured to structured data.
6. Text parsing: The process of analyzing text data to identify patterns or extract information from it, such as identifying named entities or parsing a sentence into its constituent parts.
7. Text formatting: The process of changing the appearance or layout of text data, such as changing font size or adding bullet points.
8. Tokenization: The process of breaking down text into smaller units called tokens, such as words or phrases. This can be useful for text analysis, as it allows for counting and comparing individual units of text. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" could be tokenized into: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"].
9. Stop word removal: The process of removing common words that occur frequently in text but do not carry much meaning, such as "the", "and", and "of". This can help reduce noise and improve the accuracy of text analysis. For example, the sentence "The cat in the hat sat on the mat" with stop word removal would become "cat hat sat mat".
10. Stemming: The process of reducing words to their root or base form, such as "run" for "running" or "dog" for "dogs". This can help group together related words and reduce the number of unique words in a dataset. For example, the words "running", "runs", and "run" could all be stemmed to "run".
11. Lemmatization: Similar to stemming, but instead of reducing words to a base form, it converts them to their dictionary form. For example, the word "am", "are", and "is" can all be lemmatized to "be".
12. Part-of-speech tagging: The process of assigning a part of speech to each word in a sentence, such as noun, verb, adjective, or adverb. This can help identify the role of each word in a sentence and can be useful for tasks like named entity recognition. For example, in the sentence "The cat in the hat sat on the mat", part-of-speech tagging would identify "cat" and "hat" as nouns and "sat" as a verb.
13. Named entity recognition: The process of identifying and categorizing specific named entities within text, such as people, organizations, and locations. This can be useful for tasks like information extraction and sentiment analysis. For example, in the sentence "Barack Obama was the 44th president of the United States", named entity recognition would identify "Barack Obama" as a person and "the United States" as a location.
14. Text summarization: The process of generating a shorter version of a longer text while retaining the most important information. This can be done by extracting key sentences or phrases, or by using machine learning algorithms to generate a summary. For example, a news article about a sports game could be summarized to highlight the final score and key moments in the game.

1. Sentiment analysis: The process of identifying and categorizing the emotional tone of a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. This can be useful for tasks like brand monitoring and customer feedback analysis. For example, in the sentence "I loved the movie, it was amazing!", sentiment analysis would identify the overall sentiment as positive.
2. Text classification: The process of assigning predefined categories or labels to a piece of text, such as spam/not spam, topic classification, or sentiment classification. This can be useful for tasks like content filtering and topic modeling. For example, a news article could be classified into categories like politics, sports, or entertainment.
3. Topic modeling: The process of identifying topics or themes that are present in a collection of documents or pieces of text. This can be useful for tasks like content analysis and recommendation systems. For example, a collection of news articles could be analyzed to identify common topics like politics, sports, and entertainment.
4. Word embedding: The process of representing words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, such that similar words have similar vector representations. This can be useful for tasks like semantic analysis and document clustering. For example, the word "cat" and "dog" might have similar vector representations because they are both associated with animals, while the word "car" would have a different vector representation.
5. Regular expressions: A sequence of characters that forms a search pattern, used to match and manipulate text. This can be useful for tasks like text cleaning and data extraction. For example, a regular expression could be used to find all email addresses in a piece of text.

Sure, here are a few more terms and processes for text wrangling:

1. Text normalization: The process of converting text to a standardized format, such as converting all text to lowercase or removing punctuation marks. This can help reduce the number of unique words in a dataset and improve the accuracy of text analysis.
2. Text clustering: The process of grouping similar pieces of text together based on their content. This can be useful for tasks like document categorization and recommendation systems. For example, a clustering algorithm could group together news articles that are all related to the same topic.
3. Named entity disambiguation: The process of resolving ambiguous named entities in text, such as identifying which "John Smith" is being referred to. This can be challenging due to the variety of ways that named entities can be referred to, and can require additional context or external knowledge sources.
4. Word sense disambiguation: The process of identifying the correct meaning of a word in a particular context, such as distinguishing between the noun and verb senses of the word "bat". This can be useful for tasks like machine translation and information retrieval.
5. Dependency parsing: The process of analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence to identify relationships between words, such as subject-verb or noun-modifier relationships. This can be useful for tasks like information extraction and question answering.
6. Text generation: The process of using machine learning algorithms to generate new pieces of text that are similar in style or content to existing text. This can be useful for tasks like chatbots and content creation. For example, a text generation algorithm could be trained on a collection of news articles to generate new articles on similar topics.

1. Text annotation: The process of adding additional information to text, such as part-of-speech tags, named entity tags, or sentiment labels. This can be useful for building machine learning models that require labeled data.
2. Text augmentation: The process of generating new variations of existing text data, such as by swapping synonyms, reordering sentences, or adding noise. This can be useful for increasing the size of a dataset or improving the robustness of machine learning models.
3. Entity linking: The process of connecting named entities in text to external knowledge sources, such as Wikipedia or Freebase. This can be useful for tasks like information extraction and question answering.
4. Text compression: The process of reducing the size of a piece of text while retaining its essential information. This can be useful for tasks like text summarization and data storage. For example, a text compression algorithm might represent a sentence as a sequence of codes that can be reconstructed into the original sentence.
5. Text segmentation: The process of dividing a piece of text into smaller segments, such as paragraphs or sentences. This can be useful for tasks like text summarization and machine translation.
6. Text alignment: The process of matching corresponding segments of text in two or more documents or translations. This can be useful for tasks like machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval.
7. Text-to-speech conversion: The process of converting written text into spoken audio. This can be useful for tasks like accessibility and language learning.

Overall, text wrangling involves a wide range of techniques and processes for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing text data. The specific techniques and processes used will depend on the particular task at hand and the nature of the text data being analyzed.
