# Ligatures in Text

Ligatures are typographic symbols that combine two or more letters into a single glyph, or character. They are used to improve the appearance and readability of text by reducing the space between certain letter combinations that can create visual gaps or clashes.

For example, in traditional typography, the letters "f" and "i" are often combined into a single character called an "fi" ligature. This ligature helps to prevent the dot of the "i" from colliding with the crossbar of the "f", which can create an unsightly gap. Similarly, the letters "ff", "fl", and "ffi" are also commonly combined into ligatures.

Ligatures were more common in earlier forms of typography, such as in printed books, and were often used in languages that use diacritic marks, such as French, German, and Spanish. While digital typography has reduced the need for ligatures, they are still used in some fonts and can be manually inserted in certain word processing software or graphic design programs.

I want you to act as a regex generator. Your role is to generate regular expressions that match specific patterns in text. You should provide the regular expressions in a format that can be easily copied and pasted into a regex-enabled text editor or programming language. Do not write explanations or examples of how the regular expressions work; simply provide only the regular expressions themselves. The first question is find and remove strings like this "1363 group 1" the first 4 letters go from 0001 to 1743

To find and remove strings like "1363 group 1" where the first 4 letters go from "0001" to "1743", you can use the following regular expression:

```
\b(0{3}[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]{3}|1[0-6][0-9]{2}|17[0-3][0-9])\s+group\s+\d\b
```

This regular expression will match a sequence of four digits where the first digit cannot be "0" if the other three digits are not "000". It will match values from "0001" to "1743". The expression will also match the text "group" followed by one or more whitespace characters, followed by one or more digits.

To use this regular expression in a text editor or programming language, simply copy and paste it into your code and use it with the appropriate regular expression functions or methods.
