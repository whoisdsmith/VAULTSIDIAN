# Handling Text Files

Working with hundreds of text files can involve a variety of tasks, such as reading, writing, modifying, and analyzing the content of the files. Below, I've provided an overview of some common tasks you might perform when working with a large number of text files, along with Python code snippets to help you get started:

1. Reading text files:

```python
filenames = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]  # List of filenames
file_contents = []
for filename in filenames:
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        file_contents.append(content)
```

2. Writing text files:

```python
filenames = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]  # List of filenames
texts_to_write = ["Text for file1", "Text for file2", ...]  # Text to write in each file
for filename, text in zip(filenames, texts_to_write):
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(text)
```

3. Appending text to existing files:

```python
filenames = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]  # List of filenames
texts_to_append = ["Text to append to file1", "Text to append to file2", ...]  # Text to append
for filename, text in zip(filenames, texts_to_append):
    with open(filename, "a") as f:
        f.write(text)
```

4. Searching for a specific string in all files:

```python
search_string = "target text"
filenames = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]  # List of filenames
files_containing_string = []
for filename in filenames:
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        if search_string in content:
            files_containing_string.append(filename)
```

5. Counting occurrences of a specific string in all files:

```python
search_string = "target text"
filenames = ["file1.txt", "file2.txt", ...]  # List of filenames
string_counts = {}
for filename in filenames:
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        content = f.read()
        count = content.count(search_string)
        string_counts[filename] = count
```

Please note that these examples assume that you have a list of filenames (`filenames`) that you want to work with. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to modify the code to suit your needs. Additionally, if you're working with a very large number of files, you may want to consider more efficient approaches to reading and processing the data, such as using memory mapping or parallel processing.
