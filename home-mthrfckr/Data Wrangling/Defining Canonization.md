# Defining Canonization

The term "canonize" has a few different meanings, depending on the context:

1. In a religious context, "canonize" means to officially declare someone to be a saint. This process typically involves a thorough investigation of the person's life, writings, and miracles, and may require the approval of the Pope or other religious leaders.
2. In literature and the arts, "canonize" can refer to the process of elevating certain works or artists to a position of high esteem and cultural significance. For example, Shakespeare's plays are often considered to be part of the "literary canon" of English literature.
3. In mathematics, "canonize" means to transform an object into a standard form or representation. For example, a graph may be canonized by relabeling the vertices so that they appear in a specific order or by removing duplicate edges.

Overall, "canonize" typically implies a process of formal recognition or standardization, whether in the realms of religion, culture, or academia.

what does it mean in BBedit

In the context of BBEdit, which is a text editor software for macOS, "canonize" refers to the process of converting text into a standard format or style.

Specifically, the "Text > Canonize" command in BBEdit applies a set of rules or guidelines to reformat the selected text in a consistent manner. For example, it can be used to:

- Convert line endings to a specific format (e.g. from Windows-style to Unix-style)
- Remove extraneous whitespace (e.g. multiple spaces or tabs)
- Normalize the case of text (e.g. converting all characters to uppercase or lowercase)
- Convert special characters or symbols to their equivalent text representations (e.g. replacing "smart quotes" with regular quotes)

By canonizing text in this way, BBEdit can help ensure that it conforms to a specific standard or style, which can be useful for tasks like code formatting, data cleaning, or text preparation for publishing.

in BBedit what does it mean to strip quotes?

In BBEdit, the term "strip quotes" refers to the process of removing quotation marks (or other types of quote characters) from a block of text. This can be useful in a variety of contexts, such as when you are:

- Extracting text from a document that contains unnecessary or unwanted quotation marks.
- Removing formatting from a text file or document, such as when preparing text for use in a script or programming language.
- Normalizing text to a particular style or format, such as when dealing with inconsistent quotation mark usage across different sources or documents.

To strip quotes in BBEdit, you can use the "Text > Strip Quotes" command, which removes all instances of quotation marks (both single and double quotes) from the selected text. Alternatively, you can use the "Text > Strip Smart Quotes" command, which removes "smart quotes" (also known as curly quotes or typographer's quotes) and replaces them with straight quotes.

in BBedit what is Zap Gremlins?

In BBEdit, "Zap Gremlins" is a feature that allows you to quickly identify and remove non-printing or "invisible" characters from a block of text. These characters, sometimes called "gremlins," can include things like tabs, line breaks, carriage returns, and other control characters that may not be visible but can affect how your text is displayed or processed.

To use the "Zap Gremlins" feature in BBEdit, you can select the text you want to clean up and then choose "Text > Zap Gremlins" from the menu bar. This will open a dialog box that allows you to specify which types of gremlins you want to remove, such as whitespace, line breaks, or specific control characters. Once you have made your selections, you can click the "Zap" button to remove the selected gremlins from the text.

This feature can be useful for cleaning up text that has been copied and pasted from other sources, or for preparing text for use in programming or other technical contexts where non-printing characters can cause problems. By removing these gremlins, you can ensure that your text is clean, consistent, and easy to work with.
