# Love Is Living Tissue

​

Love Is A Four Letter Word That Is Somehow Connected To The Heart, How This Is Possible I Have No Clue Because Words Are Just Letters That Form A Language & How That Language Gets Transferred Into Your Body, Your Blood Stream & To Your Heart Is The Greatest Mystery Rocket All Time… I Am Not God, Nor A Rocket Scientist, Nor A Professor, Nor Do I Know Everything. I Am Merely An Over Grown Man Child Who Has His Beliefs. These Are Merely My Thoughts & Opinions, So You Can Choose To See Them However You Want. Love Has A Mind Of Its Own, It Tells You What It Wants, Whether You Agree With It Or Not! It's Funny, I Don't Believe There Are Any Other Words That Can Control Your Body. Maybe Love Is Many Things, I Suppose. There's Love That You Have For Family & Friends And There's Love That Makes You Grasp For Air & Fills Your Mid-Half With "Butterflies" That Same Love Fills Your Head Up With Wonder & Joy & Belonging… Love For The Most Part Is A Healthy Organism, Or Maybe Just A Vitamin Filled With Nutrients That Don't Taste Like Shitty Flintstones Tablets. Love Can Also Be A Foreign Object, Something Your Body Resects. This Love Is Not Good Love, It Is Brutal & Sometimes Deadly… Symptoms Include Heavy Nausea, Insomnia, It Makes Lakes Out Of Your Eyes & Mudslides Out Of Your Nose… It Finds Every Good Cell & Infects Them With Its Negative Toxins… At One Point In Life, I Believe We All Have Suffered From This Betrayal. Love Is An Addiction & When You Feed Into It Every Day, It's A Gamble You Cannot Stop. When I Was Young I Thought I Knew What Love Was. I Thought That If I Had Strong Feelings For Someone & They Had Them Too, Then I'd Be Happy Forever. Trouble Was, I Kept Having That Feeling For Multiple People. I Think What Happened Was I Fell Asleep In English Class & Woke Up Disoriented & Confused When A Lecture About "Love + Lust" Was Going On And I Got The Two Words Confused. Whoops My Bad!

I Have Found That My Creativity Comes & Goes In Unpredictable Waves, Like One Minute I'm In The Middle Of Making The Greatest Shit Ever & Then Bam!! The Next, I'm Swimming In A Kiddie Pool Foaming Out The Mouth As Though I Have Severe Down Syndrome…

Which Maybe I Do, Maybe This Is All In My Head & I'm Just Floating In Some Foreign Abyss Of My Mind.

Nothing Makes Much Sense When I'm In These States Of Mind, As If My Brain Was A Country, Maybe The Brain Is A Country And Every Emotion Is A State.

Why Is It So Hard For Us To Just Stay Put? Sporadically, My Moods Start In Michigan & Travel To Indiana, Which Translates As Michigan = Happy And Indiana = Normal…

Then There Are Days I Wake Up Wondering How I Got To Nebraska, Teleport Back To Michigan & Somehow End The Day In Fucking Iraq…

And As You May Or May Not Know, Iraq Is Not A State Nor Is It Even Connected To The Country That My Brain Is In…

Fuck I Forgot Where I Was Going With This, I Think My Point Was That I Started This Day Off As "Blah" Then It Got Better than I Ended Up In Iraq Which Could Only Mean "Angry & In Hell".

# Incase You Don't Know Or I Forget

For Those Who Don't Know & (For Me, Incase I Forget.)

My Name Is Dustin Smith,

But I Prefer D. Smith Because I Love The D. (Insert Bad Drawing Of Wiener Here) I Haven't Even Finished My Intro & I'm Already Making Dick Jokes!

Anyway, I Was Born March 20Th, 1985. I Had A Good Four Years As An 80'S Child, Just Wish I Could Remember Them!

(One Thing I Should Make Clear If I Haven't Already)

My Memory Is Shit! Truth Is, I Don't Remember 90% Of My Youth, Which Sucks Because I Had A Good Life Growing Up With A Loving & Caring Family.

As For Me In My Adult Years, I Don't Remember Much Either And That Makes Shit Really Difficult Because I Hate Forgetting!

Another Thing I Should Mention Is That I Have Adhd & That Complicates Shit Even More.

I Would Also Like To Say There Probably Won't Be Any Kind Of Order To This, So If You're Not Already Confused, Don't Pucker Your Butt Cheeks Because You Most likely Will Be!

I Have Made Countless Mistakes & Bad Decisions..

​

I Learned The Hard Way About Most Of Them.

​

I've Been To The Top Of The World In Utter Joy & I Have Been To The Deepest Shit Holes In Hell.

​

These Words Can't Express How Much You Mean To Me, Or How Much I Love You.

​

One Day When You Have A Child Of Your Own You Will Understand.

​

My Hope Is That You Grow Up To Be A Better Man Than Me..

​

That You Choose Love Over Money & Hoes..

​

That You Learn To Control That Inner Anger That You Get From Me And Use It To Create Something Positive From It.

​

I Am Proud Of Who You Are, And I Have Faith That You Will Continue To Grow Into A Great Man..

​

I Don't Tell You That I Love You As Much As I Should. I Hope One Day You Understand Why I'm Not In Your Life Every Day.

​

I Love You, Son

I Don't Think It Really Matters What I Write Down Because Two Things Are Going To Happen…

- One Will Be That I'm Going To Forget What I Want To Say
    

And

- Two Will Be That I Never Finish What I Start.
    

So, What's The Point To This Diary Of Madness?

Well, I Guess I'm Just Hoping To Prove Myself Wrong & Break The Chains Of Being On Auto-Pilot…

The Same Shit Different Day Routines…

"Routines" That's The Word I Was Looking For When I Previously Said "Break The Chains Of Being On Auto-Pilot"

I Didn't Want To Use The Word "Auto-Pilot"

I Wanted Instead To Use "Routines"

Fuck It, Anyway, These Are Just Lines On A Sheet Of Paper, Maybe For Use To Start A Fire Some Day Or Maybe To Leave Behind For The People I Love And That Love Me Back.

In Other News, I Was Momentarily Interrupted By The Neighbors Screaming & Yelling, I Stepped Outside Only To Catch The End Of It… Damn!

# Shadows and Skeletons

It's been a long time since I have written words in diary form. It's been a night of defeat, of darkness & of failure.

I've always had some kind of words to say for any situation, but these days I struggle just to open my mouth.

I fumble to put together full sentences & my words usually end up wrong or silent.

I'm not sure when my voice & thoughts started to lose their place, maybe it was once I started taking the meds, or maybe it is something that's been building since my birth.

In the past, I have felt lost, broken & then I felt nothing at all. In the last 16 months I have managed to regain my emotions and purpose for being here, however I seem to lack the proper way to show off those feelings, at least all of them except anger.

Growing up, I had a short fuse and a temper to light it. Somewhere between Jr. High & High School, I seemed to outgrow it, or I just learned how to bury it. Either way, it found a way to outgrow me.

I do know how to love & I know how & what it feels like, but whatever chemical or process it takes to show it gets replaced by failure & anger.

My mind is weak, but my heart is strong, and this past year has made me live & move forward, casting light on what was once darkness.

Today I realized that the torch that's been guiding me, has also been leading my shadow, I found that you may be able to revive the goodness in your soul but at the risk of bringing something bad back as well.

This Shadow,  
This Skeleton,  
This Dark Energy,

That grabs a hold and doesn't let go, it is just a reminder that you cannot bury what you must confront.

The question is, will I find the courage to face it?

# Chapter Revision

Recently, I went back and rewrote the ending to the chapter of my marriage, because I wasn't able to see and understand the things that I do now.

You will grow to understand, that every page of a chapter turns into sub-pages of another chapter until that chapter has made its way to the end.

The original ending I wrote, made me out to be the victim who didn't do anything wrong.

Looking back now, I fucking hate when people use the words "victim" and "villain" when describing their relationships.

Because, there are no victims and there are no villains when it comes to being in a relationship.

There's only communication and connection.

Once you lose the ability to communicate with someone, you also lose the way to connect to them.

Misunderstanding and miscommunication are the real culprits as to why relationships end.

Ultimately, it is the fault of both parties for not taking responsibility for their lack of communication and the way they chose to not connect on issues that were important to the other person.

For those who disagree, I hope you come back to read this chapter a few years from now and realize that I too didn't believe the things Im writing now either, which is the reason and the whole point of why I've come back to rewrite it.

I've been defining my life as a book, where every major event is the starting point of a new chapter.

The chapter I shared with the person I married, is by far the longest chapter I have so far, because of how much time we had together, how much shit we went through and how it defined who we would become after it ended.

Not everyone gets to rewrite the endings in a chapter, some people probably don't want to, but I had to on this one because this chapter is and will always be important to who I was and who I am now.

One day, I hope you come to understand your own chapters and why they ended, and you go back and rewrite a new version, this time, with a little more honesty and a lot more understanding.

# Time


Time, There’s always too much of it, when we don't want it and never enough when we do. I often wonder what I would say to my younger self If I had the chance. I think I would tell me to stop living like tomorrow never comes and start living to build a future. To slow down and live in the moment and stop chasing the people who moved on from my life. All my life I’ve heard that “time heals everything” and it surely does indeed. Eventually. There is no quick solution to pain, loss, humility, etc, you heal when your heart and your soul finally come to agreement with each other. Stop wasting time on people who make excuses or ignore you. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. Stop wasting time on things that don’t matter, especially when the things that do matter are right in front of you. Your friends, your lover, your children, all of the people who want nothing but your attention. The more you ignore and neglect those people, the less they will want anything from you. Losing and failing doesn't make you a failure. Quitting does. Hold yourself accountable and take responsibility for your actions. Understand who you are, what you want and what you believe in, before you try to understand anyone else. You can’t fix people, you can only try and guide them. Some people are on a sinking ship when you meet them. Don’t sink to the abyss with them, their baggage and trauma are not yours to carry. All you can be is who you are. Nothing more, nothing less.
