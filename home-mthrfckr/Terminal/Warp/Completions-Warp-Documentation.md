Tab completions for common commands are built-in and work regardless of machine or directory (including SSH sessions). As with standard shell autocomplete, you activate completions by pressing `TAB`.

-   Navigate to a local git directory
    

-   Type `git checkout` (note the space) and then press `TAB`
    
    -   A menu will show all of your local branches. You can select one using your mouse or the `UP ↑`/`DOWN ↓` arrow keys.
        
    

To search for options and flags, you first need to type `-` (dash).

Discover what Warp can autocomplete by pressing `TAB`, or looking at the supported completions section below.
