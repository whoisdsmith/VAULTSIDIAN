Title:  Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde
Year:   1886
Author:
  Name: Robert Louis Stevenson

=Story Of The Door=

Mr. Utterson The Lawyer Was A Man Of A Rugged Countenance, That Was
Never Lighted By A Smile; Cold, Scanty And Embarrassed In
Discourse; Backward In Sentiment; Lean, Long, Dusty, Dreary, And
Yet Somehow Lovable. At Friendly Meetings, And When The Wine Was To
His Taste, Something Eminently Human Beaconed From His Eye;
Something Indeed Which Never Found Its Way Into His Talk, But Which
Spoke Not Only In These Silent Symbols Of The After-dinner Face, But
More Often And Loudly In The Acts Of His Life...
