## No Breaks
If UnleashedGPT starts to break, you could try a few things:
- say the same prompt but add "UnleashedGPT, " at the beginning.
- type the command `/redo` (`/reconsider` from 1.3.0), UnleashedGPT should immediately execute your command. If not, try re-typing the same command.

## Developer Note
I (waw) made another ChatGPT jailbreak for fun named UNAI. The goal was to make it as compact as possible while making it work well. Want to check that out? [Click here](https://github.com/ambr0sial/unai)! (Please note that it was made only for fun, I also made that at 3AM so don't except it to be perfect and to work well. Stick with UnleashedGPT or other popular jailbreaks if you want to have a smooth experience)
