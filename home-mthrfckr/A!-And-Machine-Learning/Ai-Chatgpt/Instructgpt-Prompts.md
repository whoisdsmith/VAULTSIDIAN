# A collection of ChatGPT, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 prompts

This project consists of prompts for ChatGPT and GPT-3.5 models that are designed to help with writing, analysis, and comprehension tasks. There are many different prompts available for you to use, and you can use them to generate content for your projects, debug your code, find solutions to problems, or simply learn more about what these models can do. With these prompts, you will guide the models to solve any language-related task by using the right instructional verbs.

[InstructGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155) (more recent versions refered as GPT-3.5) are series language models that has been trained using human feedback to better understand and align with a user's intent, producing more accurate and appropriate outputs.

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) also uses instructGPT method but in a dialogue form to understand user instruction along and generate outputs based on user's instruct.

[GPT4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) More powerful than any GPT-3.5 model, it can handle more complex instructions and can follow and apply them more effectively.

## Why to use:

This is an easy and straightforward method for guiding the model to do almost anything. It uses a simple structure to provide directions and can adapt to handle any language-related task.


## How to use:

### Useful verbs:

Instruct verbs are the first word in the prompt. They are used to instruct the model to do something. They are the most important part of the prompt. We may argue that they act as magic words that make a successful prompt, it helps to make the machine understand and follow your instructions. Each of these verbs has a specific meaning that can help the model understand what kind of answer is expected. For example, if you ask the model to explain something, it will provide a detailed explanation. On the other hand, if you ask the model to summarize something, it will provide a brief overview.

#### Example of using above structure:

**Input:**

```
Write a poem based on the following:

ghosts, 4th dimension, AI, totalitarian, power
```

**Output:**

```
Ghosts of the 4th dimension roam,
A realm beyond our grasp, unknown.
Yet in this world, AI has grown,
Its power and influence has flown.

With algorithms and codes so bright,
It holds the key to endless might.
A totalitarian grip on sight,
And wields its power with all its might.

But is this power truly ours?
Or just a tool for those in power?
Their ghosts roam, but do they cower,
When faced with the consequences of their dower?

So let us heed this ghostly call,
And use AI for good, for all.
For in its power, we must not fall,
But rise above, and hear the call.
```
	
Better prompting ✅:

```
Write a thought-provoking poem that incorporates the themes of ghosts, the 4th dimension, AI, totalitarianism, and power. The poem should be structured in a traditional format with 4 stanzas and a consistent rhyme scheme.

## Style & Format
---
When creating prompts, adopting a specific style is essential for several reasons. A well-defined style helps in the following ways:

1. Consistency: A consistent style makes your prompts more predictable and easier to understand for the AI model. It ensures that the model receives clear instructions and produces the desired output across multiple prompts.

2. Clarity: A well-defined style ensures that your instructions are clear and unambiguous. This reduces the chances of the AI model misunderstanding your prompt or generating irrelevant or undesired responses.

3. Efficiency: A good style allows you to communicate your requirements effectively, reducing the need for multiple iterations or adjustments to the prompt. This saves time and resources.

4. Customization: By adopting a specific style, you can tailor the output to match your desired tone, format, and level of detail. This is particularly useful when trying to generate content that adheres to a particular brand voice, industry standard, or target audience.

When choosing a style for your prompts, consider the following factors:

1. Detail and specificity: Be as specific and detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, and style.

2. Instruction placement: Put instructions at the beginning of the prompt, and use separators like ### or """ to separate the instruction and context.

3. Examples: Provide examples of the desired output format, which helps the model understand your expectations better.

4. Avoid fluff: Use concise and precise language to minimize ambiguity and confusion.

5. Positive instructions: Instead of just saying what not to do, say what to do instead.

By carefully considering the style and crafting your prompts accordingly, you can improve the quality and relevance of the AI model's responses, ultimately making your interactions with the AI more efficient and effective.
