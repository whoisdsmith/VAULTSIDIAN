### What is Prompt Engineering? 
Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining the initial text or input (the prompt) that is given to a language model like ChatGPT to generate a response. It involves designing prompts that guide the model to generate a specific tone, style, or type of content.

## Prompt Engineering: The Basics

- Use literal and explicit language
- Ask the model to act as if is an expert of the subject
- Ask the model to act as if it is a specific person, or combination of people 
- Ask the model to think 'step-by-step', especially in medium to complex tasks
