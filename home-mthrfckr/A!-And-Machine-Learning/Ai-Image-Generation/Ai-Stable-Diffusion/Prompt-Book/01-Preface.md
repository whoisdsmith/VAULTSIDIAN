## Prompt Engineering

engineering is the process of structuring words that can be interpreted and understood by a text-to-image model. Think of it as the language you need to speak in order to tell an AI model what to draw.

Prompt engineering is a great way to stretch the limitations of Text2IM models. Good ## Prompts can make images go from good to great.
