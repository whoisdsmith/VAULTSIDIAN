## Note

- On the NoteSeq, pick a scale that you wish to play with.
- On the first Basal oscillator, that is the so called bass strings.
- The second Basal oscillator, is the main strings (both oscillators have the Instruo ADSR)
- The Additive Vibration synth acts as the pluck synth
- Beneath the Additive Vibration is a self generating pluck that plays in the same key as the NoteSeq which you can adjust the loudness on the mixer.
- The bottom left is a “rain” like sound effect that I have created Note that you need to BE CAREFUL WITH THE TEXTURE SYNTH because if you pump the audio of the texture synth the whole effect will likely bust up with audio distortion which will not sound good so I would pay close attention with that. Anyways, the texture synth acts like a thunder crash.

I hope everyone will like this patch that me and another person put together. Because I love this one.

Sincerely,

Tyler-Ray
