## *"If I'm A Total Noob, Where Should I Start?"*

- [`Project μ`]: An Excellent And Free Online Blog That Neatly Explains The Basics Of DSP.
- [`Think DSP`]: A Great Free Online Book That Teaches Many Fundamental DSP Concepts Using Python.
- [`Designing Software Synthesizer Plug-Ins In C++`] And [`Designing Audio Effect Plugins In C++`] By Will Pirkle
    - These Textbooks Are A Common Recommendation For Beginners.
    - The Synthesizer One Is Better Than The Effect One Imo, So Go For That If You Plan On Only Buying One.
    - ISBN-10: 0367510480 And 1138591939, ISBN-13: 978-0367510480 And 978-1138591936
