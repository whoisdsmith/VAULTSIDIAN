Learning Resources And Tools For The Mathematics Of Audio DSP.

DSP (Digital Signal Processing) Is The Study Of Using A Digital Computer To Process What Is Normally Thought Of As An Analogue Signal (Such As Sound). Unfortunately (Or Fortunately Depending On Who You Are ðŸ˜‰), The Reality Is That DSP Is Quite A Math Heavy Field. However, The Math Needed To Get Started Is Not *Too* Difficult In My Opinion. Knowing High-school Level Math And Some Of The Basics Of College-level Math Will Get You Most Of The Way There.

## Prerequisites

I Recommend Knowing At Least These Fundamental Concepts In Order Best Get Started With Learning DSP:

- Algebra Dealing With Polynomials, Fractions, And Exponents (Exponents Are Especially Important Here)
- Basic Trigonometry Like Sine, Cosine, Tangent, Arctangent, Etc.
- Logarithms (Especially The Natural Logarithm And The Number "E")
- Complex (Imaginary) Numbers & Complex Algebra (Using Algebra With Complex Numbers). (Yes, Imaginary Numbers Do Actually Have A Real-world Use And Are A Core Pillar Of DSP Mathematics.)
- Basic Knowledge Of Linear Algebra (The Study Of Transforming Data With Matrices). (You *Can* Get By Without This, But This Is Really Helpful When It Comes To Actually Implementing The Mathematics Into Code.)
- Basic Knowledge Of Calculus Such As Derivatives And Integrals. (You *Can* Get By Without This, But It Will Really Help You To Understand Why Things Are The Way They Are.)
  - In The Topic Of Calculus, Basic Knowledge Of What Differential Equations Are And Why They Are Important Will Also Help (Although I'm Not Talking About How To Actually *Solve* Differential Equations, Because They Are "Really Freakin' Hard To Solve" To Put It Lightly)
