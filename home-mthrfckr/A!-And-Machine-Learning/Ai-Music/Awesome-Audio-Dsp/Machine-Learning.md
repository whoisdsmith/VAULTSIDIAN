# Machine Learning

Machine Learning Has Been Gaining Traction In The Audio Industry Lately. I Don't Know Much About The Topic Myself, But I'll Link Some Potentially Useful Resources Here If You're Interested.

- [`3Blue1Brown - Neural Networks`] - An Excellent Short Series Of YouTube Videos Explaining The Basics Of How Machine Learning Actually Works.
- [`RTNeural`] - A Fast Neural Inferencing Library In C++ Made Specifically For Audio Plugins. Used By The [`Chowdhury DSP`] Suite Of Plugins.
- [`SmartCore`] - An Advanced And Comprehensive Machine Learning Library Written In The [`Rust`] Programming Language.

## Open Source Projects

Some Open Source Projects That Make Use Of Machine Learning For Audio.

- [`Chowdhury DSP`] - A Suite Of Open Source Audio Plugins. Many Of Them Make Use Of Machine Learning.
- [`Ultimate Vocal Remover`] - A State-of-the-art Program That Uses Machine Learning To Separate Vocals From A Mix.
