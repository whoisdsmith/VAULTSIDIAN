# Free Online Textbooks & Courses

A List Of Free Online Textbooks And Courses On Audio DSP.

- [`Project μ`] By Yü Fang
  - An Incredible Online Guide Walking You Through How Audio DSP Works With Examples Of Common Algorithms To Get You Started.
  - Shows Very Clearly How To Apply These Algorithms In Actual Code, And Also Has Helpful And Nice Looking Graphs.
  - Requires Knowledge Of Complex Numbers, Integral Calculus, And The C Programming Language. (It Is Also Very Unix-focused).
  - Currently A Work In Progress, And More Tutorials Will Likely Be Added Later.
- [`Think DSP`] By Allen B. Downey
  - A Great Free Online Book For Beginners That Teaches Many Fundamental DSP Concepts Using Python.
  - Teaches Concepts From A Programming-based Approach, Rather Than An Abstract Mathematical Approach.
  - Requires Knowledge Of Python, And Some Knowledge Of Complex Numbers And Integral Calculus.
- [`The Scientist And Engineer's Guide To Digital Signal Processing`] By Steven W. Smith, Ph.D.
  - A Common Recommendation From Many Folks.
  - Focuses On DSP In General, Not Just Audio DSP.
  - Relatively Heavy On Mathematics.
- [`MIT OCW: Signals And Systems`] By Prof. Dennis Freeman
  - A Free Online College Level Course Including Pre-recorded Video Lectures, Lecture Notes, And Assignments.
  - Here Is A Link To The [`Video Lectures On Youtube`](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61kdPAOC7CzFjJZ8f1eMUxs) If You Can't Get The Videos To Play On Their Website.
- [`Julius Orion Smith III Collection`]
  - A Great Collection Of Books And Resources By Julius Orion Smith III.
  - Very Comprehensive, And Covers Many Topics On The Mathematics And Applications Of Audio DSP. Good For Getting A Solid Foundation.
  - Contains Code Examples In C And MatLab (Although [`GNU Octave`] Can Be Used As Well).
  - Relatively Heavy On Mathematics.
